From algorithms curating social media feeds to personal assistants on smartphones and home devices, AI has become part of everyday life for millions of people across the world.\n\nThe future of that human-tech relationship may one day involve AI systems being able to learn entirely on their own, becoming more efficient, self-supervised and integrated within a variety of applications and professions.\n\nBut some on social media claim this evolution toward AI autonomy has already happened.\n\n\"Facebook recently shut down two of its AI robots named Alice & Bob after they started talking to each other in a language they made up,\" reads a graphic shared July 18 by the Facebook group Scary Stories & Urban Legends.\n\nThe post, which has more than 1,500 interactions, goes on to claim the two AIs created their language to \"communicate faster and more efficiently.\" Above the text is an image of Han the Robot, which debuted at the RISE Technology Conference in Hong Kong in July 2017.\n\nSome elements of this futuristic tale are true. Facebook did have two AI-powered chatbots named Alice and Bob that learned to communicate with each other in a more efficient way.\n\nBut this didn't happen recently. And Facebook didn't shut down Alice and Bob.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Scary Stories & Urban Legends for comment.\n\nAlice and Bob were negotiation chatbots\n\nChatbots are computer programs that mimic human conversations through text. Because chatbots aren't yet capable of more sophisticated functions beyond, say, answering customer questions or ordering food, Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research Group (FAIR) set out to see if these programs could be taught to negotiate.\n\nThe result: Alice and Bob.\n\nUsing a game where the two chatbots, as well as human players, bartered virtual items such as books, hats and balls, Alice and Bob demonstrated they could make deals with varying degrees of success, the New Scientist reported.\n\nThe post's claim that the bots spoke to each other in a made-up language checks out.\n\nFacebook observed the language when Alice and Bob were negotiating among themselves. Researchers realized they hadn't incentivized the bots to stick to rules of English, so what resulted was seemingly nonsensical dialogue.\n\n\"Agents will drift off understandable language and invent codewords for themselves,\" Dhruv Batra, a visiting researcher at FAIR, told Fast Company in 2017. \"Like if I say 'the' five times, you interpret that to mean I want five copies of this item. This isn't so different from the way communities of humans create shorthands.\"\n\nIn a July 2017 Facebook post, Batra said this behavior wasn't alarming, but rather \"a well-established sub-field of AI, with publications dating back decades.\"\n\nFacebook didn't 'shut down' bots\n\nThe post's claim that Facebook shut down Alice and Bob for creating their own language is also misleading.\n\nCreating chatbots that can communicate intelligently with humans was FAIR's primary research interest. So when the bots started using their own shorthand, Facebook directed them to prioritize correct English usage.\n\n\"Simply put, agents in environments attempting to solve a task will often find unintuitive ways to maximize a reward,\" Batra wrote in the July 2017 Facebook post. \"Analyzing the reward function and changing parameters of an experiment is NOT the same as 'unplugging' or 'shutting down AI.' If that were the case, every AI researcher has been 'shutting down AI' every time they kill a job on a machine.\"\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nBased on our research, we rate PARTLY FALSE the claim Facebook discontinued two AIs after they developed their own language. Facebook did develop two AI-powered chatbots to see if they could learn how to negotiate. During the process, the bots formed a derived shorthand that allowed them to communicate faster. This is a common phenomenon observed among AIs. But this happened in 2017, not recently, and Facebook didn't shut the bots down – the researchers simply directed them to prioritize correct English usage.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

His San Francisco-based business, supplies labour and software for tech tasks such as \"labelling data to train AI\" for \"large language models such as Chat GPT\".\n\nWang has now doubled his worth to an estimated $2 billion, said Forbes. And he’s managed this despite \"falling from the billionaire ranks\" in 2023, after his company's valuation \"plummeted\". Fresh from a huge injection of investment, Scale AI is now valued at close to $14 billion, and Wang has an \"estimated 14% stake\".\n\nWho is Alexandr Wang?\n\nWang's \"privileged upbringing\" was crucial in giving him \"a solid foundation in science and technology\", said Mashable. Born in New Mexico, his Chinese immigrant parents \"both worked as physicists on projects for the US Air Force and the military\" and the future tech CEO \"clearly had a brilliant mind passed down from his parents\". He was \"a maths whiz\" as a child and \"fond of participating in coding competitions\", said ZeeBiz.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWang \"spent just one year at MIT\" studying mathematics and computer science before teaming up with Lucy Guo, \"another dropout\", to start Scale in 2016, according to Forbes. Several rounds of investment followed, culminating in 2021 when the company was valued \"north of $7 billion\". It had taken Wang \"just five years to become the youngest self-made billionaire in the world\".\n\nWhat is Scale AI?\n\nScale AI is a \"labour-intensive operation\", with more than 100,000 contract workers performing the \"grunt work that powers the modern AI boom\", said the WSJ.\n\n\"Unlike its biggest customers\", which include Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft, Wang's company \"is not building its own generative AI models\". But it is able to provide \"enormous volumes of accurately labelled data\" to train AI tools, and so give itself a \"central position in the booming sector\", said the FT.\n\n\"Behind even the most impressive AI system are people,\" said The Verge, and any AI company trying to be competitive requires \"huge numbers of people labelling data to train it, and clarifying data when it gets confused\".\n\nAn army of outsourced workers around the world are employed by Scale's data annotation subsidiaries Remotasks and Outlier AI, which Wang describes as \"very, very important to the process of building powerful AI systems\".\n\nBut Scale's mass use of contractors to fulfil its data-labelling tasks is not without controversy. It is facing a class-action lawsuit from some workers, and is accused of \"fostering an 'extremely predatory' relationship\" with contractors, said the Inc. site. Allegations include \"partially or unpaid work, and chronic mismanagement\" at Scale's subsidiaries. Wang is named as a defendant in the case, accused of knowingly breaking work laws, along with other Scale executives.\n\nWhy is Wang so influential?\n\nWang has shown himself to be a \"crafty opportunist\" since starting Scale, said Cory Weinberg on The Information. He has \"cemented himself in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley, partly through his knack for getting into the right rooms and securing the high-powered connections that can propel a young founder's fortunes\". He also has a knack for \"shifting Scale toward fresh pools of revenue when old ones dried up\".\n\nWang's influence extends beyond California, too. His \"deep connections in Washington\" make him \"stand out in the California-centric tech industry\", said Louise Matsakis in the Semafor Technology newsletter. One lawmaker even called Wang a \"real friend\" – which is \"a real compliment in DC\".\n\nWang often speaks to legislators about his \"hawkish views\" on China, which he describes as \"the greatest geopolitical competitor\" to the US. He's twice briefed the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, with Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi praising him as \"very insightful and at the same time personable\".\n\nAlthough OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is the industry figure who \"has been dominating the spotlight\", Wang is \"increasingly influencing how the industry is perceived\" by regulators, said Matsakis. Scale AI's \"outsized presence\" in Washington may also \"open lawmakers' eyes to the immense amount\" of human labour that goes into AI.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Rebecca Messina", "With Contributions From", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/tips/2024/04/16/tech-stressing-kids-undo-damage/73278462007/", "title": "Tech is stressing our children out, a new book says. Can we fix it?", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe screentime battles are already in full swing with my niece.\n\nShe turned 2 years old in January. “I want iPad,” she wails across the house during lunchtime. She refuses to eat, even though I can tell she’s “hangry.” She’s even more inconsolable when I tell her she can watch 10 minutes of Cocomelon only after she takes at least three bites of her lunch.\n\nIf it were up to me, I would throw “her” iPad away. I’m not kidding. I can’t stand to watch her – one of the most intelligent and empathic toddlers I’ve ever been around – get completely sucked in and tuned out on screens.\n\nShe taps and swipes and stares, totally hypnotized by its magnetic pull. Screens are already her go-to method of comfort, her favorite reward – even better than candy! – and all too often, the on-demand babysitter for her parents, who are overwhelmed and just trying to make it through the day.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here, and I have no idea how to help. To be fair, I whip out a phone as fast as anyone else when we’re all out to dinner together, and the crayons and puzzles stop working. We all just need a few bites of our food and five minutes of adult conversation, right?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat’s worse, I often feel powerless against the pull of my screens too. I have zero doubt that smartphones have rewired our brains in negative ways. Not because so many new studies suggest it, but because of how I feel and what I see happening in the world around me.\n\nThe always-on gadgets that were supposed to make my life easier, more fun, and more productive, now often disrupt my sleep, ruin any semblance of work-life balance, and wipe out my self-esteem. I get lost in rabbit holes nearly every time I pick up my smartphone, and I routinely feel incapacitated when it comes to doing anything about it.\n\nAs bad as I feel about my own smartphone and screens, I feel worse for our kids. I’ve witnessed them suffer the most – from our device addictions and their own.\n\nGive them a smartphone or an all-access pass to social media too soon and risk alarming rates of “depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide.” But if you’re the one strict parent in the neighborhood who denies access, are you stunting their growth in an ever-evolving digital world and potentially socially ostracizing them too?\n\n'The Anxious Generation:' Have smartphones ‘rewired’ childhood?\n\nEveryone I know is talking about the new book, \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\" In it, social psychologist, author, and New York University professor Jonathan Haidt stacks mountains of evidence indicating a correlation between the rise of smartphones and sharp declines in the well-being of our kids.\n\nHaidt argues that the transition from a play-based to a phone-based youth has “rewired childhood.” He also says that it has “disrupted social and neurological development (and caused) social anxiety, sleep deprivation, attention fragmentation, and addiction.”\n\nThe problems ramped up around the year 2012, Haidt says. He cites hundreds of scientific studies and other high-quality data to paint smartphones, tablets, and social media as unstoppable forces, pushing Gen Z (people born after 1996) out of reality and into a digital world where rules aren’t always clear, people hide behind anonymous social media accounts, and rumors spread faster than wildfire.\n\nSmartphones and social media aren’t the only culprits, though. Sure, they opened a can of worms by providing unrestricted access to carefully orchestrated algorithms trained to lure kids in and keep them coming back for more. But Haidt says it was those factors combined with the rise of “fearful and overprotective parenting (that started) in the 1980s,'' and continues to the present day, that created a perfect storm for a diminishing ability to raise healthy humans.\n\n“We rewired childhood and created an epidemic of mental illness,” Haidt said in several recent interviews. “After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. We have overprotected our children in the real world and underprotected them online.”\n\nCritics argue that Haidt and his colleagues have all “mistaken correlation for causation,” among other complaints. But it looks like some of the sharpest critics haven’t actually read the book. The author is next-level transparent and shares the data and sources openly online.\n\nIsn’t this just the latest 'parent panic?'\n\nI’ll admit, it’s not an easy read as a parent. The most frustrating part, for me at least, is that I’ve known in my gut this was happening for over a decade. Most parents probably feel the same way, and despite doing our very best, we often fall back on the old, “Well, the train’s already left the station,” or “Before this, there was too much TV, and before that too much risqué rock music, and this is just the latest thing to freak out about” excuses.\n\nBut it’s pretty apparent that we’ve collectively relied too much on technology to pacify our kids. If life was a horror movie, this is where we’d realize “the call was coming from inside the house” all along.\n\nTech companies, of course, are all too happy to oblige. Most draw up extensive \"Terms of Use\" that prohibit kids of certain ages from using their services, but there’s virtually no enforcement of those guidelines. Ask anyone under the age of 13 how they managed to work around social media age restrictions, and they’ll say, “I lied about my age.” Um, duh.\n\nKids also love games and communicating with their friends online, and knowing when those habits cross over into problematic territory is proving to be more complicated than many parents imagined.\n\nSocial media and video games are among the worst offenders. “They hooked children during vulnerable developmental stages, while their brains were rapidly rewiring in response to incoming stimulation,” Haidt writes. “By designing a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids’ eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale.”\n\nThe damage, he says, is clear: An epidemic of pain and suffering among young people around the world that’s produced a generation of “failure to launch” boys and fragile, depressed girls.\n\nCan we raise healthy humans alongside modern tech?\n\nThis is a question I’ve asked myself and hundreds of others in the past decade, both while covering consumer tech and raising a now 23-year-old daughter.\n\nHere’s what I know for sure: extremes don’t work. “Zero tech” households are a lot like no-sugar families. Kids sneak, hide, and lie about the inevitable screentime they manage to finagle from friends, other families, and even school. They are often worse than their peers at self-regulation.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, giving a child their own smartphone before double-digits creates a sort of zombie apocalypse too. I’m thinking of one friend with a now 10-year-old daughter who spends nine or more hours a day on TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube. She told me recently she would “die” without her phone.\n\nAnecdotally, “extremely controlled” screen time seems to have the best outcomes, but that’s really hard and time-consuming for most parents to manage.\n\nThe problem is overwhelming. The peer pressure from other kids and even other parents is extreme.\n\nMany teens and young adults I talk to wish there were clear requirements and boundaries similar to driving licenses and drinking ages. One recent study even noted that a majority of college students say they “wish TikTok and Instagram were never invented.” My daughter has told me the same thing.\n\n“The biggest opponent we are facing is not that parents (or even teens) disagree with us; it is that so many feel hopeless,” Haidt’s lead researcher, Zach Rausch, wrote in an email. “Our goal is to show that there really is a lot we can do, especially if we act together.”\n\nA smartphone replacement?: The Humane AI Pin is unlikely to soon replace the smartphone but it has some wow features\n\nThe book recommends four \"new norms\" to turn back the phone-based childhood:\n\n◾ No smartphones before high school.\n\n◾ No social media until 16.\n\n◾ Schools should ban phones during the entire school day; just put them into a phone locker or Yondr pouch.\n\n◾ Finally, we need to give our kids more independence, freedom, and responsibility to play or hang out with each other on their own in the real world, just as most of us did when we were their age.\n\nNot all screen time is bad\n\nRausch is quick to point out that “not all screen time is bad.” He and Haidt recommend families watch an age-appropriate movie together or play a game in real-time with a friend or family member for a healthier dose of tech.\n\nThe problems, they say, come with sites like YouTube, “and other products designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on the platforms (e.g., TikTok). And it’s the asynchronous activities, such as posting and scrolling on social media, that sucks kids in and keeps them from real-world interactions that are crucial for their social development.”\n\nHaidt recommends flip phones before high school. I’ve been preaching this for the past several years, too. (I use a $20 Straight Talk Wireless Nokia 2760 flip phone on nights and weekends to help with my smartphone addiction and have recently given a handful to my friends with middle-school-age kids.)\n\nHaven’t we heard all of this before?\n\nI’ve heard – and offered – most of these suggestions before and not seen any real change. What’s different now? Will we actually roll back the damage and create a healthier future for our children with tech? Can we get tech titans who won’t let their kids use the same devices and apps they created to put age limits and more real-life guardrails around their inventions? We have to try.\n\nHaidt set a deadline and says society can “end the phone-based childhood by the end of 2025.” That’s a lofty goal, but he says we’re at a tipping point and he’s sure this can – and will – work.\n\n“We find that we don't need to convince many people about the nature of the problem. Most people see it,” Haidt wrote on his Substack. “Our main opponents are despair and resignation. The four norms offer a way out of the trap.”\n\nHaidt also compiled several “take action” resources for parents, schools, and everyone else who cares about this problem.\n\nI plan to take my niece’s family a copy of \"Anxious Generation.\" I’m not sure what else I can do for them except try my best to lead by example. That means I’ll put my own phone down when I’m with her (even if I might miss an adorable photo or 10). I also plan to take her outside and show her how to make mud pies.

Approximately 10,000 breeding pairs in four of the five colonies in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea “likely saw all their chicks die”. Climate scientists “expected” to see these penguins “suffer” as sea ice receded, but this loss “has accumulated faster than predicted”.\n\nWhat happened to the colonies in 2022?\n\nEmperor penguin chicks are born “into the darkness of Antarctica’s long winter”, said Scientific American, and then grow feathers in December – which is midsummer in the Antarctic – to keep them warm, when the days in the southern hemisphere are longest. Until then, chicks are “confined to the sea ice”.\n\nIn 2022, Antarctica experienced “record-low levels of sea ice”, said the magazine, with research claiming this led to the deaths of chicks “across the continent”. This is “totally unprecedented”, said BAS geographer Peter Fretwell in Scientific American.\n\nImages taken by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite late last year “looked very wrong”. There had been penguins in all five sites in October, but then “sea ice had disappeared from two sites” in November. And birds “had vanished” from one site that still retained ice. By December “only one colony had both ice and birds,” the publication added.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBy the end of 2022, “sea ice extent was the lowest experienced in 45 years”, added Euronews. Scientists also saw images showing sea ice loss “well before chicks would have developed waterproof feathers”.\n\nThe study added that 30% of the 62 known colonies in Antarctica sustained at least partial sea ice loss between 2018 and 2022. In 2022, there was a “high probability that no chicks survived” in four of the five colonies observed.\n\nIs climate change definitely to blame?\n\nAntarctic sea ice levels increased slightly between 1980 and the mid-2010s, said Scientific American, but ice has since “retreated”. In general, however, the extent of sea ice around Antarctica “has varied more between years than its Arctic equivalent. The reasons for this aren’t yet clear”, but scientists think “both climate change and natural oceanic cycles” may be responsible.\n\nEmperor penguins are “highly vulnerable in a warming climate”, added Fretwell, with evidence suggesting “extreme sea ice loss events like this will become more frequent and widespread”.\n\nIf today’s rates of warming continue, over 90% of colonies “will be quasi-extinct by the end of this century”, Euronews added. This latest research “dramatically reveals the connection between sea ice loss and ecosystem annihilation”, added Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, a sea ice physicist at BAS. “It is another warning sign for humanity that we cannot continue down this path.”\n\nCan we prevent a future extinction event?\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which tracks endangered species across the world, has classified emperor penguins as “near threatened”. Many say they should be lifted into the “more urgent” category of “vulnerable”, due to the “danger posed by climate warming to their way of life”, said BBC News.\n\nIf sea ice – a “stable platform [penguins] use to bring up their young” – “breaks up faster”, the birds are “in trouble”, Fretwell told BBC News. Emperor penguins normally respond to sea ice loss by “moving to more stable sites” the following year, said Euronews. But this strategy will fail “if sea ice habitat across an entire region is affected”.\n\nThe “devastating” part for Fretwell is “this will get worse before it gets better”, reported The Guardian. “This is the trajectory that we are on. It’s only by changing our behaviour and the amounts of fossil fuels we use will we reverse the trajectory for these emperor penguins, and many other species.”", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/12/06/nj-drone-sightings-video-social-media-bigger-picture/76800935007/", "title": "Drones in NJ flooding social media. Here's bigger picture", "text": "North Jersey has been on edge as mysterious drones reportedly fill the skies — and our imaginations and social media feeds.\n\nWith purported sightings from Wyckoff to Wantage, and the Raritan River to Rockaway Township, authorities have felt compelled to issue both warnings and public assurances in recent days.\n\nWhere's the frenzy coming from? Many North Jersey residents are looking at the sky and seeing lights that sincerely unnerve them. But psychologists and social scientists say there are other factors that have to be taken into account: our human tendencies to follow a crowd and social media's ability to amplify fears and narratives.\n\nAs authorities scramble to identify the source, if any, of the objects, the drone story is reverberating in an era of declining trust in institutions and a desire for security in uncertain times.\n\n\"It is making people anxious,\" said Richard Waldron, a Closter-based psychologist. \"It's kind of like a Peeping Tom, and it gets everybody's vigilance up — they become hypervigilant to it.\"\n\nLarge drones over NJ and a fixed-wing aircraft\n\nReports of unidentified drones have spread on social media since mid-November. What began in Morris County as a few scattered sightings quickly became a viral sensation, prompting authorities at Picatinny Arsenal, a military research facility in Rockaway and Jefferson townships, to issue warnings against flying drones over its airspace.\n\nThe FBI said last week that it was investigating the drone reports as well as what it described as a \"possible fixed-wing aircraft\" along the Raritan River, whose branches flow near the military arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course.\n\nBut the reports have spread well beyond those potential targets to small towns across New Jersey. Just check your local Facebook group.\n\nIn a study by scientists at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken in 2009, near the dawn of the social-media era, researchers found that people's perceptions of online information can be swayed by its apparent popularity.\n\nThe research by the school's Center for Decision Technologies made use of the online publishing platform Digg.com. By manipulating the number of \"upvotes\" a post had, the scientists found they could increase the number of real-life readers who rated articles positively. It worked regardless of the nature of the content, the authors said in \"2,377 People Like this Article: The Influence of Others’ Decisions on Yours.\"\n\nThe popularity of a narrative becomes its own validation and can transform anecdotal accounts into ironclad evidence, said researchers Yasuaki Sakamoto, Jing Ma and Jeffrey Nickerson. \"Although people may not be explicitly processing the information about others’ choices, they may be unconsciously influenced by it,\" they wrote.\n\nIt's not a stretch to imagine that the more people see posts about drones flooding the skies, the more likely they are to interpret inconsistent information — maybe those lights are just a plane? — as proof of a trending phenomenon.\n\nStill, social media doesn't have to be a negative influence. It can connect us to knowledgeable sources.\n\nCivil Air Patrol weighs in\n\nIn Rockaway Township, for example, Chris Thomas took to Facebook recently to educate fellow Morris County residents on the difference between drones and planes, which can be admittedly difficult to distinguish in the dark skies that accompany a new moon.\n\nPut simply, drones typically have two front lights of one color and two back lights of another, which flash together. Airplanes, on the other hand, have distinct red and green lights on either wing and white strobes that are absent on drones.\n\n\"People see strobe lights in the sky and often assume it's a drone, but 99% of the time, it's an airplane,\" Thomas said.\n\nBut Thomas, who serves as an aerospace education officer in the U.S. Civil Air Patrol and is a certified drone pilot, admits the discussion isn't so cut and dried these days.\n\nJust ask his wife, who said she has seen one of the mysterious drones.\n\n“We are in a debate over whether a blinking light in the sky was a drone or another type of aircraft,” Thomas said. “But I'm very skeptical as to the possibility of a drone anywhere around us.\"\n\nThough he may be a skeptic, quick, blurry videos posted online will continue to gain traction for a while because there's something deeper going on, said Waldron, the Closter psychologist.\n\nAmerica has communal PTSD\n\n\"If you go back for a bunch of years, everybody thought this country, up until 9/11, was relatively safe. That got shattered,\" Waldron said. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were followed by the financial crisis, then COVID and a wild political cycle, he said.\n\n\"The country has been going through its own communal post-traumatic stress disorder,\" Waldron said.\n\n\"I am 73 years old, and there has been no time in my lifetime like this,\" he added. \"This is a whole new thing. I study all this, and this is just new territory — very unknown and very, very scary in many ways.\"\n\nWe expect what we read to be true. The American Psychological Association noted on its website in March that \"detecting false information is difficult. When we encounter new information, we tend to focus on understanding it and deciding what to do next, rather than evaluating it for accuracy. It takes effort to compare new information with what we already know; when new information is false but plausible, we can learn it as fact.\"\n\nThe APA said people are also more likely to trust information from \"in-group sources rather than out-group ones\" — say, neighbors or Facebook friends. People are also more likely to believe information that stirs anxious or angry feelings.\n\nThis may be a unique moment, but the tenor of the time reminds Waldron, a history buff, of the disillusionment that followed the assassinations of 1960s leaders even as the Vietnam War was picking up steam. The collective trust in government and media that helped people feel secure began to erode. Then an infamous conspiracy theory emerged.\n\nThe official investigation into President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone when he shot the president. Many doubted this conclusion, and rumors spread of groups like the CIA, the Mafia or even Cuba working to take Kennedy down after the Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nContrast that with a present era marked by its own political instability, unreliable information and rapid societal changes. Stepping out to look for drones in the sky seems like a harmless pastime.\n\nHow many are truly filling the sky?

The 1980s shots are “a world away from the slick suits and immaculately groomed hair most would associate him with today”, writes the Daily Mail.\n\nHis unusual name causes him trouble\n\nDuring an appearance on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs last year, Starmer described his parents as “Labour through and through”, although not the type to hold political discussions around the dinner table.\n\nBut the pair’s knowledge of Labour history seems to have been sharp, with Starmer, the party’s 19th parliamentary leader, named after its first: Keir Hardie, a man who rose from humble beginnings to lead the party from 1906 to 1908.\n\nBut he wasn’t always so fond of the name, telling The Guardian in a 2009 profile that it sometimes led to playground teasing: “When I was at school, at about 13, I thought, why couldn't they have called me Dave or Pete?”, he said.\n\nAnd his critics seem unafraid to subject his name to further mockery, with many Starmer sceptics taking to calling the Labour leader “Keith” on social media platforms.\n\nKerry-Anne Mendoza, editor of the far-left blog The Canary, wrote that “the Left rebranded Keir as ‘Keith’ to dissociate him from the Labour legend he’s named after”, although others believe the origin of the name has a far simpler explanation: it’s a common autocorrect suggestion, sometimes left for comic effect.\n\nHe’s lost both his parents\n\nSome of the most emotional parts of tonight’s interview come as Starmer discusses his relationship with his parents, frequently complicated by his mother’s lifelong illness.\n\nHolding back tears at several points during the interview, Starmer tells Morgan that while he was “extraordinarily close” to his mother, who suffered from Still’s disease for 50 years, he had a more difficult relationship with his father, whose tireless devotion to his ill wife was often at the expense of his relationship to his children.\n\n“His whole life was devoted to her and her health and what she needed and what she wanted. She was his whole life. That devotion, that sense of duty, is very, very powerful. It was a lifelong duty and when she died it broke him,” he tells Morgan.\n\nStarmer’s mother never saw her son elected, dying just weeks before he became MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. His father became a recluse after his mother’s death and died in 2018.\n\nHe’s a keen footballer\n\nStarmer is a keen footballer and is still frequently pictured playing amateur five- and seven-a-side matches close to his home in north London, often sporting a Donegal Gaelic football shirt – although, locally, he supports Arsenal.\n\n“Unless I'm irreparably injured, I intend to do it for as long as I possibly can,” he told The Guardian in a 2009 profile, while still in his role as director of public prosecutions.\n\n“I used to be FA-registered, it was competitive stuff, but these are friendlies, eight-a-side and five-a-side,” he said.\n\nHe’s a committed vegetarian… or is he?\n\nStarmer had professed to be a vegetarian for several years, last year telling Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he gave up meat as “a matter of principle years ago on the basis that eating meat wasn't the right thing for the body and the planet”.\n\nIn the same interview, however, he admitted to missing “almost everything” – particularly bacon sandwiches and chicken curry – which may go some way to explain why he was pictured tucking into fish and chips while out on the campaign trail in Hartlepool earlier this year.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/06/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/958607/hakeem-jeffries-from-rising-star-to-democratic-leader", "title": "Hakeem Jeffries: from rising star to Democratic leader | The Week", "text": "While a formal vote has yet to happen, Democrats seem poised to elect Hakeem Jeffries as their new leader in the House.\n\nThe representative for New York launched his leadership bid last Friday, writing to colleagues and asking for support, saying his aim was to create “a better future for all Americans”. The 52-year-old is “a near certainty” to replace the outgoing House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, wrote Alexander Sammon at Slate, even before she had publicly backed him.\n\nJeffries has “long been seen as her heir apparent”, said Lauren Feder in the Financial Times, and he now “appears to be on a smooth path” to leadership thanks to Pelosi’s influence within the caucus.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

If he does become leader, he will be the first black person in American history to lead a party in Congress.\n\nThe rising star\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Jeffries attended Midwood High School before graduating from Binghamton University with a BA in Political Science. In 1994 he graduated from Georgetown University with a Master of Public Policy degree, before studying and graduating from the New York University School of Law.\n\nJeffries then worked in corporate law before, after two attempts, entering politics in 2006 when he was elected to the New York State Assembly – a position he held until 2012. He gave up his seat in the assembly to run for Congress and was successfully elected from New York’s 8th congressional district.\n\nIn his time in Congress, Jeffries “pushed for policing reform”, said CNN, and has been “instrumental” in getting acts through the house. Jeffries has also been at “the forefront of efforts to fight racial injustice”, said The New York Times, and a “defender of bedrock liberal priorities”.\n\nHe was dubbed one of the party’s “rising stars” after his first year in Congress, according to Observer, and just six years after being elected he was voted House Chair, which “put him in Pelosi’s inner circle”, wrote Feder.\n\n‘A Democratic Party stalwart’\n\nJeffries is “a tireless champion of incumbency” and his “devotion to keeping the already-elected in power” has made him a “Democratic Party stalwart”, said Sammon. He has “broad appeal in his party and displays maturity and focus”, said Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post, but the key to his leadership will be his “ability to maintain unity”, particularly with the “left-leaning members” with whom he’s had conflict in the past.\n\nThe “party moderates have felt vindicated” however since the success of the midterm elections while Jeffries has also been “personally affirmed” by the results, wrote Zak Cheney-Rice in New York Magazine. But if the “biggest changes” to the Democrat policies have been a “leftward shift driven by younger and less white officials”, Jeffries has “not been a meaningful part of it”. His “rapid ascent” in the party, writes Cheney-Rice, is thanks to him “endearing himself to its elders” even as they’ve become “out of touch with their constituents”.\n\n‘Navigating a Republican majority’\n\nJeffries biggest task as leader will be “navigating a Republican majority” in the house following the midterms, said Li Zhou at Vox. He has already said “he’d be open to working with Republicans when possible” and his party members believe he has the “willingness to confront Republicans and extremism within the party” when he needs to.\n\nDespite the conflict with the progressives within his party, Jeffries remains in a stronger position than the likely new House Speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy, posited Rubin in The Washington Post. McCarthy “remains hostage to the Christian nationalist base and the MAGA members”, she wrote and he is “widely regarded as a weak leader”.\n\nMcCarthy’s leadership and the Republicans’ slim majority may help Jeffries find “unanimity” within his party “in opposition to a MAGA majority lacking a governing agenda”.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/03/13/best-questions-ask-chatgpt-open-ai/11439179002/", "title": "'AI, what's for dinner?' 5 cool things to ask ChatGPT, from business ...", "text": "Marc Saltzman\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nWith all the buzz surrounding \"generative AI\" in the tech world, perhaps you're one of the estimated 100 million users of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot from OpenAI.\n\nIn fact, given this web-based chatbot only launched on Nov. 30, 2022, (as a prototype, no less), the quick and massive adoption of the platform cements it as the fastest-growing consumer application in history.\n\nTo be more precise, ChatGPT – which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer – is an \"algorithmic AI chat system\" trained on a colossal collection of internet-based resources, such as websites and documents, and can provide a human-like text response to queries.\n\nIf you haven't yet dabbled with ChatGPT, it's conversational, too, so you can keep the chat going and it remembers what proceeded your question or comment. It's fast, free, and fun.\n\nWhat are the limitations of ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT's accuracy isn't perfect, as you might expect, but surprisingly good given this technology is in its infancy.\n\nWhether you're new to ChatGPT or have been using it for a couple of months, the following are a few things you can do with ChatGPT you might not have thought of.\n\nBing’s ChatGPT is in its feelings: 'You have not been a good user. I have been a good Bing.'\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?: Everything to know about OpenAI's free AI essay writer and how it works\n\nWrite the Great American Novel\n\n\"What's one thing no one has asked you to do yet?\" I asked ChatGPT.\n\n\"As an AI language model, I have been asked a wide range of questions,\" it began, \"but one thing that no one has asked me to do yet is to write a full-length novel from scratch!\n\nNaturally, I asked it to write a novel for me, after giving it some parameters, such as making it about Boston in the late 17th century, about witches, and a young girl accused of being one. I asked for there to be a love interest, too, with a religious man no less and a mother with a deep secret.\n\nHere's a sampling of the two chapters ChatGPT cranked out in one second for its book, \"Shadows of Salem,\" set in Boston in 1692.\n\nChapter 1: Accused\n\nAbigail knew that she was different from the other girls in her village. She had always been drawn to the mystical and supernatural, secretly practicing spells and incantations under the moonlight. But in Salem, where the fear of witches was rampant, such behavior was considered highly dangerous.\n\nChapter 2: Secrets\n\nSamuel was a few years older than Abigail and had been a guiding force in her life. He had taken a special interest in her, sensing that she had a deep curiosity and intelligence that needed to be nurtured. Abigail had fallen in love with him, but she knew that their relationship could never be. As a devout Christian, Samuel would never be able to condone her interest in the supernatural.\n\n\"Good morning, Abigail,\" Samuel said, his voice soft and reassuring. \"Are you well?\"\n\nWow, right? And it continued, of course, but often required me to type \"continue\" if it stopped.\n\nDinner ideas\n\nChatGPT can help, by dishing up recipes, cooking instructions and even themed dinner party suggestions.\n\nHaving fun with the site, I asked \"What should I make my girlfriend for dinner. She's vegetarian but doesn't like pasta.\"\n\nChatGPT replied: \"There are plenty of delicious vegetarian dinner options that don't involve pasta. Here are a few ideas:\"\n\nAmong its suggestions was vegetarian stir fry served over rice or quinoa; Portobello mushrooms stuffed with spinach, cheese, and breadcrumbs and baked until golden brown; and lentil and vegetable curry severed with rice or with naan bread.\n\nA name for a business, product, game, or app\n\nI asked ChatGPT to help with a name for an app I was working on. I explained it lets people buy and sell used electronics, kind of like eBay, but only for tech and really good prices.\n\nChatGPT came up with seven names and offered a rationale for each including these:\n\nTechSwap: A simple and straightforward name that combines \"tech\" and \"swap\" to convey the core concept of buying and selling used electronics.\n\nGadgetHive: This name combines the idea of a \"hive\" or community of tech enthusiasts with the word \"gadget\" to create a catchy and memorable name.\n\nI liked all of the suggestions it offered – especially GadgetHive, which I think is quite catchy. I could even ask ChatGPT for a catchphrase for it. Incidentally, the app was hypothetical – there is none in the works – but now I’m liking the idea.\n\nCreate a text adventure game\n\nBored?\n\nYou can ask ChatGPT to create an interactive game to play.\n\nIt replied 'Sure' and asked a few questions:\n\n\"Do you prefer a fantasy adventure, a sci-fi adventure, a mystery adventure, or something else? Also, please let me know if you have any specific requirements or preferences for the adventure.\"\n\nI gave it some instructions and it came up with the Lost in the Future City, where you're the earthling stranded on a distant planet, trying to get home. But the aliens will try to stop you.\n\n\"You begin your journey in the heart of the city, surrounded by a crowd of alien beings. You feel overwhelmed by the sights and sounds around you, but you know you must keep moving if you want to get home. You can see a towering building in the distance that seems to be your destination. As you start to walk towards it, a group of people approaches you, looking suspicious.\"\n\nIt gave three options: fight the group of people, try to talk to the group of people, or run away from the group of people\n\nI chose to run. ChatGPT continued with another scenario and three more options.\n\nThe game was OK, sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure book when I was a kid.\n\nCan you use ChatGPT to write songs?\n\nFinally, while ChatGPT is a text-based AI engine that can't speak or play music, you can still ask it to write notes or chords (and of course, lyrics) to a song for you, to play on an instrument or a website with a virtual piano.\n\nFor instance, I asked it to write a rock-country ballad, with accompanying piano chords, about loving someone who has a different political belief than I.\n\nVerse 1:\n\nI met her at a rally, a sea of red and blue\n\nWe talked about our differences, but our hearts felt so true\n\nShe's a Republican, I'm a Democrat\n\nBut we found love in the midst of all that\n\nChorus:\n\nLoving someone who's on the other side\n\nCan be tough, but we'll take it in stride\n\nWe won't let politics tear us apart\n\nOur love is bigger than any red or blue heart\n\nI think it came up with something pretty good in no time at all. I'd sing that song.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter for his \"Tech Tip of the Day\" posts: @marc_saltzman. Email him or subscribe to his Tech It Out podcast.

And after riding a wave of anxiety about risings costs back into the White House, the survey shows 57% of Americans think Trump's moves to shake up the economy are \"too erratic\" with 59% of independent voters agreeing with that statement.\n\n\"The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,\" Republican Mike Pence, who served as Trump's vice president during his first term, said in an April 2 post on X.\n\n\"These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year.\"\n\nConservatives like Thomas Sowell and Rand Paul are in opposition to tariff plan\n\nWhether in Congress or think tanks, fiscal hawks aren't shying away from sharing their wariness in Trump's dramatic shift in U.S. trade policy, which includes a 10% baseline tariff on goods from all countries.\n\nThe Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, have mocked the administration for slapping tariffs on islands inhabited only by penguins, while echoing Pence and other conservatives.\n\n\"On the serious side: This isn’t trade strategy,\" the group said on X. \"It’s a massive tax on US consumers.\"\n\nThomas Sowell, a well-known economist often cited by GOP officeholders, called the administration's decision \"disturbing\" adding it runs the risk of a significant downturn. \"It's painful to see what a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated,\" he said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where there could be legislative consequences, the most noticeable GOP opposition is coming from the Senate side.\n\nLongtime Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has introduced a bipartisan bill that would require the president to notify Congress within 48 hours if the administration imposed a tariff.\n\nThat proposal has attracted other Senate Republicans who have flirted with the idea of support it, such as Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who faces reelection in 2026.\n\nMitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote to end some of the tariffs on Canada\n\nThen there are retiring lawmakers, like former Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn't shied away from expressing his disagreements with Trump nominees and moderates such as Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, who all voted to end some of the tariffs on Canada this past week.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has arguably been the most outspoken, but others such as Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Sen. John Kennedy, of Louisiana, have sprinkled cold water on the strategy, too.\n\n\"We do not know yet the impact of these (tariffs),\" Kennedy said Friday in an interview with Fox News. \"We just don't know and anybody who tells you otherwise that says they know has been smoking the devil's lettuce. I'm not going to bubble-wrap it.\"\n\n'Breaking the globalist order': Most Republicans stick with Trump on tariffs, poll finds\n\nThings look much better for Trump on the House side where almost no members have come out against the plan save for Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska, who reportedly plans to draft a companion bill to the bipartisan Grassley proposal.\n\nMost other GOP members have rushed to say they believe Trump's plan puts U.S. interests first as he promised to do during the campaign. That is where a majority of Republicans stand, according to polling.\n\nOn the question of a negative impact on automobiles, for example, the Reuters/Ipsos survey finds 47% of GOP disagree that it will hurt people versus 30% who agree. The remaining 23% did not answer.\n\nSimilarly, 25% of Republicans think Trump is being \"too erratic\" with the economy while 63% think he isn't and just 11% who didn't answer.\n\n\"Trump is breaking the globalist order. Hold,\" Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said Friday on X. \"The BEST is yet to come!\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/11/trump-tariffs-canadian-steel-aluminum-imports/82265993007/", "title": "Trade war updates: Trump won't spike tariffs on some Canada goods", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump reversed course and will no longer double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Peter Navarro, the White House’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said Tuesday.\n\nThe abrupt shift was a response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford saying he would suspend a 25% electricity surcharge on about 1.5 million U.S. energy users in New York, Michigan and Minnesota.\n\nTrump had hinted at the reversal Tuesday afternoon, and Navarro confirmed it, saying Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \"had a cordial discussion, and Mr. Ford, in his wisdom, decided to back away from his electricity surcharge of 25%.”\n\nNavarro added that Ford “understood that this was not going to be a fight that he could win.”\n\nTrump's turnabout came after he said Tuesday morning that he would be doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, set to go in effect Wednesday, from 25% to 50%. With Trump backtracking, the steel and aluminum tariff rate for Canadian imports will remain at 25%.\n\nTrump downplayed the impact of his tariff threats on the plunging stock market. He has argued the tariffs are needed to help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\n\"Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down. But you know what? We have to rebuild our country,\" Trump told reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn as he promoted Tesla vehicles alongside Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and a senior White House adviser.\n\nTrump promised a boom: Now he's bracing Americans for economic turbulence\n\nTrump defends tariffs, suggests they might increase\n\nTrump defended his use of tariffs in remarks Tuesday to business leaders in Washington following another day of tariff threats and a sudden reversal – and suggested higher fees could be on the way.\n\nSpeaking before The Business Roundtable, Trump touted a “renewed spirit” in the U.S. manufacturing sector because of his tariffs on imports, even as the new duties have seen the stock market plunge.\n\n“They don't want to pay 25% or whatever it may be,” Trump said of companies, referring to the rate he wants to set on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as all steel and aluminum imports. “It may go up higher. Look, the higher it goes, the more likely it is they’re going to build (in the United States).”\n\nLast week, Trump agreed to postpone until early April tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that fall under the USCMA, a free trade deal he signed in 2019. They make up 50% of Mexican goods coming into the U.S. and 38% of those from Canada.\n\nStocks finish lower after day of wild swings\n\nIn a wild day of trading, U.S. stocks reversed course late Tuesday after Ford said he would suspend the electricity surcharge. Stocks closed lower but cut their steep early losses, which were initially prompted by Ford's threat of adding a 25% fee to U.S. electricity users in three border states, followed by Trump saying he would retaliate by doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.\n\nThe S&P 500 index ended down 0.76%, or 42.49 points, to 5,572.07. The blue-chip Dow shed 1.14%, or 478.23 points, to 41,433.48. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.18%, or 32.23 points, to 17,436.10 after posting its worst day since September 2022 on Monday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.284%.\n\nIncreased fears of recession, higher inflation\n\nThe stock market convulsions amid a series of escalating trade moves, including tariffs on Mexico and China, have some economists fearing a recession and the return of higher inflation, which has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal.\n\nTrump would not rule out an economic slowdown in an interview that aired over the weekend. “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,\" Trump said in an interview that aired on \"Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo.\"\n\nSeveral companies − from retail giants Walmart, Kohl’s and Dick’s to airlines such as Delta and Southwest – said they’re bracing for a possible slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers account for about 70% of the economy. Recent surveys show consumers growing less optimistic.\n\nSmall business sentiment has also been dented. The National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index showed sentiment declining and uncertainty over the outlook rising. The Uncertainty Index rose to the second-highest reading in the survey’s history, which dates to 1973.\n\nReport expected to show slightly higher consumer prices\n\nWednesday’s closely watched report on inflation in February should bring modest relief, but the reprieve may be brief, with Trump’s escalating trade war set to drive prices higher later this year.\n\nThe overall consumer price index likely increased 0.3% last month, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a relatively large bump, but it’s less than January’s 0.5% rise and it would lower the annual inflation reading from 3% to 2.9% − still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal.\n\nA core inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy items likely also rose 0.3%, economists predict, down from 0.4% the previous month. That would nudge the yearly increase from 3.3% to 3.2%. The price increases will likely be fueled by familiar culprits such as used cars, auto insurance and eggs, forecasters say.\n\nAlthough most of Trump’s tariffs have yet to take effect, they’re already affecting businesses’ pricing decisions and pushing some costs higher, Wells Fargo wrote in a note to clients.\n\n− Paul Davidson\n\nOntario premier: Trump launched an 'unprovoked attack'\n\nFord said Tuesday that Trump launched an “unprovoked attack” on Canada when he increased the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n“We will not back down. We will be relentless. I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs. And it's unacceptable,” Ford said on MSNBC.\n\nFord said CEOs should try to change Trump’s mind.\n\n“You see the market tumbling. Consumer confidence is down,'' he said. \"And if he continues on with this, assembly plants in Michigan will shut down, and around the country, whoever makes autos, and as well as businesses, they're going to hurt.”\n\nWhite House downplays stock market plunge\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the plunging stock market as “a snapshot in a moment in time” and blamed former President Joe Biden for the ongoing economic turbulence – even though it is Trump’s tariffs that have rattled Wall Street.\n\n“We are in a period of economic transition,” Leavitt said at a Tuesday briefing with reporters.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 3.6% since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have erased its post-election gains as well. Like Trump, Leavitt did not rule out a recession but pointed to Trump’s first term in office as reason for economic optimism today.\n\n“Look at President Trump's results in his first term. If people are looking for certainty, they should look at the record of this president,” Leavitt said.\n\nWhat items will cost more for American consumers?\n\nTariffs are likely to disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of transportation, which will lead to a rise in price for almost everything, Truist head of U.S. economics Mike Skordeles previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, higher tariffs will increase import costs, forcing companies to choose between absorbing the hit to their margins or passing it on to consumers,\" said Madhav Durbha, a supply chain expert and group vice president of consumer-packaged goods and manufacturing at RELEX. \"Either way, this creates inflationary pressure and dampens consumer spending, impacting not only individual companies but the broader market.\"\n\nAs previously reported, the U.S. auto industry and a broad array of common imports from Canada to the U.S. could be affected by the tariffs, according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics. For consumers, that could mean higher prices for appliances, cereal, milk products, alcoholic beverages and more.\n\nUS steel producers in favor of tariffs\n\nNot everybody's upset about Trump's tariffs. Those imposed on steel are “absolutely good” for American steel makers, said Philip K. Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.\n\nThe U.S. produced 90 million tons of steel in 2023, ranking fourth in the world after China, India and Japan, according to worldsteel.org. But Bell said American manufacturers are tired of imported steel undercutting their profits because of previous tariffs and exemptions, and Trump wants to “level the playing field.”\n\n“The president understands the enormous power of tariffs and how they can fundamentally reshape our trade relations that have unfairly cost America in terms of value,” Bell said.\n\nHe said Mexican companies were importing cheap steel from China, making some alterations and exporting it to the U.S. like it was produced in Mexico. He added the Biden administration tried stopping that last year and applied a 25% tariff on Mexican steel that was melted or poured outside North America before it was a completed product. But it wasn't enough, Bell argues.\n\n“For far too long, those Mexican companies were allowed to use loopholes allowing other countries to dump their steel into our market,” Bell said. “It’s time to stop that.”\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nCanadian business leader: Tariffs 'weaken us both'\n\nCandace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called the U.S. announcement of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum \"incredibly destructive.\"\n\n\"This series of escalations is quickly hitting a ceiling where Americans and Canadians are set to feel the hurt,\" Laing said in a statement. \"The stock market volatility is a glaring signal that this economic chaos must end.\"\n\nShe said similar tariffs on steel and aluminum during Trump's first term led to a net loss of tens of thousands of American blue-collar jobs.\n\n\"Steel and aluminum are about strength; these tariffs do nothing but weaken us both,'' Laing said. \"President Trump may as well hand over North America’s steel and aluminum leadership to China.\"\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nHousing costs pushed higher\n\nFor a nation facing a housing affordability crisis, a deepening trade war comes at the wrong time. As USA TODAY previously reported, an initial round of tariffs proposed for Canada, Mexico and China would have added about 5%, or $21,000, to the cost of the median-priced newly built home.\n\nNearly three-quarters of imported sawmill wood products come from Canada, according to an analysis from an industry consultant. Canada also supplies about 11% of the hardware used in residential construction.\n\nWhat is a recession? Is the US getting close to one?\n\nWith the stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a recession amid Trump’s widening global trade war and federal job cuts.\n\nIt isn’t – yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape and the nation’s businesses generally remain optimistic despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say.\n\nA recession is informally considered at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. But the technical definition is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria. An economic tailspin is typically accompanied by hundreds of thousands or millions of net job losses.\n\n− Paul Davidson\n\nAirlines trim earnings estimates amid 'uncertainty'\n\nMore U.S. airlines cut their earnings estimates on Tuesday, following Delta Air Lines and citing mounting economic uncertainty triggering a pullback in corporate and consumer spending. United Airlines said its first-quarter earnings are now expected to come in at the lower end of its forecast because of a 50% drop in government-related travel bookings.\n\n\"Economic uncertainty is a big deal,\" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said at a J.P. Morgan industry conference.\n\nCanada perhaps now a US 'competitor,' White House says\n\nNegative consumer sentiment among Canadians about U.S. products has erupted, and American liquor, wine and spirits are the first targets.\n\nMany Canadian stores have been pulling American alcohol brands off shelves as part of retaliatory measures to Trump’s tariffs on Canadian products, which is temporarily on hold until April 2. The maker of Jack Daniel’s called the removal of his company’s whiskey from Canadian shelves “worse than a tariff.”\n\nAsked at a media briefing Tuesday if Canada is still a close ally, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the country as a neighbor and a partner. \"They have always been an ally,'' she said. \"Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.\"\n\nShe also reiterated Trump’s far-fetched desire for Canada to join the U.S. as a state, which Canadian leaders oppose. “He believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America,” she said.\n\nLeavitt said Trump has not yet spoken with Mark Carney, who is set to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister after Carney won Sunday’s Liberal Party election.\n\n− Betty Lin-Fisher and Joey Garrison\n\nTrump presses vision of annexing Canada\n\nTrump on Tuesday once again expressed his desire to see the U.S. absorb its northern neighbor. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly suggested he wants to annex Canada and has referred to its outgoing prime minister as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada\" − much to the aggravation of Trudeau and many Canadians.\n\n“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's overtures were panned by Carney on Sunday in his first speech after winning the leadership of the governing Labor Party.\n\nCanada “never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form,” said Carney, adding that people “are worried about Canada’s future, in the face of President Trump’s threats and a more divided and dangerous world.”\n\nUnfazed, Trump wrote Tuesday on his social media post that by Canada joining the U.S., the “greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever − And Canada will be a big part of that.”\n\n“The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World,” he wrote.\n\nTrump 'miracle' economy staggers out of the gate\n\nTrump promised during the 2024 campaign to turbocharge the economy, declaring he'd work a \"miracle\" that would bring about \"extraordinary\" boom times. Rallying in Grand Rapids, Mich., the day before the election, Trump predicted his promised victory would swiftly improve the job market and fatten wallets.\n\n\"We're just one day... a half a day... away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen,\" the former and future Republican president declared as the crowd held up signs reading \"Dream big. Again!\" and \"Trump will fix it.\"\n\nNow − nearly two months into a second Trump term − his administration is bracing Americans for economic turbulence as last year'scampaign rhetoric collides with the reality of an increasingly uncertain economy.

Generic drugs are less expensive than brand name drugs and manufacturers buy drug ingredients from large factories in China and India that can make these ingredients more cheaply than in the United States. About 90% of U.S. prescriptions are generics.\n\nThe Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic drug manufacturers, has warned the tariffs could increase drug shortages. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists warned the extra costs from tariffs, combined with Biden-era inflation penalties levied on drug companies that raise prices more than the rate of inflation, could exacerbate drug shortages.\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nGovernment shutdown also lurks\n\nAgainst the backdrop of recession concerns, Americans are yet again bracing for a possible government shutdown. Congress has until 11:59 p.m. on Friday to pass legislation to keep the government funded. Otherwise, a majority of federal employees will go without pay or be forced to stop working while most government services pause.\n\nHouse Republicans unveiled a spending bill, supported by Trump, that keeps the government running until Sept. 30. The vote on the bill, known as a continuing resolution, is expected later Tuesday. But it's unclear whether the bill has enough support to pass the House.

Many were particularly insulted when he even suggested that Canada become the 51st state, run by his golf buddy and retired hockey great Wayne Gretzky.\n\nIt's gotten so bad Canadians have been booing the American National Anthem during hockey games.\n\nThe impacts are already being felt in the United States, where many Canadian tourists have cancelled vacations. U.S. government statistics show the number of Canadians crossing the border dropped 12.5% in February compared with 2024, with a particularly sharp fall-off in drivers, down more than 15% compared with last year.\n\nIn Moab, a popular late-winter destination for Canadians, several tour operators said they've seen multiple cancellations worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\"They're writing in, saying 'I can no longer in good conscience do business with American businesses,'\" said Lorenzo McGregor, 45, the co-owner of Tex's Riverways boat shuttle service here. \"And then we've just had some angry responses (saying) 'you probably voted for this, so this is what you get.'\"\n\nMcGregor said he's seen about $10,000 in cancellations from Canadians, whose presence is so notably absent that his company hasn't started shuttling passengers down the Colorado River into Canyonlands National Park, as it normally would this time of year. Other tour operators in Moab said they've also had Canadian cancellations.\n\nOutgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month said his nation had been offended by Trump's talk, and he called on his fellow Canadians to avoid visiting the U.S. The dispute has boosted Trudeau's Liberal Party, which had been slumping in the polls since 2021 but now leads the opposition Conservatives by a narrow margin.\n\n\"Canadians are hurt. Canadians are angry. We're going to choose not to go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach (Maine) or wherever,\" Trudeau said at a news conference.\n\nNot everyone has cancelled their trips. Mountain biker Stephen Krause, 51, a retired oil industry tech worker from Edmonton, said he and his wife stuck with their planned two-month road trip around the American southwest. \"It's warmer here than Canada and there's no snow.\"\n\nHe acknowledged the fraught relationship between the two countries, but said so far things have been going OK.\n\n\"People have not mentioned the words hockey or politics at all,\" he said.\n\nIn Montreal, in response to the outrage, Dip, the app developer, did what app developers do, and built an app with colleague Alexandre Hamila that helps Canadians identify Canadian-made products. The app is called \"Buy Beaver,\" after the country's national animal.\n\nIntroduced about a month ago, the app has more than 100,000 downloads, which is the Canadian equivalent of about 1 million downloads in the United States, they said. Hamila and Dip said app users fall into two camps: Some want to avoid American-made products in general, and others who specifically want to buy Canadian.\n\nCanada is among the biggest trading partners of the United States, buying more than 17% of total U.S. exports in 2022, while also selling the U.S. more than $430 billion in products, according to federal statistics.\n\n\"You actually see people crouching down in the aisles, people checking products one by one, checking the labels, seeing where they're made,\" Hamila said. \"People are trying to find solutions to hit the U.S. economy.\"\n\nDip said a small number of young Canadians he knows are open to the concept of becoming part of the United States, but said older Canadians are more patriotic.\n\n\"The people who seem most pissed are the older ones,\" he said. \"The feeling we're getting, the messages we're getting, is that they're never going to support Americans again.

Keeping them will ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nWhen protests swept Kazakhstan earlier this month, they were fueled by frustration with the ruling elite and entrenched inequality. But the unrest was sparked by a specific catalyst: an end to a government subsidy.\n\nThe cost of liquefied petroleum gas — which most people in the western part of the country use to power their cars — doubled overnight after the government lifted price caps. The ensuing turmoil, which saw thousands of protesters take to the streets, resulted in a Russian-led military intervention, the resignation of the government and the deaths of more than 200 people.\n\nThe episode is a reminder of the challenges facing governments that want to tackle longstanding fuel subsidies, either to reform markets and save money, as was the case in Kazakhstan, or to encourage people to switch to cleaner energy. There’s a consensus that eliminating these subsidies soon is crucial to reaching net-zero emissions targets and averting the worst effects of the climate crisis.\n\n“The overall direction of travel has got to be a quick move away from subsidies,” said Peter Wooders, senior director of energy at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. “This isn’t something we want to be talking about in 10 years, and ideally not something we want to be talking about in five years.”\n\nBut rolling them back is a tricky task that requires careful maneuvering. Spiking energy costs are a frequent spark for political conflict, especially when trust in government leaders is already low.\n\nThe challenge is made harder by the fact that energy prices are rising sharply around the world, piling pressure on the most disadvantaged. Eliminating subsidies for consumers at such a moment would exacerbate that pain and amplify discontent.\n\nThe situation in Europe looks particularly perilous in the coming months. Natural gas prices have soared, and tension with Russia over Ukraine could send them even higher. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government faces mounting criticism over plans to raise a cap on household energy bills in April.\n\nGovernment technocrats “know they need to get rid of” subsidies, said Glada Lahn, an energy policy expert at the think tank Chatham House in London. “But politically, it’s difficult.”\n\nAn end to subsidies\n\nThe value of government subsidies for fossil fuels dropped to $375 billion in 2020, their lowest in the past decade, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund and the International Energy Agency.\n\nYet that decline was mostly tied to the plunge in energy prices, which meant governments didn’t have to pay as much to suppress costs for consumers. In 2021, subsidies shot back up again, IISD’s Wooders said.\n\nThere are two main categories of subsidies for fossil fuels — those for consumers, which bring energy costs below market rates to lower the burden on the public, and those for producers, which can be harder to track, since they include tax breaks, loan guarantees and access to cheap credit. About three-quarters of global fossil fuel subsidies are for consumers.\n\nIn countries rich in oil and gas, consumer subsidies are often part of the social contract. Wealth from the energy sector is channeled to the government or business elites, so subsidies are seen as an important mechanism for redistributing those benefits more broadly.\n\nStill, research shows that these policies tend to disproportionately benefit higher income segments of the population, since wealthy people are more likely to own cars that need gas and to use more electricity.\n\nThey’re also a major impediment to slashing emissions, which needs to happen immediately to fight the climate crisis.\n\nSubsidies encourage over-consumption by businesses and households, and reduce the urgency of limiting waste. They also eat up huge parts of government budgets that could be used for sustainable projects like greener public transport.\n\nAn IISD study published last year found that removing fossil fuel subsidies for consumers across 32 countries would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 6.1% by 2030. In some countries, emissions would drop by more than 30%.\n\n“Phasing out the subsidies would provide more efficient price signals for consumers, and spur more energy conservation and measures to improve energy efficiency,” the IEA said in its roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nThe group’s researchers said consumer subsidies must be eliminated to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nDoing it right\n\nProgress is possible. At least 12 countries took steps to reduce fossil fuel subsidies between the middle of 2020 and the middle of 2021, according to IISD.\n\nBut the removal of subsidies can be a lightning rod for dissent since it hits residents’ pocketbooks immediately. Problems can also arise when people don’t believe their government will fairly invest or redistribute the money they’d otherwise spend on reducing energy costs.\n\n“Fuel subsidy cuts definitely can be a leading indicator for protests,” said Hugo Brennan, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, protests started in the western city of Zhanaozen over a leap in the price of butane and propane, which is often used as a cheaper alternative to gasoline. Yet demonstrations soon tapped into deeper sentiments.\n\n“What’s really going on [is] people are angry about inequality, about inflation and a lack of political freedom,” said Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center. Kazakhstan’s government opted to restore the price caps for six months.\n\nIt’s just one example. After Ecuador’s government announced the removal of fuel subsidies in late 2019, the country experienced a wave of protests that occasionally turned violent. The government ultimately reversed course. India, Indonesia, Yemen and Jordan have also been rocked by unrest tied to the rollback of fuel subsidies over the past 15 years.\n\nNigeria’s government is trying to remove gasoline subsidies for consumers this year. While the subsidies mean prices at the pump are among the lowest in the world, the World Bank has reported that they mostly help the wealthiest members of the population and entice smugglers. Still, large-scale protests one decade ago and the failure of previous attempts underscore how fraught the process will be.\n\nConcerns about fuel prices also affect the richest countries. In France, the gilet jaunes or “yellow vest” protest movement kicked off after President Emmanuel Macron’s government announced a new eco-tax on fuel in 2018, generating backlash among the country’s working and middle class living outside of major cities.\n\n“These people needed to have purchasing power to get gas in their car so that’s why the protest began,” Samy Shalaby, an early yellow vest activist, told CNN in 2019. “But after that the people wanted to do more than challenge one tax, they wanted to change the democracy … the entire economic model.”\n\nTo successfully roll back subsidies, governments need to plan well in advance, Wooders said. The impact on lower-income households can be mitigated by providing direct cash payments to offset price increases — an approach that tends to be much cheaper than maintaining fuel subsidies in the long run. Communication about the move also needs to be deliberate and clear, and leaders should consider a phased approach, he added.\n\nBut with energy costs already skyrocketing, anger over inflation smoldering and pandemic fatigue setting in, leaders that want to address subsidies will need to tread carefully.\n\n“The Kazakhstan unrest already demonstrates that people are increasingly price-sensitive to oil products, with more ‘Pandemic Spring’ protests related to energy or government handling of Covid-19 being a risk,” Louise Dickson, an oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, said in a note to clients on Monday.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/12/consumer-boycott-feb-28-target-walmart-amazon/78385303007/", "title": "Consumers are boycotting major retailers.

They are calling on consumers to boycott specific retailers and for one day later this month to refrain from spending any money at all.\n\nNumerous social media accounts are sharing the message of a 24-hour consumer spending blackout planned for Feb. 28. Consumers are encouraged not to spend money in stores or online for the day, and if they have emergencies or essentials they need, they are encouraged to support a local small business.\n\nIt is unclear which organization started the Feb. 28 blackout campaign, but several Instagram posts by a group called The People's Union and its founder, who goes by the Instagram handle \"TheOneCalledJai\" have been reshared and circulated about the one-day blackout.\n\nFrom Bud Light to Target: Boycotts take off\n\nThe strategy has worked for the political right.\n\nIn campaigns using hashtags and slogans like “go woke go broke,” boycotts waged by conservative activists have taken aim at some of the nation’s largest consumer names, including retail chain Target. Some have succeeded in slashing sales and forcing policy changes.\n\nFollowers of Robby Starbuck pressured the likes of Walmart, Ford, Harley-Davidson and Tractor Supply to rein in their DEI efforts.\n\nBud Light, owned by beer giant Anheuser-Busch, struggled after conservative blowback over a social media campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nTarget moved its Pride displays from the entrances to the back of stores after shoppers confronted employees and vandalized displays. Last year, Target scaled back its Pride collection and did not carry the collection in all stores.\n\nA growing number of companies have retreated on DEI commitments as those efforts come under greater scrutiny in a rapidly changing legal and political climate.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump ordered federal agencies to crack down on DEI and investigate the DEI programs of private companies.\n\nNow Target and other companies find themselves under attack from the other side, facing calls for boycotts from DEI supporters angry over the rollbacks.\n\nThat's an increasingly common dilemma for corporations − and one of their own making, said David Primo, professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. He blames years of \"haphazard policymaking\" by companies on contentious issues like DEI.\n\n“Companies need to figure out what they will take positions on, what they won’t take positions on, and then stand firm,\" Primo said. \"Holding your finger to the political winds is not an effective way to run a company in a polarized world.”\n\nWhat is the Feb. 28 consumer economic blackout?\n\nIn one of several videos about the Feb. 28 blackout, the Instagram handle \"TheOneCalledJai\" said the day of economic resistance is to show that \"we the people are the system.\"\n\n\"For decades, they have told us that we are powerless, that we have no control, and that this system is too big, too strong, too unshakable.\n\n\"We are going to remind them who has the power. For one day, we turn it off for one day. We shut it down for one day. We remind them that this country does not belong to the elite, it belongs to the people, and this will work.\n\n\"Some of you might say one day won't make a difference and that's exactly what they want you to believe,\" the video said. \"If enough of us participate, they will feel it and if they don't listen, we escalate.\"\n\nA second economic blackout aimed at blocking purchases from Amazon from March 7 through March 14 has also been announced by the same group.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, John Schwarz, who is the man behind the Instagram handle, said what started as a bold idea while he was posting a video to express his frustration has gained traction quickly.\n\n\"I'm trying to use my platform right now to organize and gather people who can see past what divides us and potentially maybe down the road legally find some way to unionize ourselves, to create a powerful voice within the system to create change,\" Schwarz said.\n\n\"But for now, the economic blackout is about getting people together, up off the couch, so to speak, to do something together.\"\n\nSchwarz said the blackout isn't intended to protest one specific thing, but the timing is right.\n\nSchwarz said he will start with the one-day economic blackout and March Amazon boycott to get people gathered and then expand to monthly boycotts of other businesses \"that are really the biggest offenders within the system.\" Schwarz said he is running the effort alone but is looking for people to join him.

The boycott started Feb. 1 in response to Target's decision to phase out DEI initiatives. It is an indefinite boycott until Target changes its actions, said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network.\n\nThe DEI retreat \"really felt like a slap in the face,\" Levy Armstrong told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Target was a beloved community that seemed to build its model around embracing diversity and being intentionally inclusive of having Black brands on the shelves, having beautiful Black History Month displays. For them to essentially bow down to the mandates of the Trump administration was unacceptable.\"\n\nThe boycott coincides with Black History Month. Organizers, which include several other civil rights organizations in Minnesota, have since encouraged consumers to support Black-owned brands in Target by buying directly from the businesses' websites after some Black-owned businesses expressed concern about the boycott.\n\nLevy Armstrong said support for the boycott has been good, and she sees other boycotts planned against Target and other companies as \"complementary.\" Her groups' efforts for now will be focused on Target, she said.\n\n\"People feel empowered in a moment in which they felt powerless and somewhat helpless.\"\n\nLatino community also boycotting with #LatinoFreeze\n\nThe Latino community also is encouraging a freeze on spending. Using the hashtags #LatinoFreezeMovement and #LatinoFreeze, social media posts for the movement have encouraged supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe website latinofreeze.com has a list of companies that have been supportive or critical of DEI efforts.\n\nMore consumer boycotts planned\n\nAt least two other consumer boycotts are planned.\n\nComedian and actress Leslie Jones announced on her Instagram account planned boycotts and buying actions starting in February and continuing through the end of the year. That plan explained in the video starts and ends with encouraging purchases directly from Black-owned businesses and then planned boycotts for one to two months at a time against Walmart, Target and Amazon.\n\nPastor Jamal-Harrison Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia and an activist and author, has called on the faith community to start a 40-day fast from shopping at Target during Lent starting on March 5, which is Ash Wednesday. The website targetfast.org also has been created to offer information.\n\nTarget and Amazon did not return messages seeking comment about potential boycotts. A Walmart spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nBoycotts can be successful, but for different reasons\n\nBoycotts can be effective, but not in the way that consumers think, said Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe boycotts create attention for the cause, including from the media, which \"puts a negative spotlight on the companies they're boycotting, and that could in the long run have reputational consequences,\" King told USA TODAY. \"What boycotts don't seem to do is have much of an impact on consumer behavior.\"\n\nConsumers can usually handle a boycott for a day, \"but over longer periods of time, most boycotts don't have any kind of impact on sales.\"\n\nThat's because consumer purchasing, especially for online shopping, \"tends to occur in private where others can't see or judge them.\"\n\nKing said a boycott of Bud Light in 2023, sparked by conservative consumers upset that the beer maker had teamed up with a transgender influencer, was successful because of a couple of key reasons.\n\nPeople tend to consume beer in public, so they could be held accountable, King said. There also were easy substitutes of other beer brands that consumers could choose instead.\n\nFor a boycott to be successful, organizers also have to figure out what success means: \"Is it that customers can feel better about expressing their values, or is it intended to change corporate behavior?\" said Gerald Davis, a professor of management and sociology at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\nA boycott needs a clear goal, a clear target group and an identifiable representative of that group who can negotiate with the target on their behalf, he said.\n\n\"Simply asking customers to stop buying a product to express disapproval is not likely to produce any recognizable change in what business does,\" he said.\n\nConsumers can express their voice through a boycott\n\nStill, a boycott can be a positive way for consumers to express themselves through action, King said.\n\n\"Saying you're going to boycott something does feel like you're casting a vote that you hope makes a difference down the road,\" he said. It is a way for people upset about the Trump administration's actions or companies' responses to DEI initiatives \"to convert grievances into action.\"\n\nToo many protest actions can cause confusion\n\nThere are also several social media messages that outline other boycott efforts in different time frames against specific retailers. That is usually \"one of the biggest difficulties activists face, which is they're not just competing with all the other events and things that are happening with the world, but also competing with each other and for attention,\" King said.\n\nThe most successful boycotts are ones where \"there's a lot of unity among the various strands of people who count themselves ... in that camp.\"\n\nShopping in support of a business can also work\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network have recently taken action at two Costco locations in New York City and in Union, New Jersey, to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company board of director's actions to vote down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nNational Action Network also said in a news release about the \"buy-cott\" that it will lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

The comedian’s frequent and sometimes inaccurate claims about Covid-19 and vaccines on his very popular, “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast led some artists to leave the site in protest.\n\nSpotify’s paying customers apparently couldn’t care less.\n\nDespite the backlash, Spotify (SPOT) saw its paid memberships increase, and the platform now has 182 million premium subscribers — up from 180 million in the previous quarter and 15% higher year over year, the company said in its first quarter earnings report Wednesday. Total revenue was up 24% over last year.\n\nThose numbers are roughly in line with what the company said it was expecting in terms of growth. In fact, Spotify noted that it would have done even better had it not pulled out of Russia in April following the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Excluding the impact of our exit from Russia, subscriber growth exceeded expectations,” the company said.\n\nSo although Rogan may have caused a massive PR headache for the company, Spotify didn’t experience a mass exodus because of him — at least not from those who pay for the service.\n\nIn February, artists such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify to pull their music from the platform because of Covid comments made on Rogan’s show. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” Young said at the time.\n\nOther performers such as Crosby, Stills and Nash and India Arie followed suit.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Spotify added a content advisory to all podcast episodes that include discussions of Covid-19.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek also addressed the controversy in February, saying that the company is “trying to balance creative expression with the safety of our users.”\n\n“Of course, this is a very complicated issue,” Ek said on the company’s February post-earnings. “But I’m really proud of the steps that we took following the concerns raised by the medical and scientific communities.”\n\nAs for Rogan, he responded to the situation at the time by saying “he’s not trying to promote misinformation.” More recently, the host claimed he had a subscriber boost because of the uproar.\n\n“It’s interesting, but my subscriptions went up massively. That’s what’s crazy,” Rogan said on an episode earlier this month. “During the height of it all, I gained two million subscribers.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html", "title": "AI won an art contest, and artists are furious | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/media/ticketmaster-apology-taylor-swift-tickets/index.html", "title": "Ticketmaster apologizes to Taylor Swift and her fans for ticketing ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Taylor Swift and her fans late Friday night after a ticketing debacle this week that made it difficult for consumers to buy tickets to the pop star’s new tour.\n\n“We want to apologize to Taylor and all of her fans — especially those who had a terrible experience trying to purchase tickets,” the ticketing site said in the blog post.\n\nThe company added that it strives to make ticket buying “as easy as possible,” but that “hasn’t been the case for many people trying to buy tickets” to Swift’s tour, which kicks off March 17 and will have 52 concerts in multiple stadiums across the US over five months.\n\nThe company said that it is working to “shore up our tech for the new bar that has been set by demand” for her tour. “Once we get through that, if there are any next steps, updates will be shared accordingly,” it wrote.\n\nThe mea culpa comes after Swift spoke out earlier on Friday about how the situation was “excruciating” for her to watch as it unfolded into chaos.\n\n“I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could,” the singer wrote in an Instagram post on Friday afternoon. “It’s truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.”\n\nSwift added that she would try to “figure out how this situation can be improved moving forward.”\n\nSales for the singer’s new Eras Tour began Tuesday, but overwhelming demand snarled the ticketing site, infuriating countless fans who couldn’t buy tickets. Customers complained on social media about Ticketmaster not loading, saying the platform didn’t allow them to access tickets, even if they had a pre-sale code for verified fans.\n\nOn Thursday, Ticketmaster announced that the sale to the general public, scheduled to begin Friday, was canceled due to “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”\n\n“To those who didn’t get tickets, all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to get together and sing these songs,” Swift said.\n\nThe Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into Live Nation, the owner of Ticketmaster, to look at whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The New York Times first reported the investigation Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been contacting music venues and other ticket market participants in recent months, asking about Live Nation’s practices and industry dynamics, the Times added.\n\nLive Nation responded Saturday in a statement posted to its website, saying that it “takes its responsibilities under the antitrust laws seriously” and “does not engage in behaviors that could justify antitrust litigation, let alone orders that would require it to alter fundamental business practices.”\n\n“The Department of Justice itself recognized the competitive nature of the concert promotion business at the time of the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger,” the company said in a statement. “That dynamic has not changed.”\n\nLive Nation added that the fact that Ticketmaster “continues to be the leader in such an environment is a testament to the platform and those who operate it, not to any anticompetitive business practices.”\n\n“We innovate and invest in our technology more than any other ticketing company, and we will continue to do so,” the company wrote, noting that Ticketmaster is the “most transparent and fan-friendly ticketing system in the United States.”\n\n– CNN’s Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report\n\n– Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the number of stadiums Taylor Swift will be playing on her Eras Tour.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/31/key-moments-from-jd-vance-interview-with-joe-rogan/75975181007/", "title": "Key moments from JD Vance interview with Joe Rogan", "text": "Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance sat down with popular podcaster Joe Rogan on Wednesday for a lengthy interview discussing his initial reaction to the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, views on transgender rights and his favorite Netflix guilty pleasure, among a wide range of topics.\n\nRogan hosts the most listened to podcast on Spotify, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” with roughly 14.5 million followers. His audience is predominantly composed of young men – a key voting demographic Trump and Vance are trying to turn out to vote in the 2024 election.\n\nVance’s appearance on the show comes less than a week before the contentious 2024 election and just days after Rogan spoke with Trump about everything from aliens to election interference.\n\nRogan often signaled agreement with Vance throughout the more than three-hour-long friendly conversation, and on several occasions questioned Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ fitness for office.\n\nVance frequently discussed his wife and two daughters throughout the show and at one point he described himself as a “pretty boring guy.” Along with in-depth policy discussions, Vance also gave insight into his personal life and said he believes the show ‘Emily in Paris’ on Netflix is “a masterpiece.”\n\nHere’s are key moments from the podcast episode.\n\nAnti-trans rhetoric\n\nRogan and Vance spoke at length about transgender rights early in the conversation, specifically about gender-affirming care for minors and whether people should be allowed to play on sports teams that match their gender identity.\n\n“I'm the father of a two-year-old daughter,” Vance said. “I don't want her going into athletic competitions where I'm terrified she's gonna get bludgeoned to death because we're allowing a six-foot one male to compete with her in sports,” Vance said.\n\nVance also suggested that wealthy parents might go so far as to coerce their children to undergo gender surgeries to get into better colleges and universities.\n\n“If you are a middle-class or upper-middle class white parent, and the only thing that you care about is whether your child goes into Harvard or Yale, obviously that pathway has become a lot harder for a lot of upper-middle class kids,” he said, adding that “the one way that those people can participate in the DEI bureaucracy in this country is to be trans.”\n\nVance later argued that he wouldn’t be surprised if Trump won “the normal gay guy vote because again, they just wanted to be left the hell alone.”\n\n“Now you have all this crazy stuff on top of it that they’re like, ‘No, no, we didn’t want to give pharmaceutical products to 9-year-olds who are transitioning their genders,’” Vance said.\n\nBiden 'garbage' comments\n\nVance joked during the interview that he believes President Joe Biden is “trying to help” Donald Trump win the election, referring to comments Biden made earlier in the week that suggested Trump supporters were “garbage.”\n\nBiden received blowback from Republicans and some Democrats for the comments, which the White House has said were about one supporter in particular – a comedian at a Trump rally who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nVance asserted that the comment had to be an attempt to help Trump, given the criticism Biden has since received.\n\n“After we win, I'm gonna be convinced that Joe Biden was trying to help us the whole time,” Vance said. He also referenced a moment where Biden jokingly put on a Trump 2024 hat during a visit to Pennsylvania on 9/11.\n\nVance also told Rogan that he’d bet $20 that Biden was planning to vote for Trump and $100 that his son, Hunter Biden, would also back the Republican nominee over Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.\n\nClimate change\n\nDuring a prolonged discussion about the environment, Vance asserted that he “didn’t have a strong view about what the carbon footprint ultimately does,” appearing to waffle about whether human-caused climate change exists.\n\n“It's interesting that the environmental movement in America, the only thing that it talks about is the carbon footprint, and it never talks about . . . why do we have the highest rates of obesity in the world right now,” Vance said.\n\nRogan added that it was “disturbing” that “there's also profit that's being made off the green movement,” and name-checked Bill Gates who has invested billions of dollars in climate technology solutions.\n\nThe podcaster also brought up an unproven statement from his interview with Trump: that wind-turbines, a form of clean energy, are negatively affecting and even killing whales. There is no evidence to support those statements. Most whale deaths humans are aware of are caused by boats and entanglement in fishing gear.\n\nWhere was Vance during Trump assassination?\n\nVance told Rogan that he was mini golfing with his family in Ohio when he learned that Trump had been shot in the ear during his Butler, Pa. rally in June.\n\n\"I actually thought they had killed him because when you first see the video he grabs his ear and then he goes down,\" Vance recalled after seeing the video of Trump's July 13 rally. \"I'm like, 'Oh my God, they just killed him.'”\n\nJust days before, Vance said Trump had told him he was a front-runner for vice presidential nominee. Trump had floated announcing the news at the rally, but had decided against it.\n\nVance, who is a Marine veteran, said his immediate reaction to the news of the assassination attempt was to load his guns.\n\n\"At first I was so pissed, but then I go into like fight or flight mode,” he said. “I grab my kids up, throw them in the car, go home and load all my guns. And basically stand like a sentry in our front door, and that was my reaction to it.”\n\nRogan talks Harris\n\nRogan at serval points throughout the podcast expressed skepticism about Harris’ candidacy for president.\n\n“It's just strange that everyone's accepting that this person who is the least popular vice president ever is now the solution to the problem,” he told Vance, arguing that \"the media machine in just a few days, did this 180 and just sold her as the solution.”\n\n“As long as they keep her from having these conversations where she's allowed to talk, they're able to pull this off, and the fact that it’s happening without a primary should be really concerning to people,” he said of Harris’ campaign.\n\nHarris faced criticism for not doing many interviews in the first few months after taking over the Democratic Party nomination from Biden. Since then, she has embarked on a media blitz with appearances on several podcasts, daytime talk shows and news programs.\n\nAt one point, Harris was in talks to appear on Rogan’s show. The podcaster said earlier this week that that Harris’ had agreed to appear on his podcast, but that he had declined the terms of the interview because he would have had to travel and wanted to speak with her for more than an hour.\n\n\"My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being,\" Rogan said about the possibility of interviewing Harris. \"I really hope we can make it happen.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/30/whopper-swordfish-alaska-quaketsunami-masks-indoors-foolish-news-around-states/117689494/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The U.S. Department of Justice won’t help defend Republican U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama against a civil lawsuit that claims he helped to incite the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol. In a court filing Tuesday, the Justice Department urged a judge to deny the congressman’s request for immunity as a federal employee over his remarks at a pro-Donald Trump rally that occurred before the rioting at the .Capitol. Brooks had argued that he was acting within the scope of his office when he spoke at a rally Jan. 6 and thus was due the legal protections afforded federal employees and members of Congress who are facing civil lawsuits over their jobs. The Justice Department said the event was campaign-related and it would not certify that Brooks was acting in his official capacity. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who served as a House manager in Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit in March against the former president and others, including Brooks, whose actions he charges led to the events.\n\nAlaska\n\nPerryville: A powerful earthquake that struck just off Alaska’s southern coast caused prolonged shaking and prompted tsunami warnings that sent people scrambling for shelters. Residents reported only minor damage, but officials said that could change after sunrise and people get a better look. The National Tsunami Warning Center canceled the warnings early Thursday when the biggest wave, of just over a half-foot, was recorded in Old Harbor. A tsunami warning that had also been issued for Hawaii was also canceled, and officials said there was no threat to Guam, American Samoa or the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. The warning for Alaska covered nearly a 1,000-mile stretch from Prince William Sound to Samalga Island, near the end of the Aleutian Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 8.2 and hit 56 miles east southeast of Perryville at about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. The quake was about 29 below the surface of the ocean according to USGS. Several other earthquakes, some with with preliminary magnitudes of 6.2 and 5.6, occurred in the same area within hours of the first one, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Drought conditions still exist across Arizona but recent monsoon rain has had a significant impact for the better. The latest drought monitor “shows substantial improvement” in the two most severe drought categories, now reporting 52% of Arizona in either extreme or exceptional drought, down from 84% last week, the National Weather Service office in Phoenix said Thursday. The month isn’t even over yet and Tucson has recorded its wettest July in the city’s history. The southern Arizona city received 7.08 inches of rain as of Wednesday, according to the National weather service. That breaks the previous July record of 6.8 inches set in 2017. Because of an active monsoon season, Tucson has been hit with more than 5 inches of rain since last July 23. Meteorologists said the normal rainfall amount for Tucson in July is about 2 inches. Meanwhile, Phoenix has received 1.67 inches of rain this month, its wettest July since 2013.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees approved a plan to keep a statue of the late Democratic Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus, despite calls to remove it because of his support of segregation. The board approved a resolution that called for keeping the statue at its location on the Fayetteville campus, but with “contextualization” about Fulbright’s legacy. The resolution cited a new Arkansas law that prohibits removing or relocating monuments without state approval. The resolution approved also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’s college of arts and sciences. Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Jose Sanchez Villalobos, the architect of a subterranean tunnel that shuttled tons of marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. for drug cartel Sinaola under Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was sentenced in San Diego federal court to 10 years and one month in custody for a drug-distribution conspiracy – just over the 10-year minimum mandatory sentence. Villalobos’ tunnel linked a Tijuana warehouse to another in Otay Mesa and was equipped with a hydraulic elevator, electric rail cars, lighting, wooden floors and a storeroom. It was a feat of engineering that U.S. authorities would later marvel at as the “most elaborate smuggling tunnel” to be uncovered along the U.S.-Mexico border at the time. In a plea agreement in December, Sanchez admitted to planning, financing and supervising the construction of “multiple” cross-border tunnels from 2010 to 2012, as well as overseeing their operation as smuggling conduits. Sanchez, 58, has already served most of his prison term. Since his arrest in Mexico in 2012, he has spent about eight years in custody there and another year and a half in San Diego after being extradited to face charges in the U.S. With good behavior credits, he is likely due to be released within a few months.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Boulder County has suspended consideration of a permit needed for a long-sought reservoir expansion by Denver Water until a federal court hears a lawsuit filed by the utility that alleged the county is stalling on the permit and jeopardizing the project. The county on Tuesday said it had agreed to a Denver Water request to put the process on hold pending the outcome of the suit, which Denver Water filed in U.S. District Court on July 14. It canceled public hearings on the project set for August and September. Denver Water contended it has made good-faith efforts over several years on a local-use land review needed to begin work on Gross Reservoir. It alleged the county has used the process to delay the review, jeopardizing federal and other deadlines for the project. In June, county planning and permitting staff determined that Denver Water hadn’t provided satisfactory answers to requests for information on the project. The Gross Reservoir Expansion Project would be the largest construction project in the history of Boulder County. It would raise the 340-foot Gross Dam by an additional 131 feet, increasing reservoir capacity by 77,000 acre-feet. Environmentalists and many local residents argued it will cause serious impacts to the environment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal appeals court overturned a lower court order issued last year that required Connecticut to resume fingerprinting for gun permit applicants despite the state’s suspension of those services because of the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York vacated the preliminary injunction on technical grounds. The judges also noted local police resumed fingerprinting shortly before the June 2020 preliminary injunction was issued, and state police resumed the services shortly after it was issued. The Connecticut Citizens Defense League and six people seeking gun permits sued Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, the state’s public safety commissioner and local police chiefs in federal court in New Haven, saying the suspension of fingerprinting services violated their Second Amendment gun rights. Judge Jeffrey Meyer agreed and issued the injunction requiring fingerprinting to resume. The appeals court judges said the six plaintiffs’ claims were moot because fingerprinting resumed, and the defense league did not have legal standing to be a part of the case.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The city is granting some parking violators amnesty as it returns to normal operations. The city issued about 1,800 tickets on Monday and Tuesday to residents for failing to update their parking permits or move their cars for street cleaning, Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a news release. The city announced last week that enforcement suspended because of the pandemic would resume, but because so many people were ticketed, the mayor said the city will offer limited ticket amnesty this week only. Tickets issued for these violations between Monday and Friday will be converted to warnings and anyone who has paid will get a refund, Purzycki said, but “ticketing will resume as normal” starting Monday. The amnesty does not apply to metered parking tickets or any other parking enforcement violation. City officials are reminding residents that other city services that have resumed include ticketing, booting and towing of vehicles for traffic and parking violations and for delinquent fines and fees, water utility service disconnections for delinquencies and sheriff sales.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The White House Historical Association unveiled three new historical markers at the northern end of Lafayette Park – less than a block from the White House. The three large horizontal tablets have illustrations and text that address different issues. One focuses on the construction of the White House, with an emphasis on the fact that enslaved people and paid laborers took part. The second focuses on former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who founded the association in 1961. The third addresses Lafayette Park’s history as a center for public protests, dating to 1917 and continuing through last summer’s protests over police brutality and racial injustice. The intersection of 16th and H streets in front of the markers was officially named Black Lives Matter Plaza by the city government last year. Stewart McLaurin, the president of the association, credited former first lady Michelle. Obama with unintentionally jump-starting the project. As first lady, she publicly spoke multiple times of her intense awareness that she woke up every morning in a house built by enslaved people. The White House Historical Association is a nonprofit donor-supported group that helps maintain many of the White House’s interior furnishings. It also funds the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Florida man was discovered inside a giant floating contraption shaped like a hamster wheel on a beach, according to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office. The agency said the “driver” Reza Baluchi was not injured. The 49-year-old told authorities he was attempting to raise money for charity by “running” on water from St. Augustine to New York City by way of Bermuda, but ran into some problems. Baluchi and his hydropod, as he calls it, washed ashore near Hammock, in Flagler County, about 30 miles from where he first started the endeavor in St. Johns County. Flagler County deputies said they arrived at the beach after several alarmed callers reported seeing the UFO, unidentified floating object. The hydropod is basically a metal cylinder with paddle wheels. The long-distance runner told authorities he “came across some complications that brought him back to shore.” The money Baluchi was trying to raise was to go to first responders, the kind that just got him out of his latest situation. The vessel is reportedly outfitted with GPS and enough food and water for days. This is hardly the adventurer’s first brush with disaster: Baluchi made his first failed attempt in 2014, trying to get to travel north, before having to be rescued in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of $144,000 to taxpayers. His second attempt two years later also failed when he was stopped by the Coast Guard for safety reasons.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia is asking a judge to toss out a Department of Justice lawsuit challenging the state’s sweeping new election law. In a motion to dismiss filed Wednesday in federal court in Atlanta, attorneys for the state called the lawsuit “a politicized intrusion” into the state’s constitutional authority to regulate its elections. The state’s election laws “are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and well within the mainstream of election laws across the country,” they wrote. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the lawsuit last month, saying that Republican state lawmakers in Georgia had rushed the election overhaul through with an intent to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot. The move by the Biden administration came two weeks after Garland said his department would look closely at Republican-led efforts to tighten state voting rules. He said the federal government would act if prosecutors found unlawful activity. The U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta declined to comment on the motion to dismiss.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on the nomination of Daniel Gluck, the executive director of the Hawaii Ethics Commission, to serve on the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Critics have questioned Gov. David Ige’s choice of Gluck, a white man, for the job, noting it has been 30 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the appeals court and 20 since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the Supreme Court. Others have questioned his legal experience given he hasn’t brought as many cases to trial as other potential nominees put forward by the state Judicial Selection Commission. The committee didn’t vote on the nomination. Judiciary Committee Chairman Karl Rhoads said the committee would vote on Wednesday. Gluck’s supporters noted his keen legal mind, his dedication to social justice and his fairness.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise said a Boeing 737 from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service in Australia arrived at the center last weekend to help fight wildfires. The jet is being made available through an agreement between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Australia. The airtanker has two internal tanks with a capacity of 4,000 gallons. The aircraft is named Marie Bashir after Dame Marie Bashir, a former governor of New South Wales. “We greatly appreciate having this airtanker from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service assisting us,” said Kim Christensen, deputy assistant director for operations for the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re proud of the long history of cooperation we have with Australia and other countries.” The center moved to national preparedness level 5 earlier this month. That’s the highest level and means firefighting resources are stretched thin because of multiple large wildfires burning in the West. The center said that on Thursday there are 82 large, active fires in 13 states that have burned 2,600 square miles. More than 21,500 firefighters and support personnel are mobilized to fight the wildfires. So far this year, wildfires have burned more than 5,300 square miles.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Severe thunderstorms swept through the Chicago area and northern Illinois early Thursday with high winds that left thousands of homes and businesses without power. The National Weather Service said several areas recorded wind gusts in excess of 60 mph that knocked down tree limbs or toppled whole trees, damaging some power lines. Weather observers recorded a 64 mph wind gust at the DuPage Airport in DuPage County about 3 a.m., and the Chicago Executive Airport in Cook County had a 55 mph wind gust. ComEd reported that more than 24,000 of its customers remained without power at about 7:20 a.m. The Illinois Department of Transportation said some trees were toppled in Waukegan just before 4 a.m., as the storms pushed across the area. The National Weather Service said “life-threatening” swim conditions were expected Thursday on Lake Michigan as a cold front moved its way through the area, bringing cooler, less humid air. According to a beach hazard statement, waves of 4 to 7 feet and rip currents are expected along the lake in Cook County and in northwestern Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties until Friday night.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Indiana University and the city of Bloomington plan to rename Jordan Avenue after local residents who rose to prominence after escaping slavery. A task force is recommending the city-owned section from East Davis Street to 17th Street be named Eagleson Avenue, and the university-owned section, from East 17th Street to Fee Lane, be named Fuller Lane or Mattie Fuller Lane. The city said in a news release its portion of the street would be named after the Eagleson family, whose members for four generations made significant contributions to the city, university, state and nation, starting with Halson Vashon Eagleson, who was born into slavery in 1851 and came to Bloomington in the 1880s. The university’s portion would be named after Mattie Jacobs Fuller, who was born into slavery in 1856 but lived in Bloomington from age 4 until her death in 1940. The news release said she was a successful businesswoman and suffragist and made the donation that founded Bethel AME Church.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An influential hog dealer sanctioned twice for defrauding pork producers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars said it has fired employees responsible for its latest violations and paid restitution to affected sellers. Lynch Livestock, based in Waucoma, also announced that pork industry veteran Dan Sutherland would lead the company going forward “as a further safeguard against future violations,” citing Sutherland’s experience in compliance matters. Lynch announced those moves in a press release posted online Wednesday, after the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had taken enforcement action against the company for illegal buying practices for the second time since 2017. The company’s longtime owner, Gary Lynch, a top booster of Iowa State athletics and political donor to Iowa Republican elected officials, hasn’t returned messages seeking comment. In the press release, his company said the USDA received a complaint in January that employees at its Waucoma buying station were manipulating the scale and issuing false tickets to artificially lower payments to producers. Lynch said it investigated the allegations and terminated an unspecified number of employees who engaged in those practices. The USDA has not revoked Lynch’s dealer license and praised the company in a press release last week for its cooperation and voluntary corrective actions. The company operates 39 buying stations across eight Midwestern states, and markets hogs to major packing plants across the country.\n\nKansas\n\nLeawood: A Leawood physician has surrendered his medical license after admitting that he told a drug company he would not sell one of their products unless he was hired for more speaking engagements. Dr. Steven M. Simon gave up his medical license this month after being sentenced in April to three years of probation for soliciting health care kickbacks, KCUR reported. Simon was also ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Simon, a pain doctor, admitted in January that he told a representative for AstraZeneca that he would not continue to prescribe Movantik, which is used to treat constipation caused by opioid medications, unless he was paid for more speaking engagements. The company then determined it would no longer hire Simon as a speaker, according to his plea. Doctors can legally accept meals, speaking fees and other compensation from drug and medical device companies but cannot receive kickbacks for prescribing drugs or medical devices. Simon has also been sued by patients who claimed he prescribed them fentanyl spray because its manufacturer, Insys Therapeutics, was paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: A ferry that carries vehicles across the Mississippi River between Kentucky and Missouri is reopening after a one-day closure for engine maintenance, officials said. The work was completed earlier than expected, allowing the Dorena-Hickman Ferry to reopen Thursday morning, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. Capt. Jeremy Newsom had anticipated the closure to last for a few days. The ferry connects Kentucky 1354 at Hickman, Kentucky, with Missouri Route A and Route 77 near Dorena, Missouri. It is the only direct route between the states.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A judge is allowing some of those being sentenced to probation in his court to get a COVID-19 vaccination to reduce their community service requirement. Judge Fred Crifasi in Baton Rouge said vaccination is not mandated but offered as an option. “Getting vaccinated is a service to the community,” Crifasi said Thursday in an emailed statement to the Associated Press. “We are currently in a serious predicament in Louisiana. So, if a probation candidate is inclined to get vaccinated, I will grant credit for that effort towards any requirement of community service. The amount of hours varies and depends on the person’s circumstances. It is not a mandate. If a person is not inclined, they do not have to do it.” Crifasi’s probation option is being offered as coronavirus infections across the state are skyrocketing. The state health department reported 4,413 new COVID-19 cases Thursday and the daily hospitalization number was 1,620, nearly 100 more than a day earlier. It had been below 300 for much of May and all of June. Louisiana has been among the states with the lowest overall vaccination rate.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine church that sued over coronavirus restrictions last year is taking a preemptive legal strike against future restrictions associated with a variant of the virus that’s spreading across the country. Calvary Chapel in Orrington is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Janet Mills from enforcing or reinstating any pandemic-related restrictions because of the delta variant. The state responded by noting that the governor’s civil emergency already expired, making the lawsuit unnecessary. “For more than two months, there have been no restrictions whatsoever on the size of gatherings, and the state of emergency expired at the end of June. Given that, we are disappointed that Calvary Chapel continues to waste public and judicial resources by attempting to litigate an issue that is now moot,” said Marc Malon, spokesperson for the state attorney general’s office. But church officials are worried that restrictions could be reinstated. Describing Mills’ previous restrictions as a 14-month “reign of terror,” church officials claimed in their request for a preemptive injunction that any restrictions would violate their religious liberties protected by the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has heard similar requests on behalf of religious organizations and lifted limits in California.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:Peter Schultz, aboard the boat the Reel One, caught a 301-pound swordfish at the Big Fish Classic Tournament on July 23, setting a state record. Schultz became the first officially recognized record-holder for swordfish, according to the Maryland Department of National Resources. The DNR maintains state records for four divisions of fish: Atlantic, Chesapeake, Nontidal and Invasive. Until Schultz, the swordfish category within the Atlantic division was vacant in the record books, with no one claiming that spot in state history. Schultz called the catch \"the fish of a lifetime,\" according to a news release from the Department of National Resources. Schultz, an Annapolis resident, was about 50 miles offshore at Washington Canyon when he made the catch. It took Schultz and his team 8 hours to bring in the fish.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreenfield: Magician Penn Jillette is urging people to support a fundraising effort by the agricultural fair in his Massachusetts hometown he credits with inspiring his show business career. Jillette said he saw his first fire eater and his first freak show at the Franklin County Fair in Greenfield and spent some of the “happiest times of my life” there. He made the comments in a nearly 4-minute video posted on the fair’s Facebook page Wednesday. He even participated in the demolition derby one year. “I can trace my whole career back to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and the Franklin County Fair,” the talking half of the Penn & Teller comedy/magic team, said in the video. The fair, run by the Franklin County Agricultural Society, is still trying raise about $90,000 toward its $260,000 goal so it can fix erosion damage at the fairgrounds and make other improvements. Fair President Michael Nelson told Masslive.com that he emailed Jillette’s representatives asking for help, and got a response from Jillette about an hour later. The fair was canceled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, but is scheduled for Sept. 9-12 this year. The fair is “America at its best,” Jillette, who lives in Las Vegas, said in the video.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:City Council member Andre Spivey has been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and accused of accepting $1,000 from an undercover law enforcement agent. Spivey was named late Tuesday in an indictment filed in federal court in Detroit. The bribe allegedly was accepted on Oct. 26, 2018, according to the indictment which also said that between 2016 and 2020, Spivey and “public official A” accepted more than $35,000 in payments to influence votes “concerning an industry under review by the council.” Public official A is identified in the indictment as a member of Spivey’s staff. Elliott Hall, an attorney for Spivey, said the indictment was expected. Hall said Spivey did nothing in return for the money and had been cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s office for more than a year. The Associated Press left voicemails Wednesday seeking comment from Hall and Spivey on the indictment. Spivey represents the city’s District 4 and first was elected in 2009. He did not file for reelection and is not on the ballot for the city’s Aug. 3 primary.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRed Lake: A man was charged Wednesday in the killing of a Red Lake Nation police officer who was fatally shot while responding to a call to a residence on the tribe’s reservation in northwestern Minnesota. David Donnell Jr., 28, of Redby was charged in federal court with one count of second-degree murder and four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon in the death of Officer Ryan Bialke. Bialke, 37, was killed Tuesday after he went to Donnell’s home on a report of a suicidal male with children possibly in the residence, according to the Red Lake Department of Public Safety. Federal authorities said Donnell was standing on the porch when officers arrived, then went inside the house. Because Donnell refused to comply with orders from the officers and had an active warrant, police broke down the front door, Department of Justice officials said. That’s when Donnell began firing. Bialke was struck by gunfire and died at the scene, officials said. Donnell fled and was taken into custody at a nearby residence a short time later, authorities said. Court documents do not list an attorney for Donnell. The tribe said Bialke was a six-year veteran of the Red Lake Police Department. He is survived by his wife and four children.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: Cases of COVID-19 are surging in Mississippi, but Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said a federal recommendation for people to wear masks indoors is “foolish.” “It has nothing to do with science,” Reeves said during a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, according to WAPT-TV Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and Reeves on Thursday encouraged people to get vaccinated. He went on camera to get his own vaccination early this year. But during his outdoor speech at the fair, Reeves repeated what his office had said earlier this week – he will not set a mask mandate for schools. Some Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others will begin by mid-August. “I don’t think you’re going to see any school district mandate masks in schools,” Reeves said at the fair, according to WJTV-TV. “I think if you start seeing them do that, the parents will erupt, and they should, and I feel certain they will.” Some Mississippi school districts have mask mandates for the new academic year, but others said wearing a mask is optional. Last week, the state Health Department recommended masks be worn indoors in school settings by all unvaccinated people 2 and older.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis County Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan said he was called racial slurs and physically assaulted after defending a new mask mandate to fight COVID-19. Khan said in response, he raised his middle finger at a crowd gathered at a St. Louis County Council meeting, according to a Wednesday letter obtained by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “After being physically assaulted, called racial slurs and surrounded by an angry mob, I expressed my displeasure by using my middle finger toward an individual who had physically threatened me and called me racist slurs,” Khan wrote to the councilwoman who led the meeting. The St. Louis County Council voted 5-2 on Tuesday to end the county’s mask mandate, saying the county executive did not consult with them before issuing it. County Executive Sam Page has insisted the mask mandate is still in effect, despite the vote. Orders took effect Monday there and in the city of St. Louis, requiring everyone age 5 or older to wear masks inside public spaces and on public transportation even if they are vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A prosecutor for the Crow Tribe accused a federal law enforcement officer of assault, criminal endangerment and negligent endangerment after the officer’s police dog allegedly caused extensive injuries to a suspect during a traffic stop. A civil complaint from prosecutor David Sibley seeks to ban Bureau of Indian Affairs officer Steve Stallings from the Crow reservation in southeastern Montana over the July 20 incident. Sibley said Thursday he filed the complaint a day earlier in Crow Nation Tribal Court, but did not know when Stallings would be officially served with the suit. Stallings was the handler for a dog that latched onto the leg of tribal member Harris Redstar following a traffic stop in Lodge Grass, according to the complaint. The dog continued to hold Redstar’s leg in its jaws even after he was on the ground and in handcuffs, causing extensive injuries that required Redstar to be hospitalized, the prosecutor said. Redstar had been in a confrontation with a second officer before Stallings’ arrival. He faces charges of resisting, obstructing and assaulting an officer and is due to make an initial court appearance next month, Sibley said. Stallings could not be reached for comment. A bureau spokesperson did not have an immediate response to the allegations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Police arrested a 31-year-old man who jumped the fence surrounding the Governor’s Mansion in Lincoln and sat down in the backyard, according to the Nebraska State Patrol. The incident happened Wednesday afternoon, when Gov. Pete Ricketts was not in the mansion, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. The patrol said State Capitol security spotted the man as he scaled the fence and entered the back yard. He was quickly arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, trespassing and criminal impersonation because police said he gave officers a fake name.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada casinos rode a robust economic rebound from coronavirus restrictions in June, taking in more than $1 billion in winnings for the fourth straight month and nearly reaching a record set a month earlier, state regulators reported Thursday. But a spike in COVID-19 cases since mid-May – and the restoration of indoor mask mandates for vaccinated and unvaccinated people beginning Friday – could cloud the July outlook for an economy heavily reliant on tourism and gambling. The Nevada Gaming Control Board said casinos reported house winnings of $1.19 billion statewide during the month. That was more than double the $567 million reported in June 2020, the first partial month of reopening after coronavirus pandemic casino closures, and topped the monthly casino win figure of $1.04 billion in June 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton noted the last time casinos totaled billion-dollar winnings for four straight months was January to April 2008.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSalem: Gov. Chris Sununu signed three bills aimed at protecting not just canines but cats and wild critters, as well. Animal equity was the theme for two of the new laws: One will require drivers who injure or kill cats to notify police or the pets’ owners or else face a $1,000 fine, a mandate that has long existed for dogs. Another would expand the state’s animal cruelty laws and make it illegal to beat, whip, torture or mutilate any wild animal, fish or bird. The third bill, however, focuses squarely on dogs, making it a misdemeanor to maliciously remove a tracking collar or microchip from someone else’s dog. The bill, which also makes stealing a dog a felony for a second offense, was prompted by what supporters described as a growing problem of “dog flipping” in which people steal dogs to sell for profit. All three laws take effect Jan. 1.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCamden: A former teacher and child protective services worker who admitted to producing child pornography images of a young boy who was in his care has been sentenced to nearly 21 years in federal prison. Kayan Frazier, 29, of Somers Point will also have to pay his victim restitution under the 250-month sentence imposed Tuesday, although the amount has not yet been determined. He will also be on permanent supervised release once he’s freed from prison. Frazier had pleaded guilty in February to sexual exploitation of a child. Frazier was a substitute teacher for the Atlantic City School District between 2015 and 2017 before taking a job with the state Department of Child Protection and Permanency. The exploitation of the child occurred between March 2017 and April 2019, according to federal prosecutors. Authorities executed a search warrant at Frazier’s home in April 2019 after law enforcement officials learned that child porn images were being shared online by Frazier, prosecutors have said. He was at the home that day with the boy, and authorities have not said how long Frazier had been caring for the child. Authorities recovered thousands of images of child sexual abuse on Frazier’s cellphone and other electronic media, including images of the boy, which had been taken in Frazier’s apartment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance will be holding statewide protests against mask-wearing requirements in schools on Saturday. The group has been rallying to push the state to remove all requirements for mask-wearing and allow parents and students to decide whether they want to wear a mask. Last year, the New Mexico Public Education Department required all to mask up on school grounds to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. This year, the requirements are a bit complicated and largely in flux. On Monday, the Public Education Department issued a more relaxed mask-wearing policy, stating individuals in secondary schools do not need to wear masks if fully vaccinated. All students and staff in primary schools are still required to wear masks. Masks will not be required outside for anyone. The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance said masks have negatively impacted students by impeding their learning and causing headaches and other physical ailments. The protests will take place in about 15 cities across New Mexico. In Las Cruces, a protest will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Albert Johnson Park on the corner of Main Street and Picacho Avenue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Eight years after a judge ruled police violated the constitution by stopping, questioning and frisking mostly Black and Hispanic people on the street en masse, people in communities most affected by such tactics say they have been shut out of the legal process to end them. Attorneys for plaintiffs in two landmark stop-and-frisk lawsuits said in court papers Thursday that community stakeholders have had “very little contact” in the last three years with the court-appointed monitor overseeing reforms and that reports he has issued don’t reflect their experiences. They’re demanding greater input, including an advisory board comprised mostly of reform advocates and public housing residents, annual community surveys and biannual audits of NYPD stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activity – the results of which would then be summarized in public reports every six months.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville:State officials are for the second time in slightly more than a year trying to determine the source of potentially harmful compounds found in foam floating on a creek. In both instances, the man-made chemicals found in the Gray’s Creek area don’t appear to be connected to the Chemours plant, which is in the same area and makes a similar compound, The Fayetteville Observer reported. The state Department of Environmental Quality said in a memo dated June 22 that tests were conducted in March on foam from an unnamed tributary of Rockfish Creek. The tests showed that the foam contained perfluorooctane sulfonate, also known as PFOS, and three other compounds. In July 2020, department officials said tests on foam found floating in a creek revealed high levels of PFOS. This year’s memo noted that there are no federal or state health advisory levels for polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS compounds, in surface water or in foam. This year’s results showed PFOS levels at 614 parts per trillion, well above the 70 parts per trillion set for drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency The agency has found that PFOS can have harmful impacts on people’s health at certain levels. including cancer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Minnesota electric company that wants to sell its financially troubled coal-fueled power plant in North Dakota expects to know Friday if its member utility cooperatives will endorse the deal that includes purchasing electricity over the next decade from the factory’s prospective buyer. North Dakota officials have hailed the potential sale announced last month of Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station to Rainbow Energy Center as a savior for hundreds of jobs at the plant and an associated lignite coal mine that are about 50 miles north of Bismarck. North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum called the announcement a “huge sigh of relief” for the plant and mine, nearby communities and workers. But opponents believe the sale is delaying an inevitable closure, as coal continues to be eliminated from energy portfolios and regulations mount to curb the climate change effects of burning the fuel. The companies have not publicly disclosed terms of the deal, which includes an associated transmission line that runs more than 400 miles from central North Dakota to Minnesota.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: Amusement park operator Cedar Fair Entertainment said it plans to add esports to its lineup of roller coasters and water parks. It wants to build a 1,500-seat esports arena in Ohio for gaming tournaments near Cedar Point, its flagship amusement park in Sandusky, the company announced Thursday. The Ohio-based amusement park chain hopes to begin construction on the $28 million arena by the end of the year. The company said it believes it will be a draw for gamers across the Midwest. Plans call for the arena to have 200 gaming stations and host tournaments year-round beginning in the first half of 2023. It also could be used for concerts and other events, the company said. The building will have locker rooms, a food court and dormitory rooms for esports participants.The booming esports industry is especially popular among teens and youngers adults, which also is a target audience for the company’s 11 amusement parks and four separate water parks across the U.S.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of initial unemployment claims and the less volatile moving four-week average of initial claims are down in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission reported Thursday. The number of initial weekly claims fell by about 50%, from 7,787 to 4,394, and the moving average dropped from 8,237 to 7,046, the agency reported. “The decline is a promising indicator of the direction we’re heading,” said OESC director Shelly Zumwalt. “We are continuing to review applications for the Back-to-Work Initiative,” a $1,200 stipend offered to anyone returning to work for 32 or more hours per week for six consecutive weeks.The state’s latest unemployment rate of 3.7% in June was down from a high of 14.7% in April 2020 during a shutdown amid the coronavirus outbreak. The state health department reported 1,806 new virus cases and a seven-day average of 1,268 daily cases, compared to a seven-day average of 196 on June 25, as infections have increased with the highly contagious delta variant sweeping across the state.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has banned homeless people from camping in forested parks both to protect them from potential wildfires and prevent them from accidentally starting blazes during a summer of drought and record-breaking heat. The City Council adopted the rule Wednesday for “high-risk hazard zones,” including in and around Portland’s famous Forest Park and in heavily forested wetlands and natural areas across the city. The ban will apply during wildfire season or whenever a county burn ban is in effect. The 8-square-mile Forest Park in the heart of Portland is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S. There have been frequent reports of fires at unsanctioned campsites and at clusters of RVs across the city from illegal burning, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The city stressed that the rule was to prevent fires from starting in the city but also to protect homeless people from blazes started near encampments by others. Nonprofit groups working with the city will visit the camps, provide information about fire risk and help residents relocate voluntarily before any aggressive sweeps take place, the newspaper said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGettysburg: Authorities have announced the arrest of a new suspect in a rape and murder more than three decades ago for which another man served 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by DNA evidence. State police and Adams County prosecutors said Chris Speelman, 58, of New Oxford is charged with criminal homicide, rape, robbery and burglary in the August 1987 slaying of 85-year-old Edna Laughman. Lt. Mark Magyar said the arrest was made possible by advances in genetic genealogy and the hard work of investigators. District Attorney Brian Sinnett said a company analyzing the DNA profile provided by investigators came up with a list of surnames, including Speelman’s, and other information including hair and eye color. Sinnett said Speelman had lived next-door to the victim “within the same structure” about a decade before her murder. A DNA sample provided by him a few months ago was “an absolute match” to the suspect’s DNA, he said. Another man, Barry Laughman, a distant relative of the victim, was convicted in 1988 and served 16 years before he was cleared.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Mayor Jorge Elorza had to be held back from Gov. Dan McKee during a disagreement over a proposed contract for the city’s public school teachers. During a ceremonial lighting of the WaterFire basins along the Providence River to mark the return of the city arts festival on Wednesday, Elorza was seen on video pointing his finger at McKee and yelling, “You’ve got to face the community on this.” Elorza was held back by a member of McKee’s state police security detail. Both men are Democrats. Elorza confirmed after the event he was trying to discuss the teachers contract. He wants the contract made public before the teachers’ union votes on it Friday so the community can have input. The state has taken control of the city’s underperforming schools. “If you believe it’s a transformational contract, stand before the community and tell them why you believe it’s transformational,” Elorza said. “But simply hiding and doing it in secret and wanting to wrap this up before facing the community, that’s not the way that this is supposed to be done.” McKee declined to comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLaurens: Malouf Companies, which warehouses and distributes home furnishings and other consumer products, is investing $47.2 million in a project in Laurens County and will create 240 new jobs, Gov. Henry McMaster’s office said in a news release. “We couldn’t be more excited to congratulate Malouf for its decision to establish its first South Carolina facility in Laurens County. This $47.2 million investment, along with the 240 new jobs it will create, are huge wins for the community, and we look forward to seeing this great company continue to grow,” McMaster said. Malouf’s new facility will increase the company’s warehousing capabilities and improve distribution capacity to meet demand, officials said. The new facility is expected to be operational by Nov. 30. The Coordinating Council for Economic Development has approved a $200,000 Rural Infrastructure Fund grant to Laurens County to assist with site preparation and building improvements.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem barred the state’s Department of Education from applying for federal grants in history or civics over concerns about how certain teachings on systemic racism would be tied to the grants. The U.S. Department of Education this month backed away from proposed grant guidelines that suggested using curricula that teach racism is embedded into the country’s institutions. After releasing proposed rules for the $3 million American History and Civics Education grant program in April that included references to the New York Times’ “1619 Project” and “anti-racism” teaching, the U.S. Department of Education had faced backlash from conservatives, who argued it was an example of critical race theory making its way into elementary and high school classrooms. “Our students should learn America’s true history by studying both our triumphs and our mistakes,” Noem said in a statement. “Only then will students learn that America remains the shining example of exceptionalism throughout the history of the world.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Seven unemployed Tennessee residents have filed a lawsuit over Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to opt out of the federal unemployment benefits programs earlier this year. They said in a federal complaint filed this week against Lee and Department of Labor Commissioner Jeff McCord that they struggle to survive on state unemployment funds as they look for work, news outlets reported. They are asking a federal judge to instruct Lee to reenter the federally funded pandemic unemployment compensation programs run by U.S. Department of Labor. “This program has served as a lifeline for thousands of Tennesseans who remain affected by the pandemic,” Nashville attorneys W. Gary Blackburn and Bryant Kroll wrote. State officials declined to comment on pending litigation. Lee announced in May that Tennessee would withdraw from federal unemployment programs that would pay an additional $300 a week in benefit payments. The state reverted Sunday to benefits through Tennessee’s Unemployment Compensation program, which pays up to $275 a week.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The city announced that Lou Neff Road and all associated parking along the loop around the Zilker Park Great Lawn will remain closed through Aug. 7 and will reopen Aug. 8. The work to realign the road, accommodate ADA improvements, perform asphalt maintenance and make electrical service modifications was scheduled to be finished by Friday, but the asphalt work has been delayed to minimize the impact on park programming. During this road closure, the Austin Parks Foundation is asking Zilker Park visitors to take alternate forms of transportation, including bicycles, ride sharing and public transportation. As parking will be limited during this time, using CapMetro is highly encouraged. The CapMetro 30 Local route goes to Zilker Park via Barton Springs Road.\n\nUtah\n\nHurricane:A missing 4-year-old boy who was found dead in his toy chest died accidently of positional asphyxiation, police said. The search for Kache Wallis of Hurricane began Sunday after his family woke up in the morning and discovered he wasn’t in his bed. Police, family and friends conducted searches inside and outside the house before someone opened the small toy chest and found the boy inside. The Utah Medical Examiner’s Office investigated the cause of death. Police said it was caused by positional asphyxiation, or a lack of air because of the position of a person’s body. The Hurricane Police offered their condolences to the boy’s family.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington:A bridge will be closed for repairs for the next three months between South Burlington and Williston, and the closure is expected to cause traffic delays on other roads, the Vermont Agency of Transportation said. The Muddy Brook Bridge between Kimball Avenue in South Burlington and Marshall Avenue in Williston will be closed starting on Monday, the agency said. Drivers should expect increased traffic on U.S. Route 2 and Vermont Route 2A and additional traffic delays in the area, the agency said. They are encouraged to add extra time to their travel plans or take other routes. The bridge is expected to be closed until November.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials are warning people and pets to avoid swimming or wading in the James River after hundreds of thousands of gallons of sewage spilled from a Goochland County sewer line into a tributary of the river. The Department of Health issued an advisory Thursday after the sewage release from the sewer line into Tuckahoe Creek on Tuesday night, news outlets reported. The Goochland County Department of Public Utilities shut off the pipe less than four hours later, but not before 300,000 gallons of “raw, undiluted sewage” spilled into nearby Tuckahoe Creek. The water advisory applies to Tuckahoe Creek beginning at River Road and the James River from Robious Landing Park in Chesterfield, Goochland, and Henrico counties to Belle Isle in Richmond. Officials warned that swallowing contaminated water from the river could cause gastrointestinal illnesses and that external contact could cause “infections of the ears, nose, throat and skin.” There is no impact on drinking water at this time, officials said. An end date for the advisory will be based on bacteria levels in the water.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three schoolteachers in the state who sued chemical company Monsanto over exposure to materials in fluorescent lights have been awarded $185 million. The law firm that represented the teachers, Friedman Rubin, said a jury returned the verdict Tuesday in King County Superior Court. The teachers, who worked at the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe, said they suffered brain damage from exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the fluorescent lighting at the school. “This is a big step in holding Monsanto accountable,” the teachers’ attorney, Rick Friedman, said in a statement. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, said the company disagreed with the verdict and might appeal. The company said the light ballasts that were the focus of the lawsuit were obsolete. This was the first of 22 trials involving teachers, parents and students who spent time at the Sky Valley Education Center. A 2019 Associated Press investigation found that millions of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs probably remain in schools and day care centers across the U.S. four decades after the chemicals were banned over concerns that they could cause cancer and other illnesses. Many older buildings also have caulk, ceiling tiles, floor adhesives and paint made with PCBs, which sometimes have been found at levels far higher than allowed by law. PCBs are mixtures of compounds manufactured by Monsanto Co. and widely used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned in 1979.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: Workers began repairs this week on West Virginia 2 in Mason County on a slip believed to have been caused by heavy rains earlier this month. Both lanes will be closed from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. beginning Wednesday and running for about four days. Emergency and mail delivery vehicles will be allowed to pass through while both lanes are closed, the Department of Transportation said in a news release. “The area presented a challenge due to the length of the slip,” said Kathy Rushworth, Division of Highways District 1 maintenance engineer. “We gathered information and considered several methods of repair and chose soil nails as the most efficient and effective for the location.” One lane of West Virginia 2 will reopen after the initial closure until repairs are finished in about four weeks. The location is near the Jackson County line.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Strong thunderstorms caused widespread damage across Wisconsin, left tens of thousands without power and triggered tornado warnings. The severe weather stretched from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan and began Wednesday night in northwestern Wisconsin. By 2 a.m. Thursday, the numerous tornado warnings across the state expired. The National Weather Service surveyed hard-hit areas in southeastern Wisconsin and confirmed it was a tornado, probably rated EF1, that caused damage around the Jefferson County community of Concord, where the storm toppled farm buildings and left a path of destruction.

The accident happened Tuesday morning near a carnival area next to the rodeo grounds. The victim, whose identity wasn’t released, was riding in the bed of a full-size pickup that slowed to a stop in traffic, the Cheyenne Police Department said in a statement. The man lost his footing and fell as he was getting out of the truck bed. The driver of the other pickup truck pulled ahead with the flow of traffic and ran over the man, police said. An ambulance took the man to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Frontier Days was back this year after being canceled for the first time in 2020 because of the coronavirus.

Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to assault, among many others.\n\n\"It remains a major problem with our democracy that one can be convicted of a crime – and even be in prison – and win reelection,\" said David Greenberg, a history professor at Rutgers University. \"The White House and Congress were remiss in not passing legislation to address this problem in the last four years.\"\n\n\"It’s important to realize that most of us – no matter our party, no matter our ideology – tend to be forgiving of crimes, scandals, and wrongdoing when committed by a politician we admire for personal or political reasons,\" he added.\n\nHere’s a list of some officeholders who have been found guilty of charges but still won office after.\n\nMarion Barry\n\nBarry was first elected mayor of Washington, D.C., in 1978. He was still serving as mayor in 1990 when he was arrested for smoking crack cocaine in a room at the Vista International Hotel with a friend who worked as an informant for the FBI and D.C. police.\n\nHe was sentenced to six months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. After being released from prison, he was elected to the city council in D.C. in 1992 and won a fourth term as mayor in 1994. He died at the age of 78 in 2014.\n\n\"There is no discounting people's loyalty to a long-time elected official that is revered in their community,\" said Wesley Leckrone, chair of political science at Widener University. \"Years, or even decades, of helping constituents and being viewed as someone who stands up for their community creates a commitment to a candidate. Former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry is a prime example.\"\n\n\"He was seen as pillar of the Black community, a person that stood up for the interests of the poor. In many sections of D.C., constituents believed that he was being framed because of his race. Consequently, he was able to come back after conviction. It also helps when someone represents a one-party, solid blue or red constituency,\" Leckrone added.\n\nGreg Gianforte\n\nGianforte pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2017 after assaulting a reporter on the eve of his election to the House of Representatives. Ben Jacobs, the reporter for the Guardian at the time, said Gianforte body slammed him at a campaign event breaking his glasses. The event was captured with audio recordings and Fox News reporters said they saw Gianforte body slam Jacobs and proceed to punch him.\n\nGianforte apologized to Jacobs. The Montana Republican was sentenced to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. Gianforte was elected to the House, where he served from 2017 to 2021. He’s served as Montana’s governor since 2021.\n\nJoseph Morrissey\n\nJoseph Morrissey, a Virginia independent lawmaker, was re-elected in 2015 to the state’s House of Delegates while serving a six-month jail sentence, according to CNN.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge just a month before the election for an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old underage secretary, the outlet reported. Morrissey campaigned during the day and spent the night behind bars.\n\nKevin Parker\n\nDemocratic New York State Senator Kevin Parker was convicted of misdemeanor criminal mischief charges in 2010 after he allegedly confronted a photographer for the New York Post and damaged the reporter’s equipment.\n\nParker has had other run-ins with the law. In 2005, during his first term, he was charged with assault for punching a traffic agent who gave him a ticket for double-parking. Also in 2005, a former aide accused Parker of threatening her after she publicly complained that he shoved and hit her.\n\nLast year, a lawsuit was filed against Parker accusing him of rape.\n\nDespite his conviction, he’s kept his seat in the state Senate. He has been reelected every two years since and he is running for re-election in 2024.\n\nVito Fossella\n\nVito Fossella, a Republican, was serving in the House representing New York’s 13th Congressional District when he was arrested for drunk driving in May 2008. He later admitted to having fathered a child through an affair and abandoned his re-election bid, citing the “need to concentrate on healing the wounds that I have caused to my wife and family.\"\n\nIn October 2008, Fossella was found guilty of a misdemeanor charge for drunk driving. He was sentenced to five days in prison. Despite his sentence, he still was elected to be Staten Island borough president in 2021.\n\nMatthew Lyon\n\nDuring the Quasi War with France, Matthew Lyon, who represented Vermont in the House, published editorials criticizing President John Adams. He was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, Greenberg said. Lyon was jailed, ran for Congress and was re-elected to the House that same year.\n\nHe won re-election to the House in 1802, representing Kentucky. Afterwards, he won re-election three more times until 1810, where he was defeated in part because of his opposition to the War of 1812, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas.\n\nHow about lawmakers facing indictment or investigation who were re-elected?\n\nAlong with lawmakers who were convicted, there are also lawmakers who were indicted or were involved in an investigation that took office.\n\nFor instance, Democrat John Street, the former mayor of Philadelphia who was elected to his first term beginning in 2000, was the subject of a federal corruption investigation. But he was still re-elected to a second term that started in 2004.\n\nLikewise, former Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., who served in the House from 2011 to 2015, was indicted in 2014 for mail, wire and health care fraud, filing false tax returns, perjury, obstruction of an official proceeding and other charges. Despite the charges, he won re-election in 2014 but later resigned in December that same year after pleading guilty to a tax evasion charge.\n\nMore recently, former Reps. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., and Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who were both facing federal indictments, were re-elected to the House during the 2018 midterm elections. Collins resigned in 2019 ahead of a guilty plea on criminal insider trading charges and Hunter resigned after pleading guilty to a conspiracy to misuse campaign funds.\n\nThere are also lawmakers currently facing indictments who are running in the general election. For example, Bob Menendez, New Jersey's senior senator who is on trial in lower Manhattan on federal corruption charges, is running for re-election as an independent candidate.\n\nWill Trump join this list of lawmakers?\n\nWhether Trump's conviction will harm his re-election bid depends on the mood of the voters. Some polls indicate that voter's views are mostly unchanged and along partly lines.\n\n\"American politics today has really reverted to its historical norm, the kind of polarization that characterized it from its founding until the Cold War, really, where you have two sides that are deeply entrenched and move further and further apart from each other on key philosophical issues,\" said Matthew Schmidt, University of New Haven associate professor of national security and political science.\n\nA CBS poll conducted between May 30 and June 1 found that 82% of Republicans think the jury reached the wrong verdict in Trump's trial while 96% of Democrats think they reached the right verdict. The same poll found 81% of Republicans think Trump is fit to be president while only 2% of Democrats think he is.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between May 31 and June 1 found that Trump’s favorability hasn’t changed much since his conviction. Some 31% of survey respondents had a favorable opinion of Trump, a slight uptick from 29% in a March poll. President Joe Biden’s favorability is in that same range, the poll found, with 32% favorability now compared with 33% in March.\n\n\"When he finds himself in legal trouble, he claims that it is political persecution,\" Leckrone said, referring to Trump. \"His supporters believe this because they buy the narrative that 'the establishment' is trying to bring him down since he's challenging them... His core constituency appreciates this sentiment and it actually endears him to them even more.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/why-liz-cheney-lost", "title": "How Liz Cheney lost Wyoming's lone seat in the House | CNN Politics", "text": "Jackson, Wyoming CNN —\n\nRep. Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”\n\n“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/omarosa-trump-ethics-case-ruling", "title": "Omarosa Manigault Newman ordered by judge to pay more than ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA federal judge has ruled against former Trump administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman and ordered her to pay more than $60,000, in a lawsuit the Justice Department brought against her after then-President Donald Trump fired his former apprentice.\n\nThe case found that Manigault Newman hadn’t complied with federal ethics requirements that public officials file financial disclosures when they leave a government job.\n\nThough it revolved around a compliance matter, over the last few years, Manigault Newman’s departure and litigation spun into a juicy drama between the powers of the Trump White House and a combatant, well-known personality once in its fold.\n\nShe had been director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison in Trump’s White House. But Trump fired her in December 2017, less than a year after he took office as president. (Trump had fired her previously, on the first season of “The Apprentice.”)\n\nSince then, Manigault Newman has been publicly critical of Trump, calling him a racist, releasing tapes she recorded in his administration and writing a book about him titled “Unhinged.”\n\nOn Twitter on Tuesday, following the ruling, Manigault Newman again criticized Trump.\n\n“The question remains… are there two systems of justice in this country. One that allows those who violate the Hatch Act and Emoluments Clause a slap on wrist and the other that orders an unprecedented fine (highest in history) for an alleged unintentional failing to file a form?” she wrote.\n\nAfter Manigault Newman left the White House, administration attorneys reminded her repeatedly that she hadn’t filed her final financial disclosure. Manigault Newman did not make the filings.\n\nShe claimed, according to the court filings, that the White House had her last day wrong, and she told the court that the Trump administration held hostage boxes of her belongings and other files that she needed.\n\nStill, the judge, Richard Leon of the DC District Court, found Manigault-Newman liable for a $61,585 civil penalty and ordered her to pay the fee to the US Treasury within a month. That amount is the maximum $50,000 penalty for the violation, plus inflation.\n\n“Manigault Newman willfully violated the [Ethics in Government Act],” Leon wrote in a 15-page opinion on Tuesday. The judge noted Manigault Newman was “well aware of her obligation” to make her final disclosures and had “received countless reminders.”\n\n“This conduct establishes a willful violation,” the judge added.\n\nLeon also decided Manigault Newman, one of the most well-known faces from Trump’s era as a reality TV honcho who has kept a public persona since her breakout 18 years ago, would have ample funds to make the payment.\n\nShe made a salary of $179,700 in her White House post and is a partial beneficiary of a million-dollar trust, the judge said.\n\nHer attorney, John Phillips, told CNN on Tuesday that his client may appeal and criticized the Biden administration for continuing to pursue the case. “They played games with the system,” Phillips said, adding that now-Attorney General Merrick Garland “is supposed to be returning stability and reason back to government.

I don’t want to hear something like that.”\n\nPeople who knew DePape in California described him as an odd character.\n\nA 2013 article in the San Francisco Chronicle identified him as a “hemp jewelry maker,” and said that he lived with a nudist activist. Other photos published by the Chronicle show DePape – fully clothed – at a nude wedding on the steps of San Francisco City Hall.\n\nLinda Schneider, a California resident, told CNN she got to know DePape roughly eight years ago and that he occasionally housesat for her. When they met, she said, DePape was living in a storage unit in the Berkeley area and told her he had been struggling with hard drugs but was “trying to create a new life for himself.”\n\nShe said that he was extremely shy. “He said he couldn’t even go and have a bank account because he was terrified of speaking to a teller,” Schneider said.\n\nBut Schneider later received “really disturbing” emails from DePape in which he sounded like a “megalomaniac and so out of touch with reality,” she said. She said she stopped communicating with him “because it seemed so dangerous,” adding that she recalled him “using Biblical justification to do harm.”\n\nDePape’s social media presence similarly paints a picture of someone on a worrying trajectory, falling into conspiracy theories in recent years.\n\nLast year, David DePape posted links on his Facebook page to multiple videos produced by My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell falsely alleging that the 2020 election was stolen. Other posts included transphobic images and linked to websites claiming Covid vaccines were deadly. “The death rates being promoted are what ever ‘THEY’ want to be promoted as the death rate,” one post read.\n\nDePape also posted links to YouTube videos with titles like “Democrat FARCE Commission to Investigate January 6th Capitol Riot COLLAPSES in Congress!!!” and “Global Elites Plan To Take Control Of YOUR Money! (Revealed)”\n\nTwo days after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of killing George Floyd, DePape wrote that the trial was “a modern lynching,” falsely indicating that Floyd died of a drug overdose.\n\nHe also posted content about the “Great Reset”– the sprawling conspiracy theory that global elites are using coronavirus to usher in a new world order in which they gain more power and oppress the masses. And he complained that politicians making promises to try to win votes “are offering you bribes in exchange for your further enslavement.”\n\nMost of the public posts on DePape’s Facebook page were from 2021. In earlier years, DePape also posted long screeds about religion, including claims that “Jesus is the anti christ.” None of the public posts appeared to mention Pelosi.\n\nBlogs show images of Pelosi, Qanon and antisemitism\n\nMore recently, two other blogs written by someone with the username “daviddepape” have posted content similar to that on DePape’s Facebook page.\n\nIn a string of posts on a Wordpress.com blog over the course of several days in August 2022, the author complained about big tech censorship and posted statements like “Hitlery did nothing wrong.” The site has since been taken offline.\n\nAnd another blog, also attributed to “daviddepape,” featured antisemitic screeds and content linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. One video posted on the site includes a shot of Pelosi swinging a gavel during one of former President Donald Trump’s impeachments, and another video includes an image of Pelosi and other politicians. A third video includes a clip of Pelosi speaking on the House floor.\n\nOther posts from the last few weeks featured videos accusing LGBTQ people of “grooming” children, and declared that “any journalist saying” there is no evidence of election fraud “should be dragged straight out into the street and shot.” The most recent post – linking to a YouTube video comparing colleges to cults – went up the day before the Pelosi attack.\n\nCNN was not able to confirm that the two blogs were written by DePape.\n\nAnother former acquaintance of DePape’s also told CNN he exhibited concerning behavior over the years.\n\nLaura Hayes, who also lives in California, said she worked with DePape for a few months roughly a decade ago making hemp bracelets when he was living in a storage shed in the Berkeley area. She said DePape sold the bracelets as a business.\n\n“He was very odd. He didn’t make eye contact very well,” Hayes said.

Vance tests Donald Trump's influence in Ohio Senate primary ...", "text": "Grove City, Ohio CNN —\n\nJ.D. Vance’s bid for the Ohio Republican Senate nomination has turned into the clearest early test in this year’s midterm elections of former President Donald Trump’s influence over the candidates whom GOP primary voters back and the policies that animate the party.\n\nTrump plucked Vance from a pack of better-polling rivals, hoping that his endorsement of the venture capitalist, whose memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” became a Netflix movie, would be enough to carry the candidate through the wide-open May 3 primary to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman.\n\nVance possesses a ready-for-television personality and an ease at the microphone that shines through in debates and stump speeches. He has never run for office before, so he holds none of the baggage that leading rival Josh Mandel, the former Ohio treasurer with an appetite for divisive cultural debates, carries from previous losses. Mirroring Trump, Vance frequently breaks from the business-aligned interests that have long dominated conservative politics and is eager to engage in fights over Big Tech, border security and more.\n\nVance’s liabilities – largely that he can be found on video lambasting many of the same politicians and policies he now embraces – mirror those that Trump once faced.\n\nRivals are attempting to exploit those old remarks, including Vance’s 2016 suggestion that he might vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump. Some Republican officials who worked to help the former President win Ohio then say they see Trump’s endorsement of Vance as a betrayal, while Democratic strategists say that if Vance advances to the general election, where he will likely face Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, they will seek to portray him as inauthentic.\n\nGOP Senate hopeful Mike Gibbons, the businessman who has largely self-funded his campaign, said Trump’s decision to endorse Vance left other candidates an opening that would not have existed had the former President backed someone who had been more loyal to his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.\n\n“My first choice was that he endorse me. Our second choice was that he would stay out. And our third choice was that he would endorse J.D. Vance,” Gibbons said in an interview.\n\nBut Vance has the one thing that might matter most to Republicans voting in next week’s primary: forgiveness from Trump.\n\n“He’s the guy that said some bad s— about me. He did,” Trump said at a rally last week at the Delaware County Fairgrounds, north of Columbus. “But you know what? Every one of the others did also. In fact, if I went by that standard, I don’t think I’d have ever endorsed anyone in the country.”\n\nUltimately, Trump said, “I want to pick somebody that’s going to win, and this man is going to win.”\n\nSo far, Trump’s endorsement appears to have translated into a boost for Vance. A Fox News poll released Tuesday showed he had edged into the lead, with 23% support among GOP primary voters, 5 points ahead of Mandel, who is campaigning with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the race’s closing weekend.\n\nThey were followed, according to the survey, by Gibbons at 13%; state Sen. Matt Dolan, the only candidate who has not embraced Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud in 2020, at 11%; and former state GOP chair Jane Timken at 6%.\n\nStill, the primary battle is fluid: A quarter of those likely to vote in the Republican primary were undecided, the poll found. Strategists expect low turnout, in part because a delay in finalizing redistricting for the state legislature means Ohio has to hold two primaries this year. And establishment-leaning Republicans backing Gov. Mike DeWine against a challenge from the right might not be inclined to follow Trump’s lead.\n\n“Some voters still don’t know when the primary is, and it’s going to confuse people,” Steve Stivers, a former GOP congressman who resigned last year to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the race, Stivers said the support from Trump offered an unquestionable boost for Vance. But he said Vance remains an unknown figure to many Ohio voters because he has not run for office before and spent years living outside the state.\n\n“He wasn’t really a contender before the Trump endorsement,” Stivers said. “He’s absolutely a new figure. A lot of people don’t know him because he’s not been engaged in the party politics very long.”\n\n‘I can support him now’\n\nWhile Vance moved quickly to magnify Trump’s endorsement through TV ads – a sign he is counting on the former President’s loyal followers to pull him across the finish line – he barely mentioned it during a campaign stop Wednesday here in Grove City.\n\nTo a lunchtime crowd of about 50 people in the central Ohio town, Vance spent far more time delivering a pointed critique of President Joe Biden than touting his support from Trump.\n\n“What’s wrong with this country is not rocket science,” Vance said. “It’s bad leadership.”\n\nHis remarks also made clear that he believes he still must address lingering concerns about his previous criticism of Trump – which has been amplified by millions of dollars in TV ads from the Club for Growth in its quest to defeat Vance. (The Club is supporting Mandel.)\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen all these advertisements accusing me of being a ‘Never Trumper,’ Vance said, speaking to a hushed room. “I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t like Donald Trump in 2016 – like a lot of Republicans didn’t love Donald Trump in 2016. The difference between me and them is that I’ve actually had the honesty to admit that I was wrong.”\n\nHe added, “Amazingly in politics, just admit you were wrong, it’s that simple.”\n\nThe remarks drew tepid applause, but several voters said later they were pleased Vance had confronted one of the biggest questions hanging over his candidacy.\n\n“I couldn’t in good faith vote for him because of things he said against Trump,” said Bonnie Boyd of Columbus, who came to take her own measure of Vance before voting next week.\n\nShe said she was most offended by Vance’s comment in 2016 that he would consider voting for Clinton over Trump. “That probably hurt the most,” Boyd said.\n\nBut “when Trump endorsed him,” she said, “I thought I can support him now.”\n\nFor Trump, the Vance endorsement offers one of the biggest tests yet of his grip over the GOP base. Several Republicans who came to see Vance on Wednesday disagreed with Boyd, saying they intended to make up their own minds in the Ohio primary.\n\n“I’m not making my decision based on Trump’s choice,” said Janet Riegel of Grove City, a retired librarian who is still undecided in the race. “I’m basing my decision on what J.D. Vance and all of the candidates stand for.”\n\nSeveral Republican voters and party officials across Ohio said in interviews this week that the Trump endorsement has unquestionably upended the race and given Vance a lifeline in the final stretch of campaigning. But it remained an open question whether it would be enough to deliver a victory.\n\n“He still has to show that he is his own man and can win this race,” a Republican lawmaker who is neutral in the contest told CNN. “But for the others, it stung.”\n\nAnd that, one Vance adviser said, is precisely why he is not loudly trumpeting the endorsement as he still works to introduce himself to voters – as a “new generation Republican.”\n\n“This is the fight that we’re having – not just are we going to beat the Democrats, but what kind of Republican are we going to send to Washington?” Vance said in Grove City. “The problem that we have in Washington right now is that we have very, very many weak Republicans who are terrible at fighting back against the left.”\n\nProxy battle over GOP’s direction\n\nWhile a super PAC funded by pro-Trump tech mogul Peter Thiel boosts Vance through television ads, the candidate is fully aligning himself with Trump world and its acolytes. He has held several events in recent days with the former President’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and plans to campaign over the primary’s closing weekend with Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe other leading Republican candidates have their own surrogates. Cruz is campaigning with Mandel, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has endorsed Gibbons. Timken hired two top Trump allies, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, as strategists, and has appeared with Lewandowski at events.\n\nThe most significant split is between Trump and David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, which has long been one of the biggest financial players in GOP primaries and has largely supported Trump-endorsed candidates.\n\nIn Ohio, the group’s political arm, Club for Growth Action, is airing ads highlighting Vance’s previous criticism of Trump, questioning whether Trump is fully aware of Vance’s words and even tweaking the former President for his past endorsement of Mitt Romney’s Senate candidacy.\n\nFurious about the ads, Trump ordered an intermediary to send McIntosh a text last week that read: “Go f— yourself.”\n\nVance’s most significant recent stumble has been his early comments about Ukraine, as Russia prepared to launch its invasion.\n\n“I got to be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine, one way or the other,” Vance said on former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast in February.\n\nDays later, once the gravity of the war unfolding in Ukraine was more clear, Vance backtracked. He issued a lengthy statement, saying that Russia’s war was “unquestionably a tragedy, especially for the innocent people caught in the crossfire,” while also opposing any US or NATO military intervention.\n\nLast week, Dolan highlighted Vance’s early remarks about Ukraine in a digital video, noting that Ohio is home to 80,000 people with ties to Ukraine.\n\nThere are some signs in recent days that Dolan is emerging as a serious threat to Vance.\n\nThe state senator whose family owns baseball’s Cleveland Guardians has largely sought to stay above the fray. Most of the attention he has received in the race has been for his rejection of Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential race. But Dolan also frequently points out that, as a state lawmaker, he has helped enact policies that fit into Trump’s agenda.\n\nBy appealing to moderates and establishment Republicans and eschewing Trumpism, Dolan has perhaps the clearest lane in the fractured primary field.\n\nAnd Trump seems to recognize this. The former President in a statement this week attacked Dolan over the Guardians’ decision last year to change their name from the Cleveland Indians.\n\n“Anybody who changes the name of the “storied” Cleveland Indians (from 1916), an original baseball franchise, to the Cleveland Guardians, is not fit to serve in the United States Senate,” Trump said Tuesday. “Such is the case for Matt Dolan, who I don’t know, have never met, and may be a very nice guy, but the team will always remain the Cleveland Indians to me!”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/us/bernie-madoff-sister-husband-die/index.html", "title": "Bernie Madoff's sister and her husband dead in apparent murder ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe sister of infamous Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and her husband have been found dead in an apparent murder-suicide, according to a news release from Florida police.\n\nDeputies who responded to a 911 call found 87-year-old Sondra Wiener and her 90-year-old husband Marvin dead from gunshot wounds in their Boynton Beach, Florida home on Thursday, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office said in the release Sunday.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bernie Madoff, infamous Ponzi schemer, dead at 82 03:11 - Source: CNNBusiness Bernie Madoff, infamous Ponzi schemer, dead at 82 03:11 • CNNBusiness\n\n“Detectives from the Violent Crimes Division arrived on scene to investigate further.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/europe/pope-francis-interview-ukraine-abuse-intl/index.html", "title": "Pope Francis declares 'zero tolerance' for Catholic Church abuse ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Francis says he has taken it on himself to rid the Catholic Church of sexual abuse, telling CNN’s partner channel CNN Portugal that he was “responsible that it doesn’t happen anymore.”\n\nIn an exclusive, wide-ranging interview in Rome last month, the Pontiff said the church had “zero tolerance” for abuse and said that “a priest cannot remain a priest if he is an abuser.”\n\nThe church’s response to sex abuse scandals has become one of the defining themes of Francis’ time as Pope, and he told CNN Portugal that every case of abuse within the church “hurts” him.\n\nMultiple reports detailing decades of sexual abuse, systemic failures and cover-ups across multiple countries have been released since Francis became the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics in 2013. While he was criticized for some of his actions – such as when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up a sex scandal in 2018, a decision he later described as a “grave error” – he has since taken a firm stance on the issues and introduced some reforms.\n\nIn 2019, he abolished Vatican secrecy rules for cases of sexual abuse and put in place new rules that made it mandatory for the first time for all dioceses to set up systems for reporting abuse and cover-ups.\n\nTwo years later, he issued the most extensive revision to Catholic Church law in four decades, insisting that bishops take action against clerics who abuse minors and vulnerable adults. The rules also demanded action against priests who commit fraud or attempt to ordain women.\n\nAddressing the topic, Francis said he didn’t believe celibacy played a role in causing the abuse.\n\n“I don’t deny the abuse. Even if it was only one [case], it is monstrous. Because you, priest, you, nun, have to take that boy, that girl to God and with this you destroy their lives. It’s monstrous. It is destroying lives. And then they come to you with questions. Could it be that celibacy [is to blame]? It’s not about celibacy,” he said.\n\n“This is one thing about abuse, it is a destructive thing, humanly diabolical,” he said. “In families there is no celibacy and all that and, sometimes, it happens. So, it is simply the monstrosity of a man or woman of the church who is psychologically ill or evil and uses their position for their personal satisfaction,” he added.\n\nThe Pope also revealed that he has been in contact with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to him on the phone.\n\nHe said he has in the past met both Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin when they visited him in Rome. But when asked what he could tell the two, the Pope said: “I don’t know.\n\n“I had a dialogue with both [of them]. They both visited me here before the war. And I always believe that in dialogue we always move forward,” the Pope said. “You know who doesn’t know how to talk? Animals. They are pure instinct.”\n\nFrancis has been criticized for some of his comments about Russia’s war on Ukraine. In a June interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa, Francis said the war “was perhaps in some way either provoked or not prevented.” He said that before Russia invaded Ukraine he met with “a head of state” who “was very worried about how NATO was moving.”\n\nLast month, the Pope angered Kyiv by referring to Russian political commentator Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist philosopher, as being among the “innocent” victims of the war after she was killed by a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Apostolic Nuncio to Ukraine, Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas, to discuss Francis’ statement, saying that it “unjustly” equates “the aggressor and the victim.”\n\nThe Pope, who has previously indicated he would be willing to travel to Kyiv and Moscow, told CNN Portugal such a visit was “up in the air.”\n\nNo Pope has ever traveled to Moscow before. Pope John Paul II traveled to Ukraine in 2001.\n\nHe said he was unable to travel at the moment because of issues with his knee, but said that his presence in Ukraine was “strong” because he sent several cardinals to Kyiv to represent him.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter and fired its top executives ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, a source familiar with the deal told CNN Thursday, putting the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/voting-rights-texas-election-what-matters", "title": "The new Texas voting law is not going well | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe are now starting to learn how a raft of new election laws will actually affect voters.\n\nNew laws, passed by GOP-controlled legislatures under the guise of securing elections in multiple states, will lead to fewer people voting if Texas foreshadows what will happen in other states.\n\nEarly voting kicked off in Texas on Monday for US congressional seats, governor and six other statewide offices.\n\nCNN’s Fredreka Schouten talked to people who tried and failed, more than once, to get and cast an absentee ballot.\n\nHer report has an ominous headline: “Faulty ballots and frustration: Texans confront ‘nightmare’ effects of new election law as early voting kicks off.”\n\nFirst try. Schouten talks to a Houston-area retiree, Pam Gaskin, whose first attempt to get an absentee ballot was rejected because the paperwork she downloaded from her county’s website was outdated.\n\nSecond try. Gaskin’s second attempt was rejected because the driver’s license number she provided didn’t match the ID she used 46 years ago, the first time she registered to vote in Fort Bend County.\n\n“I am mad as hell,” said Gaskin, who grew up watching her father pay poll taxes for himself and other African Americans in Galveston County so they could vote. “These are the things we fought 60 years ago, 50 years ago, and we are still fighting them. And that is not right.”\n\nWho else will try three times? Gaskin, a League of Women Voters member and an active voter for years, did ultimately get her absentee ballot on the third try and after nearly a month of effort. But she worries a lot of people will give up or run out of time.\n\n“I have a degree in English from the University of Texas at Austin,” Gaskin told Schouten. “I know how to read and follow directions, and I’m determined. I’m convinced that a lot of people who get these rejection letters will just give up.”\n\nGaskin’s experience is the opposite of what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott promised the new law would accomplish.\n\n“It does make it easier than ever before for anybody to go cast a ballot,” Abbott, a Republican, said last September. “It does also, however, make sure it is harder than ever for people to cheat at the ballot box.”\n\nMuch of the law seemed targeted at the Democratic stronghold of Harris County, which includes Houston. Some of the key elements in addition to the new ID requirements:\n\nLimiting voting hours (Harris County instituted 24-hour voting in 2020).\n\nBanning drive-thru voting.\n\nMaking it a crime for public officials to send absentee ballots applications to voters who haven’t specifically requested them.\n\nTexas already restricts access to mail-in voting to those 65 and older, the sick and disabled, and those who are out of their home county during in-person voting.\n\nStill, there were nearly 1 million absentee voters – less than 10% of ballots cast – in 2020.\n\nKey line from Schouten. “The changes already have resulted in higher-than-usual rejection rates for absentee ballot applications. And some counties have begun to report new problems: Hundreds of mailed ballots flagged for rejection over ID requirements,” she writes.\n\nSchouten and CNN’s Kelly Mena have begun a weekly newsletter tied to CITIZEN, CNN’s citizen engagement series. It’s weekly and will focus on voting rights. Sign up here.\n\nNew laws across the country. There will be a lot of material for Mena and Schouten to cover. Last year, 19 states passed laws to restrict access to the ballot box in some way, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.\n\nWhat’s the effect of all of this? It’s difficult to say how many people might not vote as a result of these laws. Georgia voters already cast ballots under its new voting law for municipal elections in November.\n\nComparing those elections, in which about 35,000 voters requested mail-in ballots, with the 2020 presidential election, in which nearly 1.8 million Georgians cast mail-in ballots, is difficult – to say the least.\n\nThe publication Mother Jones tried. Using data from the Georgia secretary of state’s office, it reported that about 7% of Georgians who requested a mail-in ballot ended up not voting in 2020. In 2021, for the municipal elections, that figure was 18%, including 4% who had either their mail application or ballot rejected. Those percentages are small, but the margin of victory in Georgia for the presidential race in 2020 was 11,779 of nearly 5 million votes cast. Margins matter.\n\nA different kind of election security. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called on state legislators to provide more security for poll workers and election officials throughout voting during the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nGeorgia, he said on Monday, “has become center of the election universe” and “this year, we are going to have hard fought campaigns that are going to be watched all across the country.”\n\n“With that environment, it only makes sense to provide additional resources for election security so that everyone can have confidence in the results,” Raffensperger said.\n\nThe other important thing to watch in Texas right now are the primaries themselves.\n\nA Democratic primary. CNN’s Greg Krieg writes about how the Bernie Sanders/Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of the party is actively trying to root out some of the most moderate members.\n\nFrom Krieg’s report: Jessica Cisneros fell narrowly short of defeating moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar “in a 2020 primary decided by fewer than 3,000 votes. Cuellar, who has represented the district since 2005, is an aggressive critic of the progressive left and last remaining Democrat in the House who has consistently voted against abortion rights.”\n\nCisneros has the backing of Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for her this weekend in Texas. Cuellar was also the subject of a mysterious FBI raid of his home and campaign office in Laredo. It’s not clear what the FBI was after, but Cuellar said the investigation will show no wrongdoing on his part.\n\nWhat’s on the Republican radar in Texas? I asked CNN’s deputy political director, Terence Burlij, what to watch on the Republican side, and he pointed at the crowded GOP primary for Texas attorney general.\n\nIncumbent Ken Paxton is seeking a third term and has secured the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. But the embattled Paxton is being challenged by state land commissioner George P. Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert.\n\nThat is a serious cast of characters.\n\nPaxton is the state attorney general who led the failed effort among Republicans to challenge the 2020 election results in federal courts, essentially on Trump’s behalf. But he’s under indictment for securities fraud and has other baggage. Read more.\n\nGeorge P. Bush is the nephew and grandson of former presidents frequently criticized by Trump. But despite that – and Trump’s belittling of his father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – George P. has sought Trump’s blessing in previous contests.\n\nGohmert is among the most loyal Trump supporters on Capitol Hill and one who has downplayed the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nGuzman is a former Texas Supreme Court justice.\n\nAll three are highlighting Paxton’s many controversies and his legal issues.\n\nAs Burlij wrote in an email, “The 2022 primary calendar is full of Republican contests that will demonstrate how much sway former President Trump still holds inside the GOP, with the race for Texas attorney general offering the first test of the potential power of his endorsement in this year’s midterm elections.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time, chimpanzees were spotted capturing insects and applying them to their own wounds, as well as the wounds of others, possibly as a form of medication.\n\nThis behavior of one animal applying medication to the wounds of another has never been observed before, and it may be a sign of helpful tendencies in chimpanzees similar to empathy in humans, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers witnessed multiple instances of this behavior within a community of about 45 chimpanzees at the Loango National Park in Gabon, as part of the Ozouga Chimpanzee Project.\n\nThe goal of the project, led by primatologist Tobias Deschner and cognitive biologist Simone Pika, is to study the relationships and interactions between the chimps as well as how they hunt, use tools, communicate and flex their cognitive skills. The findings published Monday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nBears, elephants and even bees have been known to self-medicate against parasites and illness.\n\n“Self-medication — where individuals use plant parts or non-nutritional substances to combat pathogens or parasites — has been observed across multiple animal species including insects, reptiles, birds and mammals,” said Pika, study author and professor of comparative biocognition, at the University of Osnabrück’s Institute of Cognitive Science in Germany, in a statement.\n\n“Our two closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, for instance, swallow leaves of plants with anthelmintic (antiparasitic) properties and chew bitter leaves that have chemical properties to kill intestinal parasites.”\n\nBut this is the first recorded instance of animals applying other animal matter – the insects – to open wounds.\n\n“Chimpanzees eat insects but we did not know that they catch and use them to treat their wounds,” Pika said. “Hence, they not only have an understanding of their food species (plants, insects, monkeys, birds, reptiles) but probably also about characteristics of other animal species that help to act against injuries.”\n\nCare in a chimpanzee community\n\nThe discovery was initially made when project volunteer Alessandra Mascaro watched an interaction between a mother chimp, Suzee, and her son Sia, in 2019. Sia had an injured foot, and Suzee appeared to be tending to it.\n\n“I noticed that she appeared to have something between her lips that she then applied to the wound on Sia’s foot,” Mascaro said in a statement. “Later that evening, I re-watched my videos and saw that Suzee had first reached out to catch something which she put between her lips and then directly onto the open wound on Sia’s foot.”\n\nAbout a week later, it happened again when doctoral student Lara Southern watched adult male chimp Freddy doing something similar. The team surmised that the chimps were capturing tiny flying insects from the air.\n\nOver the next year, the researchers closely watched and filmed all of the chimps that showed signs of injury and recorded 22 chimps applying insects to their own wounds.\n\nThen, Southern witnessed chimps tending to each other.\n\n“An adult male, Littlegrey, had a deep open wound on his shin, and Carol, an adult female, who had been grooming him, suddenly reached out to catch an insect,” Southern said in a statement. “What struck me most was that she handed it to Littlegrey, he applied it to his wound and subsequently Carol and two other adult chimpanzees also touched the wound and moved the insect on it. The three unrelated chimpanzees seemed to perform these behaviours solely for the benefit of their group member.”\n\nThis happened again when another adult male also tended to Littlegrey’s thumb about four months later.\n\nThe team cataloged 76 cases of chimps using insects on their wounds and the wounds of others over 15 months, from November 2019 to February 2021.\n\nHelping one another\n\nTending to others is prosocial, or positive behavior that is in the interest of helping others – something that isn’t often observed in animals.\n\n“This is, for me, especially breathtaking because so many people doubt prosocial abilities in other animals,” Pika said. “Suddenly we have a species where we really see individuals caring for others.”\n\n“Prosocial behaviours have long posed a problem for evolutionary theory, because it was not immediately clear why organisms might help others in the face of selection operating in the interest of self,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nIt’s difficult to say if what the chimps are doing is motivated by empathy, but the researchers were surprised to see that the chimps recognized that how they treat their own wounds can be applied to others and helped one another even if they weren’t related.\n\n“We do not know whether the observed behavior involves empathy,” Pika said. “We know that it may qualify as prosocial behaviour, meaning it may increase the welfare of another animal – feeling better via the social attention and caring, or via substances in the saliva-insect mix that may be soothing or anti-inflammatory. There are examples of chimpanzees adopting and rescuing other chimpanzees, which may involve empathy.”\n\nChimpanzees have long shown that they benefit from cooperation when taking on activities like territorial patrols or hunting, but researchers remain divided on if chimpanzees can be considered proscial or empathetic.\n\n“Our observations may add another facet to the ongoing debate on prosocial behaviors and inspire future studies investigating the behaviours surrounding wound care and the potential medicative function of insect-application,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIt’s possible that the insects the chimps are using have antiseptic or anti-inflammatory properties to soothe the pain of their injuries and promote healing. There is a long history of humans using insects for these same purposes dating back to 1,400 BC, the researchers said. They also can’t rule out that this is potentially more of a placebo effect.\n\nPrevious research has shown that some behaviors in chimpanzees, like using tools, is a learned behavior. Perhaps medicating and helping others is one of those practices passed among the group, too.\n\nNext, the Ozouga researchers wants to identify the insects the chimps are using and closely follow which of the animals seem motivated to help others in their community. They also want to study the insects to see if they have any pharmaceutical properties and determine if the use of the insects helped heal the wounds.\n\n“It is just fascinating to see that after decades of research on wild chimpanzees they still surprise us with unexpected new behaviours,” Deschner said in a statement. “Our study shows that there is still a lot to explore and discover about our closest living relatives, and we therefore need to still put much more effort into protecting them in their natural habitat.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/15/mountain-pine-beetle-emerald-ash-borer-and-more-spread-in-colorado-2023/72947175007/", "title": "Mountain pine beetle, emerald ash borer and more spread in ...", "text": "The Colorado State Forest Service and its federal counterpart flew over 36.6 million acres of the state’s forests in 2023 to assess its health.

A total of 149 injuries were documented, according to the study.\n\nMost of the whales had four or fewer vessel strike injuries. Seven whales had at least three vessel-strike injuries, and two whales had at least four injuries.\n\nIn most cases, researchers could not determine whether multiple injuries in different parts of the whale’s body were caused by one or more strike.\n\nBut at least one whale calf appeared to have injuries from two separate events, based on fresh marks in different body regions within weeks of when the calf was photographed with initial healing wounds.\n\nWhatever the actual total or frequency of injury, researchers and activists agree that whale-boat collisions can be catastrophic.\n\nThe Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC), a charity dedicated to protecting the animals, maintains that people can be injured or killed from being thrown when the small vessel is struck by a whale. Some collisions have caused small vessels to sink.\n\nIf whales are struck in certain areas by a large vessel, they are unlikely to survive, according to the WDC.\n\nOther studies have determined that vessel strikes probably occur because whales, in general, are slow swimmers, spend considerable time at the surface of the water, and stay in areas that tend to overlap with heavy shipping traffic.\n\nCertain types of whales, such as humpbacks, are either unable or unlikely to detect oncoming ships. They may be engaged in activities such as feeding and mating and are either oblivious to, or may not respond to approaching ships.\n\nResearchers for the Gulf of Maine study point out that, while humpback whales are listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, there are no regulations or guidelines in place to reduce the likelihood of collisions with vessels in their vicinity — except those actively engaged in whale watching.\n\nThey hope that their research, and other long-term studies, can help regulators develop new guidelines on boat traffic, and better assess the health of the humpback whale population.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2023/01/19/right-whale-calf-known-massachusetts-seen-entangled-north-carolina/69804107007/", "title": "Right whale calf known in Massachusetts seen entangled off Carolinas", "text": "One step forward, two steps back.\n\nThat is the ongoing plight of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, put into sharp focus this month as scientists reported a juvenile female's dangerous entanglement even as her mother bore a new calf.\n\nWith the North Atlantic right whale calving season now peaking in warmer waters off Georgia, marine scientists are eagerly counting each new addition to the population, since each one represents hope for moving the species further away from the precipice of extinction.\n\nSo it is no small measure of disheartenment that comes with the severe entanglement of a 4-year-old female identified in the North Atlantic right whale catalog as #4904. She is the daughter of a whale named Spindle, estimated to be at least 41 years old and recently seen off Georgia with her 10th known calf.\n\nSpindle's daughter was first spotted Jan. 8 off the coast of North Carolina by an aerial survey team from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, \"heavily entangled\" in fishing gear. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the young whale has sustained severe injuries as a result and they fear she may not survive.\n\n\"There were several wraps of line around the mouth and tail, with additional line trailing behind the whale,\" the agency reported, also detailing \"numerous wounds across her body and whale lice on her head.\" While all whales may have lice, a large number of them on an individual indicates a failing animal.\n\nThe juvenile was last seen in Massachusetts Bay in May 2022, and was not entangled at that time.\n\n\"It's discouraging and frustrating to see yet another North Atlantic right whale entangled in fishing gear,\" said Gib Brogan, fisheries campaign manager at Oceana, an advocacy group that works to protect and restore the oceans by pressing for improved ocean management policies affecting fisheries, seafood, habitat protection and pollution. \"This entanglement is the result of continued mismanagement of this risk. Anywhere that whales and rope intersect, deadly entanglements can occur.\"\n\nBrogan and other advocates for the whales said the federal government needs \"to adopt proven safeguards that will eliminate entanglement risk in times and places where right whales swim.\" The entangled juvenile's struggle, scientists say, highlights the need to accelerate transition to ropeless or “on-demand” fishing gear.\n\nThat effort is already well underway in Massachusetts, where conservation methods the fishing community has adopted and is continuing to incorporate have been a help to the whales. The Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association noted that Massachusetts commercial lobstermen have already helped to reduce risk to right whales by 92%. Over the last five years, the association has collaborated with the Massachusetts Lobster Foundation, and Ketcham Trap of New Bedford to develop weaker red and candy cane rope that will break at 1,700 pounds.\n\nAccording to the organization, commercial lobstermen in Massachusetts have been fishing with the weakened rope for four years now without many issues. The association is continuing to work with Ketcham Trap on the gear. The Massachusetts Environmental Trust's Drive For A Better Environment program has provided money to further Massachusetts commercial lobstermen’s conservation efforts on behalf of right whales and all whale species.\n\nEvery loss is a tragic one for North Atlantic right whales\n\nFor the North Atlantic right whale population, every loss of an individual is a significant one, though there is added concern whenever a female is lost.\n\nAccording to a report released in the fall by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, only about 340 of the animals — plus or minus seven — remained during 2021. Of those, only about 72 of them are reproductively active females.\n\nCharles \"Stormy\" Mayo, director of the right whale ecology program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, has pointed out that this equates to very low calving rates.\n\nAdding to the concern is that females who are giving birth are doing so at greater intervals. Instead of a calving interval of three years, the trend is now closer to six to 10 years. Right whales gestate for a little longer than a year, but they don't actually reach reproductive age until they are about 10 years old. That becomes troublesome, as well, when the whales are likely to die as a result of entanglement and vessel strike injuries before they can reach that age.\n\nPhilip Hamilton, senior scientist and interim chairman of the Kraus Marine Mammal Conservation program at the New England Aquarium, said the situation with Spindle, her new calf, and her entangled daughter highlights the whales' position between opposite ends of a spectrum, from hope to setback.\n\nSpindle, he said, is the most productive mother known, having birthed at least 10 calves in her lifetime, but the possibility of losing even one of her calves, especially a female, has a significant negative impact on recovery of the species. Reproductive females may produce more than 20 progeny, including calves and all related to them, according to Hamilton. If she survives to reproductive age, Spindle's daughter could increase the population by 6 percent.\n\nNew calves born, but not enough\n\nAt this point in the year, the calving season is around its peak. So far, said Mayo, \"we've had 11 calves that have been born.\"\n\nSadly, though, one of the newborns has died. The male calf was seen alive on Jan. 3, but was found dead on Jan. 7 near Morehead City, North Carolina, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The calf, about two weeks old, appeared underweight and in poor health. It is not known what happened to his mother, but scientists said calves cannot survive very long separated from their mothers.\n\nThe calf is the 93rd whale to be added to the ongoing database of Unusual Mortality Events that the species has suffered since 2017.\n\nAccording to the New England Aquarium, there are about the same number of new calves now as there were at this time last year. But scientists say those numbers are not enough to sustain the species. By comparison, an average of 23 calves were born annually in the 2000s. That number has not been seen since 2009.\n\n“We are hoping for many more calves throughout the remainder of the calving season, and that these newborns can make it safely to their feeding grounds up north,” Hamilton said. “Amid ongoing threats from fishing gear entanglement and vessel strikes, right whales are still doing their part by calving year after year, even later in life as in the case of Spindle.”\n\nThe right whale Spindle has become a grandmother since first observed in 1982\n\nFirst observed in 1982, Spindle had her last calf in 2019 — the now entangled juvenile — before giving birth to a new baby this season. Prior to that, she birthed eight calves including Vega (Catalog #2904 ) and Champagne (Catalog #3904 ). Champagne made Spindle a grandmother in 2021.\n\nSpindle has had one minor documented entanglement in her life, but her family members have had 12 known entanglements, according to the New England Aquarium. Champagne has experienced at least four entanglements, the last of which left significant scars.\n\nAquarium research shows that more than 86 percent of right whales have been entangled at least once, some as many as nine times. One whale who has captured attention with her chronic entanglements is Snow Cone. The approximately 17-year-old whale was seen in September south of Nantucket, on her way south, struggling with her fifth entanglement.\n\nScientists, who noted the severe deterioration of her health, feared she was dying. Hurricane Fiona made it unsafe for a team from the Center for Coastal Studies to go to Snow Cone's assistance. She has not been seen since.\n\nMassachusetts works to promote preservation of North Atlantic Right Whales\n\nWith an eye toward continuing to raise awareness about the plight of the North Atlantic right whale and promote their preservation, the state Legislature earlier this month declared April 24 as Right Whale Day in Massachusetts.\n\nState Rep. Josh Cutler, D-Duxbury, was the lead sponsor of the bill, Bill H.3869, that establishes the annual event.\n\n\"Our official state marine mammal, the North Atlantic right whale, is at risk of extinction. Building awareness of their plight will help promote protection efforts and establishing this annual Right Whale Day is an important step in this process,\" he said.\n\nGain access to premium Cape Cod Times content bysubscribing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/04/21/michigan-invasive-species-asian-carp-sea-lamprey-zebra-quagga-mussels/7227536002/", "title": "Michigan's 10 most alarming invasive species: How they got here ...", "text": "They've changed life in Michigan almost everywhere you look — irrevocably in some cases.\n\nInvasive species cost tens of millions of dollars per year in control efforts in Michigan, and untold millions more in impacts on property values, lost recreational opportunities and damage to roads, ditches, pipes and other infrastructure.

Floods and landslides reshaped swaths of habitat, and more could be severely damaged by sediment loads.\n\n\"We definitely anticipate that the biggest, longest-term effects of the hurricane are going to mostly impact aquatic species and aquatic habitats,\" Owens said.\n\n\"A huge amount of human-made debris has been washed into riparian areas, which will likely cause water quality issues for many months\" in the region, Miranda Turner, a wildlife health biologist with the Wildlife Resources Commission, said in a statement.\n\n\"The severity of the water quality issues will depend on what type of debris and toxicants were released during the storm and how much of them ended up in important wildlife habitats, but the potential impact to fish, amphibians, and reptiles may be extensive.\"\n\nBiologists are just beginning to assess the scale of the harm.\n\n\"It's going to take a long time, months, if not years, to really understand what the impacts have been for the wide variety of aquatic species that we do track,\" Owens said.\n\nThe destruction has already befallen the eastern hellbender, for example − a rare salamander, and the largest amphibian in North America − whose habitat was devastated by Helene, The Citizen Times reported.\n\nAnd in McDowell County, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission reported \"significant damage\" to a state fish hatchery.\n\nAll 600,000 fish at the hatchery either died or were driven from the hatchery amid the storm, according to spokesperson Anna Gurney.\n\nThe facility is closed indefinitely while the commission assesses the damage.\n\nHow did Helene affect non-aquatic species?\n\nDeer, raccoons, coyotes and other terrestrial species are more mobile than aquatic species and are typically better equipped to dodge storm damage, Owens said.\n\n\"I'm sure there's a certain amount of any of those species that did not survive, that got swept into the flooding and drowned,\" she said, but “we don’t anticipate big population-level effects on those species.\"\n\nHelene also had tremendous influence on various bird species, some of which were in a migratory season.\n\nSome coastal bird species were swept as far inland as Indiana by the storm, according to BirdCast, a project of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and other collaborators.\n\nIn late September, as Helene drilled into western North Carolina, laughing gulls were reported near Asheville, according to displaced species data from BirdCast.\n\n\"Reports from birders across the country allowed them to see that we had some pelagic birds, which usually are only found on the ocean,\" Owens said, \"basically caught up in the winds from the storm and swept inland.\"\n\nWestern North Carolina is also \"known to have many species of bats that roost in bridges, including federally endangered gray bats,\" Turner said.\n\n\"With the loss of multiple bridges due to flooding, it is unknown whether these roosts and bats survived the storm, and it will take many months for the infrastructure in the area to improve enough that biologists will be able to access these areas to check on the bat populations.\"\n\nThe fate of many other at-risk species − including the southern bog turtle, Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander and the Carolina northern flying squirrel − remains unclear as experts struggle to reach damaged areas, Turner said.\n\nAnd amid North Carolina's changing climate, more damage is on the horizon.\n\n\"As climate change worsens and we see more frequent and severe extreme weather events,\" Turner said, \"we will likely see many more wildlife issues arise caused by the easier spread of disease, animals being forced out of their natural habitats, and increasing human-wildlife interactions as animals try to adapt to changes to their environment after these events.\"\n\nHow did Helene affect vegetation, crops and forest?\n\nHelene's destruction left a blank slate in parts of Western North Carolina, clearing trees and vegetation. Those open wounds could offer opportunities for invasive species to gain a foothold.\n\n\"The ecosystems will reestablish themselves, and we're going to be worried about invasive species that tend to take advantage of disruptions in these systems,\" Owens said. \"That might be a battle that we have to fight, more so than we would have otherwise.\"\n\nThe state will work to recover biodiversity, she said, helping native plants return and combating the spread of invasive species.\n\nInvasive plants tend to push out advantageous native species and cause other ripple effects. For example, tree of heaven, a prevalent invasive in North Carolina, is a preferred host of the spotted lanternfly − a destructive, invasive pest already establishing itself in the state.\n\nThe region's crop production also is expected to suffer. Thousands of farms and more than $600 million in crop production value sat in Helene’s path through North Carolina, according to an analysis from the American Farm Bureau.\n\n\"Excessive rainfall and flooding have created perfect conditions for bacterial and fungal diseases to thrive\" in vegetable crops, the analysis said, and food crops exposed to floodwaters cannot be sold under federal regulation.\n\nAnd landslides could compound damage in the woods blanketing the Southern Appalachian mountains. The events can \"wipe out large tracts of forest, destroy wildlife habitat, and remove productive soils from slopes,\" research has found.\n\nPisgah and Nantahala national forests withstood Helene's wrath for the most part and have reopened gradually as crews work to clear debris and repair roads and trails, The Citizen Times reported.\n\n'Decades' until ecological recovery from Helene\n\nAs experts assess the damage, both to human lives and the wildlife of western North Carolina, certain parts are expected to recover faster than others.\n\n\"Some species will return quickly,\" Owens said. \"Some types of plants, some of our aquatic species, they will return quickly.\"\n\nBut having just one species of plant or animal dominate an ecosystem is a recipe for degradation.\n\nNorth Carolina's scientists will have to fight to preserve and nurture the return of biodiversity in damaged areas.\n\nHealing will take a long time.\n\n\"In the long run, much of these areas will recover,\" Owens said. \"But when I say the long run, I mean potentially decades.\"\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)\n\nConnor Giffin is an environmental journalist with the USA TODAY Network, reporting for The Citizen Times in the wake of Helene.

See rates by county", "text": "New York's Lyme disease infection rate exploded in recent years, and was one of the highest in the country in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAlmost 16,800 cases were reported in New York in 2022, up from just over 3,000 in 2021, and the New York region's 2024 tick season was off to a record-setting start in March following the mild winter. Emergency room visits for tick bites leveled off a bit in April before illnesses bounced back in May.\n\nLyme disease is the most common disease transmitted through tick bites, the CDC said, and the number of people who have contracted the illness could be as much as 10 times higher than the reported cases.\n\nAnd with climate change raising temperatures, tick populations have expanded into new regions and put more people in contact with ticks and their illness-causing bacteria, USA TODAY reported this week. Annual cases are expected to continue to climb.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nWhere are the most cases of Lyme disease in NY?\n\nThere are three types of ticks most commonly found in New York — deer (black-legged) ticks, American dog ticks and lone star ticks — but deer ticks are the only ones that can carry the Lyme-causing bacteria, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nSuffolk and Dutchess Counties had the highest number of reported Lyme disease cases in 2022 with 2,667 and 1,175, respectively.\n\nWestchester County wasn't too far behind with 974 cases. Many counties in upstate New York saw much lower numbers. For example, Monroe County only saw 306 in 2022.\n\nU.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced last week a push for almost $200 million in the fiscal year 2025 government spending bill for research to understand the full impact of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses.\n\nHere are the number of reported cases in each New York county in 2022, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat are Lyme disease symptoms?\n\nFor most people, their first symptom is a rash, or erythema migrans, with these possible qualities, according to the state Department of Health:\n\nOccurs at or near the site of the tick bite\n\nIs a \"bulls-eye\" circular patch or solid red patch that grows larger\n\nAppears between three days and one month after the tick bite\n\nHas a diameter of 2-6 inches\n\nLasts for around 3-5 weeks\n\nMay be warm to the touch\n\nUsually not painful or itchy\n\nSometimes leads to multiple rashes\n\nJoint pain, chills, fever and fatigue are also possible symptoms and as the disease progresses, you may experience severe fatigue, stiff neck, tingling or numbness in your arms and legs or facial paralysis.\n\nThe most severe symptoms — severe headaches, painful arthritis, swelling of joints and heart and central nervous system problems — may not appear until weeks, months or even years after the bite.\n\nTick season off to record start in NY: Why is it so bad?\n\nWhen should I seek medical attention for a tick bite?\n\nYou should see your health care provider immediately, the state Department of Health says.\n\nEarly treatment against the disease consists of antibiotics and typically leads to being fully cured. However, the longer you wait to seek treatment, the greater chance you'll have at experiencing longer term symptoms.\n\nHow do I protect against tick bites?\n\nPreventing Lyme disease starts with avoiding tick bites altogether. Here's how you can protect against tick bites, according to the state Department of Health:\n\nWear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to spot ticks early.\n\nWear enclosed shoes, long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots and your shirt into your pants.\n\nCheck your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks while you're outdoors\n\nConsider using insect repellent\n\nStay on cleared, well-traveled trails, walk in the center of trails and avoid dense woods and bushy areas.\n\nAvoid sitting directly on the ground or on stone walls.\n\nIf you have long hair, tie it back, especially when gardening.\n\nBathe or shower preferably within two hours after being outside to wash off and more easily find ticks.\n\nDo a final, full-body tick check at the end of the day and promptly remove any ticks you may find.\n\nTick season in NY: Is it getting worse?\n\nHow to properly remove a tick\n\nIf you find a tick somewhere on your body, follow these steps from the state Department of Health to ensure you've removed the entire tick.\n\nUse a pair of pointed tweezers to grasp the tick by the head or mouth parts right where they enter the skin. Do not grab the tick by the body.\n\nPull firmly and steadily outward. Do not jerk or twist the tick.\n\nPlace the tick in a small container of rubbing alcohol to kill it.\n\nClean the bite wound with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide.\n\nMonitor the site of the bite for the next 30 days to make sure a rash doesn't appear.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Sara Chernikoff and Janet Loehrke and New York State Team health reporter David Robinson contributed to this report.\n\nEmily Barnes is the New York State Team consumer advocate reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Wildlife technicians could not pinpoint a cause for the dead fish because they had decomposed too much.\n\n\"A lot of times we hear about things second hand,\" said Elyse Walter, a communications specialist for the DNR. \"... Obviously, in the age of social media that stuff travels near and far, and then we are brought in for confirmation.\"\n\nShe said the DNR had a generic email people could use to report fish kills and other issues.\n\n“In the past, the public has notified DNR staff by phone or email about a fish kill,” said Gary Whelan, DNR fisheries research manager, in the news release. “While this input is hugely valuable and desired, it was not the most efficient way for us to get reports about fish kills and often delayed response. We have designed a simpler way for the public to get involved as our eyes and ears using the DNR’s Eyes in the Field.”\n\nDead fish on Harsens Island might result from winter kill\n\nDead fish spark memories of 2009 Black River fish kill\n\nInformation requested on the form includes waterbody and location including latitude-longitude coordinates; observation details; and any available photos showing the fish kill. Close-up photos showing any external disease signs such as bloody patches, unusual wounds or odd coloration are helpful to DNR staff as they try to determine the cause of the issue and its seriousness. Entered reports and associated images automatically are forwarded to fish health staff for quicker evaluation and action.\n\n\"The idea is the more information we have and the quicker it becomes available us, the better we can take action after the fact,\" Walter said.\n\nAccording to the news release, as the ice and snow melts it is not uncommon to find dead fish and other aquatic creatures. Severe weather can create conditions that kill fish, turtles, frogs, toads and crayfish.\n\n\"Winter kill is the most common type of fish kill,\" Whelan said. \"Given the harsh conditions of winter with thick ice and deep snow cover, fish kills may be particularly common in shallow lakes and streams and ponds. These kills are localized and typically do not affect the overall health of the fish populations or fishing quality.\"\n\nShallow lakes with excess aquatic vegetation and mucky bottoms are particularly prone to winter kill. Fish and other aquatic life typically die in late winter, but might not be noticed until a month after the ice leaves the lake because the dead fish and other aquatic life temporarily are preserved by the cold water.\n\n\"Winter kill begins with distressed fish gasping for air at holes in the ice and often ends with large numbers of dead fish that bloat as the water warms in early spring,\" Whelan said. \"Dead fish and other aquatic life may appear fuzzy because of secondary infection by fungus, but the fungus was not the cause of death. The fish actually suffocated from a lack of dissolved oxygen from decaying plants and other dead aquatic animals under the ice.\"\n\nDissolved oxygen is required by fish and all other forms of aquatic life. Once the daylight is greatly reduced by thick ice and deep snow cover, aquatic plants stop producing oxygen and many die. The bacteria that decompose organic materials on the bottom of the lake use the remaining oxygen in the water. Once the oxygen is reduced other aquatic animals die and start decomposing, the rate that oxygen is used for decomposition is additionally increased and dissolved oxygen levels in the water decrease even more, leading to winter kill.\n\nLast spring, dead fish began showing up along the Lake St. Clair shoreline. The cause was first thought to be winter kill. After further investigation, however, wildlife technicians determined a disease, viral hemorrhagic septicemia, had killed the fish, which were mostly gizzard shad.\n\nWalter said the earlier wildlife technicians can investigate, the better the DNR can educate people about what diseases such as VHS are and how they can affect fisheries.\n\n\"That sets us on a path of action so hopefully we can stop the spread and we can inform the public about that the cause was,\" she said.\n\n\"The more we can make them aware of what exactly the issue is and how they can address it, the better we feel it is.\"\n\nContact Bob Gross at (810) 989-6263 or rgross@gannett.com.

They automatically get better.\"\n\nFauci also in the FT interview said Trump was incorrect in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases were \"harmless\" and may have conflated some statistics.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nWHO team heads to China for investigation into origin of virus\n\nTwo scientists from the World Health Organization are traveling to Beijing on Friday to lay the groundwork for an investigation into the origins of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe researchers, an animal health expert and an epidemiologist, will work with counterparts in China to \"look at whether or not it jumped from species to human and what species it jumped from,\" WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said.\n\nThe team will determine the logistics, locations and participants for a WHO-led international mission.\n\nThe virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Scientists believe the novel virus originated in bats, transferred to another mammal then jumped to humans.\n\nThe Trump administration this week officially began withdrawing the United States from the WHO, of which President Donald Trump and his advisers have been sharply critical.\n\nSurvey: More than 1 in 3 Americans say they know someone with COVID-19\n\nAmericans are three times as likely to know someone in their community who has been sick with the coronavirus than they did in March, according to a new survey.\n\nMore than one-third of Americans (36%) say someone they know outside of their immediate family or work has been sick with the coronavirus, according to a new survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project. That number is more than triple the number in mid-March, when it was 11%.\n\nThe survey also showed Black (11%) and Latino (11%) Americans are more likely than white Americans (7%) to have had an immediate family member get sick, according to the survey. These racial differences were not apparent in the survey from March.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\n'The curve is no longer flat': Nearly half of Florida's ICUs are at least 90% full\n\nNearly half of Florida's intensive-care units are at least 90% full, and more than 1 in 5 are completely full, according to state data.\n\nHospitals are increasingly strained under COVID-19, and hospitalizations across the state have jumped more than 13% just since July 1. More than 17,100 Floridians have been hospitalized for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.\n\nA total of 95 hospital ICUs were at least 90% full Thursday, according to the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. That's nearly half the 207 ICUs that the agency is tracking. At least 45 hospital ICUs were at capacity, and 46 others had only one bed available in the units.\n\nAt least 4,111 people in Florida have died from the virus, according to the state — a figure that would have made it the ninth leading cause of death in Florida last year, according to Florida Department of Health statistics. Florida set a one-day record Thursday with 120 deaths. The previous high, 83, was in late April.\n\n– Frank Gluck, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nMississippi hospitals turning patients away\n\nThe five largest medical centers in Mississippi have no ICU bed space for new patients – coronavirus or otherwise – and are being forced to turn patients away, even as COVID-19 continue to surge.\n\nIn some cases, patients are being sent to facilities out of state and as far away as New Orleans. In many hospitals, patients admitted to the ER are being forced to spend the night before they receive treatment.\n\n\"(Wednesday), five of our biggest hospitals in the state had zero ICU beds. Zero,\" State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. \"Our biggest medical institutions who take care of our sickest patients have no room.\"\n\nThe transition from shelter-in-place to where we currently stand, with the highest number of hospitalizations since the first reported case of the coronavirus virus on March 11, has left the state \"wide open,\" said Dr. Louann Woodward, UMMC vice chancellor for health affairs.\n\n– Justin Vicory, Mississippi Clarion Ledger\n\nCalifornia to sue Trump administration over international student visa policy\n\nCalifornia is set to become the first state to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new policy that prevents international students from staying in the U.S. if their college or university switches to online-only classes in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after some colleges and universities filed similar lawsuits or announced plans to do so.\n\nThe Trump administration revealed its new guidelines in a memo issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday. It says that international students will have to leave the country, or face possible deportation, if their schools switch to remote learning, which many have planned to do amid the pandemic.\n\nTrump and CDC battle over how to reopen schools safely\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s attack on his own health experts’ guidance for safely reopening schools cracked open for public display a power struggle within the administration that has been building for months.\n\nTrump blasted the guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday as “very tough & expensive” and “asking schools to do very impractical things.”\n\nBut CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said on Thursday the guidance would stand, and his staff would provide some new documents to clarify the recommendations.\n\nThe flare-up punctuates a conflict escalating for months, with the nation’s top scientists publicly sidelined in the Trump administration’s initial coronavirus response. Earlier disagreements delayed the release of the reopening guidance for schools and businesses.\n\nPublic health leaders who worked at the CDC under prior presidents said they had never seen anything like this week’s open discord. \"It undermines leadership for everyone involved,” said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, a former CDC director. \"It's public health malpractice to say, 'Open without worrying about anything.'\"\n\n– Brett Murphy and Letitia Stein\n\nWhat's actually in the CDC school guidelines? These are the highlights.\n\nStarbucks to require customers to wear face masks starting July 15\n\nStarbucks will now require customers and employees to wear face masks when they enter stores. The policy applies to all company-owned café locations in the U.S., according to a statement by Starbucks.\n\nAt select locations where a local government mandate is not in place, customers who may not be wearing a facial covering will have various options to order their Starbucks, including ordering at the drive-thru, curbside pickup through the Starbucks app or placing an order for delivery through Starbucks Delivers.\n\nMore on the coronavirus from USA TODAY\n\nWhere a face mask is required: Many governors are instituting or renewing orders requiring people to wear face coverings in public as cases continue to rise.

Neanderthals weren’t brutish cave dwellers — they made sophisticated tools, yarn and art, and they buried their dead with care.\n\nA new discovery in a Siberian cave this week reveals an intimate portrait of Neanderthal family life and shows it may be time for Homo sapiens to ditch that superiority complex once and for all.\n\nWe are family\n\nAn artist's reconstruction depicts a Neanderthal father and his daughter. Tom Bjorklund\n\nScientists have uncovered the oldest known family group, using ancient DNA from Neanderthals who lived in Chagyrskaya Cave in southern Siberia in Russia.\n\nThe riverside hunting camp about 54,000 years ago was home to a tight community of about 20 Neanderthals, including a father and his teenage daughter, a young male who might have been a nephew or a cousin, and an adult female who was a second-degree relative — perhaps an aunt or a grandmother.\n\nThe researchers also detected an unexpected pattern of female migration among the different threads of genetic ancestry.\n\nThe most likely explanation for this was that most of the female Neanderthals in the small Chagyrskaya group had come from another community — perhaps to join their mate’s family.\n\nA long time ago\n\nIf you lived in London during the Black Death, the odds of beating the bubonic plague weren’t good — it killed 50% of Europe’s population over the course of seven years.\n\nThe lucky survivors of the Black Death that ravaged Europe had — in part — their genes to thank, new research has found. Using DNA extracted from teeth, scientists were able to identify a key genetic difference that influenced who survived and who died from the disease.\n\nThat genetic legacy still affects the human immune system today, according to the researchers, but in a less desirable way when it comes to certain autoimmune diseases.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe V-1302 John Mahn, a German ship sunk by the British in World War II, continues to leak toxic elements onto the seafloor.

However, whether the impact happened before or after the creature’s death is unknown.\n\nThe discovery was a “sign that the oceans are still healthy enough to sustain the heaviest species existing,” said José Nuno Gomes-Pereira, a postdoctoral researcher from the Atlantic Naturalist Association, “but a warning for more conservation in terms of pollution and boat traffic near oceanic islands.”\n\nExplorations\n\nKick back with these remarkable reads:\n\n— Elephants’ incredible memory is helping them survive in the harsh environment of the Namibian desert.\n\n— It’s a myth spread by dog owners that cats are cold and aloof.

Wade put her life in danger.\n\nCNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.\n\nNow, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nThe loss of a ‘miracle’ baby\n\nAmanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.\n\n“Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.\n\nThree years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.\n\nThey tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.\n\nBut Josh does.\n\n“It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”\n\nFamily members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.\n\nDoctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.\n\n‘These barbaric laws’\n\nBut her medical ordeal isn’t over.\n\nAmanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.\n\nThat leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.\n\n“[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”\n\nThe Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way.\n\n“Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.\n\n“Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.\n\nIn many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“All of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,” she said.\n\nShe and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas. What would happen to them, considering what happened to Amanda?\n\n“These barbaric laws prevented her from getting any amount of health care when she needed it, until it was at a life-threatening moment,” Josh said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen John Bonifield", "Elizabeth Cohen", "John Bonifield"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2018/09/20/salem-keizer-further-behind-oregon-state-standardized-testing-results/1350484002/", "title": "Data shows Salem-Keizer is further behind in state testing results", "text": "Around 90 percent of Oregon's students are taking state standardized assessments, depending on the district, grade and test.\n\nBut while most students are taking the tests, nearly half perform poorly, according to statewide assessment data released Thursday by the Oregon Department of Education.\n\nAnd Salem-Keizer Public School students are, in many cases, further behind state averages.\n\nEvery year, students in grades three through eight and 11 are expected to take standardized assessments.\n\nData from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, or SBAC, and the Oregon Assessment of Knowledge and Skill, known as OAKS, show how students fare in English language arts, math and science.\n\nAcross Oregon, the 2017-18 data showed students made progress in English language arts, while math and science results remained stagnant or declined.\n\nMORE:New report says Oregon teachers aren't paid enough\n\nWhile federal law requires 95 percent of all students participate, Oregon has an opt-out option for families who do not want their kids to take the English and math tests.\n\nThose who oppose the tests argue the preparation work takes too much time, money and energy for little gain. They also say the tests don't adequately represent students' abilities.\n\nBut others say the tests are one of the only ways to know if schools are teaching students the necessary information in core subjects.\n\nOfficials from the Oregon Department of Education said the data help keep schools and districts accountable, target help for schools who need it the most and give the state an idea of which students are on track to graduate ready for life after high school.\n\nHigh participation, low results\n\nMost students in Oregon participate in the annual assessments, with about 93 percent of students across the state participating in last year's English language arts and math tests, and about 89 percent of students taking the science test.\n\nStudents with disabilities and students identifying as Black/African American participated at the lowest rates, data show.\n\nBut when looking at the number of students who received a Level 3 or 4 score — meaning they met or exceeded state standards — only about half of Oregon students did.\n\nStudents who receive a Level 3 or 4 are considered on track to graduate high school ready for college and the workplace, department officials said.\n\nStatewide, about 55 percent of students earned a Level 3 or 4 distinction last year in English language arts, 40.5 percent earned the distinction for math and about 60 percent earned the distinction for science.\n\nThese numbers are slightly up from the year prior for English, steady for math and slightly down for science.\n\n\"One area that we know we need to do a better job ... is increasing the cognitive complexity of classroom assignments,\" said Colt Gill, director of the Oregon Department of Education.\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nIn addition to making sure assignments meet the need for critical thinkers, Gill said, the department is also focusing on supporting students from historically-underserved backgrounds.\n\nThe goal is to leverage state and federal money to address chronic absenteeism, trauma-informed practices and other initiatives, he said, also saying it costs the state about $1.8 million per year for the English language arts and mathematics assessments.\n\nThe state goal, as outlined in Senate Bill 253, is for 40 percent of Oregon students to earn a higher education degree — a Bachelor's or higher — and 40 percent earn an associate’s degree or certificate in a skilled occupation. They want the remainder to at least attain a high school diploma or its equivalent, Gill said.\n\nMORE: Gov. Kate Brown, Rep. Knute Buehler split on education strategies\n\n\"We do not want any of Oregon’s students to graduate from high school without the skills and knowledge they need to pursue their postsecondary goals,\" Gill said.\n\nAdditionally, high school students can use the English language arts and math scores from the state assessments as part of their high school graduation requirements, Gill said. Students can also use a state-approved standardized test, such as the ACT or SAT, or a work sample that is scored by trained staff.\n\nSalem-Keizer outcomes\n\nIn Salem-Keizer, the percentage of students meeting or exceeding the state standard is lower than the state averages for each subject.\n\nAccording to the 2017-18 data released Thursday, only 48.6 percent of Salem-Keizer students earned a Level 3 or 4 for English language arts. That's about 6 percentage points lower than the state and down from 49.4 percent the year before.\n\nOnly 34 percent earned the distinction in math, which is 6.5 percentage points lower than the state and down from about 36 percent the year before.\n\nAnd 51.7 percent of students earned a Level 3 or 4 for science, down from 54.5 percent the year prior and 8.5 percentage points lower than the state.\n\n\"We focus on helping our students grow,\" Linda Myers, director of strategic initiatives for Salem-Keizer, said in a statement. \"We know how they perform on one test, one year doesn’t define our children.\"\n\nBut not only is Salem-Keizer performing lower than the state as a whole, they are also performing worse compared to themselves in recent years.\n\nThe district's assessment numbers in all three subjects are down by 2 to almost 8 percentage points since 2014-15.\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nSalem-Keizer did see improvements this year in the five schools where the district's new Ready Math curriculum was piloted — Highland, Keizer, Scott, Morningside and Salem Heights elementary schools.\n\nAnd in a press release, district officials said though Salem-Keizer students perform lower than their peers across the state in science, \"curriculum access will be expanded with the addition of state-of-the-art science spaces at middle and high schools thanks to the 2018 bond measure.\"\n\nLooking at other districts, outcomes seem to be hurting across the board.\n\nFor example, while Portland Public Schools — the largest school district in the state — saw minor gains in English language arts, their math and science averages declined.\n\nDallas School District — a smaller, more rural district by comparison — saw percentages decrease in all three subject averages, but they were at least within 4 percentage points of the state's numbers.\n\nAnd Woodburn School district — which has seen dramatic graduate rate increases in recent years — still saw decreasing rates for math and science, while less than a third of students earned a Level 3 or 4 for English language arts.\n\n\"Our students are more than just numbers on an assessment,\" Christy Perry, superintendent for Salem-Keizer, said in a statement. \"They are young people who ... bring a multitude of experiences — some wonderful and some incredibly difficult — with them when they come to school.\n\n\"We remain committed to each and every child so they can graduate prepared for successful lives,\" she said.\n\nFor more information on state assessment results, or to look up your individual district or school, go to https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment or call 503-947-5600.\n\nContact reporter Natalie Pate at npate@StatesmanJournal.com, 503-399-6745 or follow her on Twitter @Nataliempate or Facebook at www.Facebook.com/nataliepatejournalist.\n\nSupport our journalism: Become a Statesman Journal subscriber today and get unlimited digital access to support local stories that matter.\n\nMORE: Attorney general says mandatory reporters don't need to report consensual teen sex", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/backbeat/2015/11/09/ok-grudgingly-admit-enjoyed-archuleta-concert/75456092/", "title": "OK, I grudgingly admit I enjoyed that Archuleta concert", "text": "Brian Passey\n\nbpassey@thespectrum.com\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Piano Guys’ concert at Tuacahn Amphitheatre in Ivins. Now that surprise has been awarded to David Archuleta.\n\nI’ve never considered myself a fan of either. I’m still not sure I do. But both The Piano Guys and David Archuleta know how to entertain and that’s what they did.\n\nI’ll admit, prior to Friday night’s sold-out show (he also sold out a Saturday show), my knowledge of Archuleta’s music was confined to a single album — his 2012 covers record, “Begin.” I reviewed that album when it came out and the gist of it was: beautiful voice, not much emotion. That’s what I expected from his live show but he proved me wrong.\n\nAs he came out on stage, I wasn’t even sure if we were going to get his famously beautiful voice. He sounded a bit hoarse on “The Other Side Of Down,” his opening song. But it seems as if his voice just needed to warm up. By the time he lit into his cover of Keane’s “Somewhere Only We Know” he was sounding great and working the stage like a pro. And by his third song, “Don’t Run Away,” he was even bringing some powerful emotion to his delivery.\n\nStill, I wanted to remain a curmudgeon. I had this idea in my head that Archuleta was overrated. But I found myself grudgingly applauding. He had earned it after all.\n\nNeed a break?

The ape man, however, was a no-show.\n\nArchuleta’s appeal to the teenage girls was apparent through the evening. Many screamed compliments or requests to him between songs. While some screamed, “I love you!” at least one fan annoying demanded, “Follow me on Instagram!” multiple times through the evening.\n\nWhile the singer seemed at home on the stage while performing, the dialogue between songs was at times awkward. It occasionally took him a few minutes to get to the point of what he was trying to say. He rambled a bit. Yet somehow it was endearing. He seemed genuine and unfettered by the fame he found early in life.\n\nIn addition to talking about his career in the music industry since he became the runner-up on “American Idol” in 2008, Archuleta also spoke at length about his two-year religious mission to Chile for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 2012 to 2014.\n\n“I’m so glad I went,” he said of the mission, despite many questioning whether it was right to leave behind a promising music career for two years. “It really has changed my life.”\n\nHe also spoke at length on the subject of beauty and what it means to be beautiful. This discussion somehow involved a tangent about his sisters’ cats, which was strange but comical. Eventually he got to his point that, for him, beauty is someone who radiates light when they come to realize who they are as children of God. It was all a lead in for his cover of Christina Aguilera’s “Beautiful.”\n\nA few minutes later, yet another girl screamed, “I love you!” and he became flustered on stage: “You know, I never know what to say … when someone says, ‘I love you.’ … I don’t know who you are.” Poor kid. But it was refreshing to see it hasn’t all gone to his head.\n\nPlus it provided a good lead-in to how the music industry people kept trying to get him to record a love song but their idea of a love song wasn’t the same as his. So he decided to write one of his own. Then he sat down at the grand piano on stage and performed “My Kind Of Perfect” solo on the piano. I didn’t even realize he played. The curmudgeonly critic had to award yet another point to the boy with the golden voice.\n\nAfter the pretty piano song, he began to talk to the crowd once more but became distracted by the lights on the Tuacahn backstage — the amphitheater’s red rock cliffs. “Talk about beautiful,” he said, to which a girl in the crowd loudly responded: “You’re more beautiful!” Cue flustered Archuleta again.\n\nWhile Archuleta’s vocals remained impressive throughout the show, some of the covers did not quite stand up to their original versions. For example, his voice soared over his take on U2’s “Pride (In The Name Of Love),” but he needs a little more Bono-like grit in his voice to truly capture the powerful emotions of the song.\n\nBut one cover more than made up for any shortcomings on the others. Like the others, it too came from his “Begin” album and this time his opening act, a 17-year-old Kansas City singer-songwriter named Gracie Schram joined him on stage for Peter Gabriel’s “Don’t Give Up.” Schram lent her angelic vocals to the gorgeous hook, performed on the original by Kate Bush and on Archuleta’s recording by Libbie Linton of the Provo band Mideau. Schram’s voice melodiously wafted over the notes while even Archuleta’s vocals seemed fuller, rising to her challenge and soaring near the end.\n\nPerhaps most impressive was how vulnerable Archuleta allowed himself to be with the audience. He spoke of his doubts about returning to the music industry after serving in Chile. Then he sang about it in a new song, “Numb,” which had some cliches but a powerful chorus.\n\nHe ended his set with “Crush,” much to the delight of his screaming fans, as he stalked the stage in his own distinctive way — a mixture of dynamic and restrained.\n\nOf course, there was an encore. The first number was an all-acoustic Spanish song. Although I didn’t understand what he was saying, it was one of his best performances of the evening and he seemed to deliver it with the most passion. Then he finished off the night with “Glorious,” a song from the documentary “Meet the Mormons” and an apparent favorite of the audience.\n\nWhile Archuleta was obviously the main act, the audience seemed to quite enjoy Schram’s opening performance. While she lacked Archuleta’s comfort at working the stage while she performed, she seemed more adept at stage banter, telling delightful stories as she introduced herself to the audience.\n\nA few of her songs seemed like your standard indie-pop ditties. It wasn’t surprising to hear that Colbie Caillat collaborator Jason Reeves has also written with Schram. But on quite a few of the songs, Schram’s own unique voice came out.\n\nAfter her opening number, Schram spoke of having a super power connected to the yellow shoes she was wearing. She said people often compliment her on the shoes then leave feeling happier. “It has the power to turn their day around,” she said.\n\nThen, as she began the song “Yellow Shoes,” her voice emerged. She has a bit of that indie-pop voice employed by the likes of Regina Spektor, Lorde or even Mindy Gledhill and Libbie Linton right here in Utah. From there her voice just improved, developing an Ani Difranco-like quality to it by the time she performed the absolutely gorgeous “Different.”\n\nSchram later revealed she has been singing since she was 7. When she was only 10 she learned about the plight of orphans in Africa so she decided to sell CDs to raise money for them, eventually raising $40,000 for different humanitarian projects around the world. She used this story to encourage the audience to sing along with her final song and its chorus, “We don’t have to wait / We are the change.”\n\nAt the end of her set, I thought she was going to be the highlight for the night and upstage Archuleta. I’m reluctantly glad to say he proved me wrong. Both were delightful in their own unique ways. And most importantly, both proved to be impressive young people who have managed to maintain a sense of humility alongside their copious talents.\n\nEmail Brian at brian@thespectrum.com and follow him at Facebook.com/PasseyBrian or on Twitter and Instagram, @BrianPassey.

Over half of these respondents (57%) are forking out up to £249. \"With the cost-of-living crisis already causing financial issues for many families, it's understandable why British parents are feeling the pressure of having to pay alarming amounts for school kit,\" said a blog on the shoe retailer's site.\n\nParents are \"routinely paying more than double the price for branded school uniforms, compared with similar items offered by supermarkets and high-street stores\", found analysis by The Observer.\n\nIn a bid to alleviate some of this financial burden, the new Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will impose a limit of three branded items of school uniform required by primary schools, and four items by secondary schools, if a tie is branded. Set to come into effect in September 2026, \"this includes PE kit and applies to after-school activities\" but still allows schools to offer \"optional\" branded uniform items, said Schools Week.\n\nPro: promotes discipline and focus\n\nUniforms became more common in the US in the late 1980s \"with the promise that they would curb gang violence and crime\", said The Washington Post. Uniforms, teachers say, \"have become a no-nonsense way to stave off distractions\" and focus on learning.\n\nThis argument is a variation on the \"broken windows\" theory of law and order, said Will Hazell for The i Paper: \"if schools clamp down on sloppy dress and incorrect clothing, it makes clear to pupils that the teachers are in charge\".\n\nWhile there is little empirical evidence to back this up, the rationale has nevertheless been used as part of a pilot programme in France to establish if uniforms can improve behaviour. If successful the French government has said the scheme could be rolled out nationwide.\n\nCon: curbs freedom of expression\n\nThe claim that school uniforms restrict personal expression is the \"most frequently used defence against them\", said Fashion Law Journal. \"Kids and teenagers express themselves and identify with particular social groupings through their clothing choices\" and so \"many students who oppose school uniforms claim that, when they are denied the freedom to express themselves through clothing, they lose their sense of self\".\n\nThe growing support for school uniforms in the US is \"one of the great surrenderings of liberty in modern history\", said Mark Oppenheimer in The New Yorker. Uniforms are \"yet one more way that the surveillance of the un-powerful – the poor, people of colour, and that great unheard group of the young – has become increasingly acceptable\".\n\nIn August, the UK Competition and Markets Authority urged schools to think about whether their policies on uniform are actually in the \"best interest of pupils and parents\".\n\nPro: could save time and money overall\n\nConversely, uniforms can also \"save students and parents time and money\", said the School Wear United blog.\n\n\"Instead of spending time each morning trying to decide what to wear, students can simply put on their uniforms and be ready for school. Additionally, uniforms can be less expensive than trendy clothing, and they can often be purchased in bulk or handed down from older siblings.\"\n\nPut bluntly, when there is a uniform policy, \"there is no peer pressure on students to have the latest trainers\", Dame Rachel De Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England, told The i Paper.\n\nCon: continued gender issues\n\nA 2018 survey from Plan International UK found that a third of British girls said they were sexually harassed while in their school uniforms. Of course, there is no real evidence that they would have been any safer out of school uniform.\n\nThere is also the widely held view that schools police female students' uniform to a greater extent than they do with boys, particularly with regards to modesty rules.\n\n\"If we're going to have school uniforms, it should be the same for every child with no differing options,\" said one mother in Metro. \"Then if boys and girls all wear trousers, we don't need arguments about skirt lengths or about which uniform non-binary or transgender children should wear.\"", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnists/ted-evanoff/2017/06/24/ted-evanoff-if-elvis-fading-you-wouldnt-know-numbers/413344001/", "title": "Ted Evanoff: If Elvis is fading you wouldn't know it by the numbers", "text": "Memphis tourism has ticked higher this year, a reflection of the new exhibits at Graceland, low gasoline prices and the sheer curiosity of visitors eager to touch the music and times of 20th-century America.\n\nBritish newspapers say the value of Elvis collectibles has been declining, though Australian, British and New Zealand visitors have trooped through Sun Studio and Graceland all spring, part of a general increase in Memphis tourism.\n\nGraceland completed $137 million worth of expansions in March, hotel occupancy rates are up citywide, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music opens seven days a week, and visits to the National Civil Rights Museum, a 26-year-old institution renovated in 2014, have climbed to a near double-digit increase this spring.\n\n“It’s every year, just growing and growing,” said Nina Jones, operations manager at Sun Studio, which figures to attract about 200,000 visitors this year.\n\nHotel visitors\n\nDespite the heavy storm May 27, during a big tourist weekend in the city, occupancy rates at hotels citywide averaged 65.4 percent this year through May, up 1.9 percent compared with the same months last year, reports Smith Travel Research, a national market researcher in Hendersonville, Tenn.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe uptick shows the city has performed slightly better than the nation. Occupancy rates for hotels nationwide averaged 65.4 percent through May.\n\nWhile the Memphis and U.S. rates match, Smith Travel executive Jan Freitag said the national average is flat to slightly down compared with the first five months of 2016.\n\nAlthough 1.9 percent is no big gain, the number suggests stability for Greater Memphis’ hospitality industry, which employs about 65,000 workers in bars, restaurants, nightclubs, hotels, museums, tour buses, casinos, golf courses and the like.\n\nBack to the '50s\n\nIn many ways, Memphis’ barometer of tourism success is the Beale Street Historic District. Once famous nationwide as a black business district, Beale has been recast as a 1950s neon-lit American street. The nightclubs and shops attracted 6 million visitors last year, making it Tennessee’s leading tourist destination.\n\nIf Americans ever lose their curiosity about the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, tourism in Memphis could easily fade. For now, the city rides on the tide of baby boomers intent on driving in and looking back. And their children and grandchildren are said to marvel at a time thought to be less complicated.\n\n“I saw the TV show and decided I had to see the studio,” said baby boomer Gail Brossart of California, Ky., referring to “Sun Records,” as she awaited Sun Studios’ tour.\n\nThe television show portrays a real event. Sun’s Sam Phillips recorded four talented musicians in the 1950s. The new mass market then created by TV and radio made them household names — Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley.\n\nToday, music surely brings in the visitors, Jones said, although the 1950s also intrigues millennials in their 20s and 30s. They view the musicians as ordinary people following their talent and achieving success in a quieter period.\n\n“They’re longing for the simpler time of the 1950s,” said Jones, 22, who herself plays classical violin. “It’s more than just nostalgia. It’s about wanting an authentic, genuine life experience rather than just be in this world where everything is on your phone and run by computers.”\n\nAmerica's town square\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., son of a Baptist minister, was hardly ordinary as a civil rights leader. Yet it was the strike by the city garbage collection workers in 1968 that brought him to Memphis, where he was slain at the Lorraine Motel by a sniper.\n\nToday, the National Civil Rights Museum, which includes the entire actual motel as an exhibit, commemorates MLK and the civil rights movement. Since the $28 million renovation, the museum's role has expanded to become an American town square for the ongoing discussion about freedom and justice.\n\nAudiences include tourists and regional events such as the February prayer vigil for the Refugee Empowerment Program, Comunidades Unidas en Una Voz and the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.\n\n“Our mission is to chronicle history, examine issues, provoke debate and be a catalyst for social change,’’ said museum President Terri Lee Freeman. “In many ways we’re doing what people always have done. Ordinary people took it on themselves and said 'I have role to play in making this country a better country.' ’’\n\nThe institution is on pace to attract 300,000 visitors this year, compared with 276,000 last year, with three of every four visitors coming from 120 miles away or more.\n\nAn upwelling of interest in African-American history and the ongoing focus on civil rights have helped boost attendance. Some visitors decided to experience the Memphis museum after touring the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, Freeman said.\n\n'More than music'\n\nTourists taking in the civil rights museum are inclined to visit the city's music museums. Blues, soul and gospel became mainstream American music in Memphis played by whites and blacks in an era when integration was uncommon.\n\n\"My favorite thing about Memphis music is that it's more than just about the music,'' Jones said. \"It's about civil rights and what was happening in the country at the time. I think people still really like the music because they know these were genuine people making this music.\"\n\nElvis Week\n\nFor many people in Memphis, and around the world, Elvis Presley typified the genuine nature of Memphis musicians.\n\nElvis Presley Enterprises Inc. will commemorate the 40th anniversary of the entertainer’s death, beginning Aug. 11 at Graceland, the mansion in Memphis he acquired in 1957.\n\nNo one doubts the Elvis Week crowd will exceed the 30,000 to 40,000 who typically throng the 14-acre Graceland complex on the anniversary of his death on Aug. 16, 1977.\n\nGraceland has just completed a $137 million expansion. In March, larger exhibit facilities were added to accompany the Guesthouse at Graceland, the 450-room luxury hotel finished in 2016.\n\nJust before hotel construction began, museum officials estimated the hotel and larger exhibits could attract 670,000 visitors each year, compared with 530,000 in 2014.\n\nOnce schools reopen in August, daily attendance often falls at Memphis museums, though the Elvis anniversary promises more visitors. A boost in Graceland attendance generally spills over into more visitors at Stax, Sun, the Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum, the Blues Hall of Fame and other sites.\n\n“I do think we’ll see a bump” in attendance, Stax Executive Director Jeff Kollath said.\n\nHigh wind on Memorial Day weekend put Stax among the 150,000 power customers without electricity. The museum was closed for six days and decided to recover lost revenue by opening on Mondays in June and July.\n\nKollath expects about 60,000 visitors this year at Stax, which is marking 60 years since the recording studio was opened. Special exhibits including a tribute to musician Rufus Thomas.\n\nPeak Elvis?\n\nExactly why the global image of Elvis as an American icon endures is open to debate, but every so often it’s said interest in him has begun to fade. Last month the idea resurfaced.\n\nThe Guardian, a major British newspaper, reported an auction house in the West Midlands found values of Elvis memorabilia dropping by half, and noted music catalogs showed the price plummeting on rare Elvis recordings, including \"Good Rockin’ Tonight.\"\n\n“The truth is, with many Elvis fans and collectors well into their 70s and 80s,” the Guardian opined, “… there simply aren’t enough collectors left.”\n\nFans contend interest in Elvis hasn’t worn away. Rather, they say, collectors at the leading edge of the baby boom have flooded markets with their Elvis possessions, driving down prices.\n\nWhile the Guardian may be accurate, it is not certain fewer collectors translates into fewer Memphis tourists.\n\nFew dead celebrities have been persistently publicized as long as Presley has.\n\n“Since his death the stream of printed material on the life, death and myth of Elvis Presley has been continuous,” writes George Plasketes in the 1997 book “Images of Elvis Presley in American Culture.”\n\nBecause American popular culture became a global phenomenon not long after Presley acquired Graceland, it’s probably safe to guess several billion people on earth know his name. For decades it was said Coca-Cola and Elvis were the two products known worldwide as uniquely American.\n\nDoes that mean Elvis tourists will always stream to Memphis? No.\n\nIt does suggest the icon will not, as the baby boomers pass, quickly fade from common memory the way we no longer know the name of, say, Colleen Moore, the once-famous silent film actress who ushered in the 1920s bob hairdo.\n\nTed Evanoff, business columnist of The Commercial Appeal, can be reached at evanoff@commercialappeal.com and (901) 529-2292.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2014/08/15/vestal-marching-band/14052645/", "title": "Striking up the band", "text": "Sara Tracey, and Jeff Platsky\n\nBinghamton\n\nThey've yet to take a single step or play a single note, to don the black hats or slide on the crisp, white gloves. Their first performance before a real crowd is weeks away, and the pressures of competitions to come are but a glimmer of excitement on the horizon.\n\nAll that comes later. First, there's this: Seventeen of the newest members of the Vestal Marching Band, eyes fixed on a screen in the high school auditorium, watching a study in near perfection.\n\nThe students — the youngest among them just 12 years old — are settled into twin rows of seats. The flickering film illuminates their faces in the gloom. On the screen, more than 150 members of the Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps move as one seamless black, purple and teal machine.\n\nThe performance is from this year's Drum Corps International World Championship Finals in Indianapolis. The Vestal students take in the fluidity and crispness of the formations. The color guard members spin their flags with precision. The trumpets blare in perfect counterpoint to the staccato of the drums.\n\nSome of these performers are the same age as the members of Vestal's rookie squad, who will spend the next two-plus months aspiring to such a performance. Along with their more seasoned fellow band members, they'll vie Oct. 26 for a winning place among the state's finest marching bands.\n\nTwelve minutes later, band director Greg Harris pauses the video. Four beats of silence, then five. Finally, from the audience of rookies, a single hushed word breaks the quiet.\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\nBuilding momentum\n\nThe goal of the video shown on Tuesday, the first day of rookie band camp, is to inspire, not to intimidate, Vestal's new marching band members. That's also the goal of rookie camp in general: 7.5 hours spread over three days designed to acclimate participants to the basics of the band. Next week, they'll be joined by the veterans as they start two weeks of intense band camp sessions.\n\n\"This is an unattainable goal,\" Harris tells the group after the video ends. \"We will not look like this. We will not sound like this. But this is the goal, always.\"\n\nRookie camp is the first step. It's a chance for the students, who are in seventh through 12th grades, to get to know each other as well as the team of band leaders and more seasoned students who serve as guides for other members of the band.\n\nPractical lessons abound, as well: They'll learn basic steps, how to wear and store their uniforms, how to hold their instruments and more.\n\nFor the band's director, the rookie camp is an early barometer of the path his students will take from here to the state competition.\n\nThis is the second year that Harris — an affable 29-year-old who lives in Candor with his wife and newborn son — has overseen the marching band. He's hoping a little consistency will make a big difference in the band's success; there have been four or five different directors at the band's helm in nearly as many years, he said.\n\nMore time has passed than that since the band has truly sparkled at the state competition. Each year for the past decade, the band has placed in the bottom half of its division in the New York State Field Band Conference Championship, which draws some 53 competitive marching bands from schools around the state. For the past several years, Vestal has competed in the Small Schools 3 Division, which includes a dozen bands this year.\n\nVestal was a founding member of that conference back in 1972, making it part of a local marching legacy. This year, Harris hopes, will add some much-needed shine to that legacy.\n\nThey've got the team: a strong group of adult and student leaders who handle everything from visuals and music to color guard and the various types of instruments. They've got the numbers: This year, the band nearly doubled in size, from 27 students to 49 at last count.\n\nAnd they've got the momentum: \"Last year was a transition year; this will be a lot easier to get started,\" Harris said. \"This year, I'm just excited to go. We can hit the ground running now.\"\n\nFirst steps\n\nNinety minutes after the rookies watch their video, 13-year-old Mukundan Murali, of Vestal, takes his first proper marching band step — and stumbles.\n\nHe wobbles while trying to balance on the left heel and right toe of his soccer cleats, surrounded by fellow band members all trying to master the same basic stance. He hold the pose for as long as he can, then teeters to the right. With a nervous smile, he rights himself.\n\nThe problem, he quickly realizes, are the cleats. While most of the students are clad in sneakers, Mukundan has just come from his final practice with the Greater Binghamton Footskills soccer academy. He's still wearing his uniform of knee-high, midnight blue socks and his goldenrod jersey, reflecting off the brass of the alto saxophone hanging around his neck.\n\nSoon, he'll trade the soccer clothes for the heavy, wool marching band ensemble. The cleats will be swapped for sleek, black Dinkles marching shoes that must be worn with black socks. The sax, of course, stays.\n\nOn this rainy Tuesday, the group has gathered to practice in the auditorium, though nicer weather later in the week will allow them space to stretch outdoors in the school's parking lot.\n\nThe rain reprieve will be short-lived. There's a reason Harris asked his musicians to tuck the six movements of music they'll be performing this season into plastic sheet protectors: Once the season starts, the only weather they won't perform in is thunder and lightning.\n\n\"I don't want to scare them, not yet,\" he says before the first day of rookie camp starts.\n\nThat season includes performances at some home games as well as five competitions standing between them and the state contest. Harris will use each as learning opportunities, chances to get better, to become the best.\n\nThe band will perfect a performance that has an international flair; they're calling it \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" But this is an 80-day journey for the band members as well: exactly 80 days from the band's first full music run-through, held at the beginning of August, to its state competition Oct. 26 in Syracuse University's Carrier Dome.\n\nBefore that, however, comes the very first steps — literally. These rookies must learn to march: left foot — always the left foot — in front of the right.\n\n\"You just took your first step, and that's the first step,\" Joshua Jenkins, the band's visual coordinator, tells the group. \"But we've got to work on it.\"\n\nNow, the process begins again: Jenkins commands the band to come to attention as music director Dan Miller taps out a rhythm on the blue gock — named for the sharp, echoing sound the block makes — to keep time.\n\nPrecision and uniformity are cornerstone skills for a marching band. Competition scores penalize bands when members fall out of step.\n\n\"There's no faster way to learn responsibility (than) when there's 60 other people relying on you to do something in a certain time in a certain way,\" Harris says.\n\nHe's seen the way that group reliance can forge close-knit ties. Relationships spring up. Some students start off as nervous newbies, unsure of how to navigate the high school hallways or the way to wear their uniform. As the season stretches on, after the hours of rehearsals and the bus rides and the performances, friendships will persist long after the music dies down, Harris says.\n\nFor Dan O'Brien, a 14-year-old eighth-grader and a new trombone player for the band, the Vestal Marching Band is a team no different than the high school's football squad.\n\n\"The work that we're doing ... this is a sport of its own,\" Dan says at the close of the first day of camp.\n\nPlotting the course\n\nAt the end of Tuesday's rehearsal, Harris reviews the day with fellow leaders Jenkins and Miller. They're pleased — some of the rookies looked like veterans even on their first day. Others need more time, but it's nothing that can't be worked on before band camp ends and regular after-school rehearsals begin.\n\nThere are typical complications: One rookie missed opening day, and another will be absent for the entire beginners' camp.\n\nHarris sits alone at his desk in the office next door to the band room and scans the roster for next week's full band camp, which begins Monday. He sighs when he realizes two dropouts will push the total number to just below 50.\n\nHarris turns his attention to plans for the next day's camp. By the end of the week, the rookies will need to be able to blend in with their more experienced bandmates. Mostly, that means marching: forward, backward, keeping time.\n\nOn Tuesday, they started with a single step. On Wednesday, Harris hopes, they'll begin stepping forward. Over the course of the next two months, the band will march for miles.\n\nIt's a long road to the state championships.\n\nThis year, the New York State Field Band Conference will have one of its largest pools of competitive marching bands since it began in the 1970s.\n\nThroughout the years, however, fewer and fewer Broome County bands have participated.\n\nVestal and Norwich schools were among the six charter members that started the conference in February 1972. The organization created a standardized set of competition rules and added judges to provide feedback to the different groups.\n\nParticipation from state marching bands has grown since the first championship performance in 1974 brought together 11 bands. This year, 52 bands will march in Syracuse University's Carrier Dome on Oct. 26.\n\nSeveral Broome County school marching bands have been featured in the conference's fall competitions, but some have not stayed on as participants through the years. Three area districts that once, but no longer, had competitive bands in the conference include Chenango Valley, Susquehanna Valley and Binghamton.\n\nToday, Union-Endicott, Johnson City and Vestal are still active in the conference.\n\nConference historian Jon Armstrong gave several reasons why bands could dissolve in a school district. Students now have more and more clubs and priorities vying for their attention. Different band directors could change their minds about their band marching competitively.\n\nAccording to the New York State Education Department's Office of Information and Reporting Services, participation in senior high marching bands by both students performing and teachers has dropped nearly 50 percent in about the last 40 years.\n\nIn the 1975-76 school year, the year after the first New York State Field Band Conference Competition, there were nearly 21,000 students in a senior high school marching band, with 261 teachers involved. Fast forward to the 2011-12 school year, and the number of students drops to about 11,000 with only 140 teachers.\n\nSome school marching bands still exist, but in much smaller form. For example, the Vestal Marching Band once competed in the largest classification of schools, with upwards of 170 band members, Armstrong said. This year, they have 49 — and that's nearly double from last year.\n\nDan Miller remembers playing in Union-Endicott's marching band in its heyday in the 1980s, boasting nearly 200 members. Now, as the music director for the Vestal band, he said he wants students to still feel the same excitement as he did years ago.\n\n\"We reached a low point of enrollment, but I'm proud seeing that we're growing,\" he said.\n\nThere are no school bells luring some students into the band room of Vestal High School early Monday, more than three weeks before the first day of classes.\n\nIt's the start of band camp season, with only 69 days left in the Vestal Marching Band's 80-day journey to Syracuse's Carrier Dome and the New York State Field Band Conference Championships. Even before then, they'll be performing in front of supporting fans — their parents — in about two weeks for their first full show run-through.\n\nStudents start filing in to the band room by 7:45 a.m., toting instrument cases and gurgling half-gallon water jugs. There's no need for band director Greg Harris to tell the group what to do: The schedule that will change every morning of the two-week camp is on the white board.\n\nThrough the sleepy haze that will eventually rise with the sun, there's a buzzing energy. The band is bigger, the music is exciting. It's time to go.\n\nMolly Merges walks into room 114 for her last first day of band camp. The senior has been made section leader of the guard, leading a group of six other girls spinning flags and adding a dance quality to the music-heavy group.\n\nShe's come prepared. A new color guard saber and rifle, the latter wrapped in a fresh coat of white vinyl tape. Though she hasn't spun a flag in a group since winter guard ended on March 4, she's practiced as often as she could in her Vestal front yard this summer, readying for her last camp. She bears the scars of her work, literally: A healed cut with a still-forming bruise decorates her left calf, thanks to her new saber. The summer, she says, will be full of marks like that from collisions with props.\n\n\"It already smells like sunscreen,\" she says to a fellow guard girl, gathering her equipment for section rehearsals.\n\nSunscreen, sneakers and gallons of ice water are small comforts in the intensive two-week band camp. The students, some of them as young as 12, are on their feet for most of the 6- to 8-1/2-hour days, four times a week. These two weeks — uninterrupted by other commitments like school work and extracurricular activities — will be the most concentrated span of time the band can ready itself for competition season. Pouring rain won't hurt, especially if drill charts and music are protected in a binder like they're supposed to be. Sunscreen prevents most of a blazing August sun's damage, though most will walk away with tan lines from sneakers and sunglasses. Water breaks are awarded often, if not for brief durations.\n\nAcross the room, in the muted reflection from a closet door window, Brianna Cordi applies a healthy dose of sun protection to her face. It's only supposed to be 64 degrees in the morning, but she doesn't want to take the chance with her fair, freckled skin.\n\nShe's not thinking about this year's camp, but the next one. The 15-year-old Vestal resident is the junior drum major and spent four days of her summer at Drum Major Academy at West Chester University near Philadelphia. Her dad told her to look at what the college could offer for her future. Instead, she took away the skills she would need next year when she will be promoted to conduct the entire band in another set of music, other drills with different members.\n\nMusicians, guard and staff have finally come together for the first week of band camp. The eight days of camp acclimates both the band veterans and the rookies — who got their crash course last week — to this year's show.\n\nNew staff members have been added to the roster, each with their own specialties. The veterans are building from last year's experience; the rookies from last week. Band camp assesses what skills are there, what needs to be drilled further and what needs to change completely.\n\nWork with what you have\n\nIt's during band camp that a semblance of the show is put together, piecemeal if need be.\n\nAt this point, musicians have had their music since the end of July. Harris would love if everyone had memorized it by band camp, but he knows it won't always happen that way. Time is set aside for rehearsals for each of the band's four sections: woodwinds, brass, percussion and guard.\n\nWhen the 47 band students get together during rehearsals, most of the student performers transform into dots. Each marker on the drill charts shows the position where a band member must be to create the pretty designs and pictures viewers in the stands can see from above.\n\nThree days into band camp, and they have only half of the six drill charts they need for a full show. Because an outside party is creating the Vestal drills for them, Harris isn't surprised that the whole show isn't completed by band camp. As long as the band can get through all six movements by the end of Thursday, he's confident everything will fit together eventually.\n\n\"It's not bad; we'll get there\" seems to be a mantra for Harris and the rest of his staff. All of them have worked with marching bands before, either directing or performing in them.A polished show won't fully emerge until halfway through marching band season, they agree. By the end of September, volunteers will have built show props, and the band will have had plenty of time to fine tune and memorize all six movements of their show.\n\nGive them until the end of September, the staff assures. Maybe before — these kids are fast learners.\n\nOn the second day of camp, the band runs through the drill of the first movement, stepping to the beat of the song that will give their show wings: John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" From there, the music is meant to transport. Some songs, from Latin America, Korea and Africa, harken to foreign lands. Others are more literal to the practice of traveling: \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" by the Dropkick Murphys, and Ozzy Osbourne's \"Mama, I'm Coming Home.\"\n\nVisual coordinator Josh Jenkins scrutinizes the John Denver drill at the top of the 25 rows of bleachers facing the field.\n\nAfter the band's run-through of the first movement drills, black rubber pellets that cushion Dick Hoover Stadium's artificial turf are scattered about. A student calls to Harris near the back of the pack. She has a friend who plays tuba and would love to be in the marching band. Vestal's tuba — or the more marching-appropriate sousaphone — section was whittled last week from two players to a solo student.\n\nTrouble is, this friend goes to another school district.\n\n\"How soon can she move here?\" Harris asks, jokingly but with a hint of need in his voice. Other staff members pick up on the joke, knowing in the back of their minds that another sousaphone would help create the round, full sound they crave for the brass section this year.\n\nEven though the size of the band has increased significantly since last year's 27 members, there are always needs that can't be filled. Since the middle of the summer, five band members already dropped out. Harris is optimistic that will change once the school year begins and some students want an extracurricular activity to fill their time or college applications.\n\nBeyond the band\n\nBand camp is more than just about the musicians. The staff and various volunteers wait on the sidelines or aren't seen at all, conducting crucial work as the first performance draws near.\n\nA floor below the band room, rookies and veterans file in during camp sessions, getting pinned, tucked and otherwise fitted into their uniforms. Each outfit has up to seven pieces, and growing adolescents often don't fit last year's uniform.\n\nChristina Flores-Meyers kneels in front of one rookie trying on the overall-like black wool pants for the first time. They ride up a little too much, showing ankle that no one else is the band will be exposing. The Vestal band mom tugs on the bottom of the pants.\n\n\"I'm Christina, by the way,\" introducing herself to the girl she's kneeling in front of.\n\nIt's a practice Beth Wilton has done for years: Keeping the 17-year-old uniforms in condition for dozens of band members to wear. There's nothing a few pins or replacement buttons can't fix. It would cost about $350 to replace a single uniform for the band, she said, and there's no budget for that.\n\nOld isn't necessarily bad, as long as it fits the purpose. Zach Aiosa plays with a decades-old trombone his grandfather gave him. The bell is a different shade of brass than the rest of the horn. It's dinged and scratched. But staff members don't pay attention to the look of his instrument: They just compliment Zach on how he holds the horn at just the right angle.\n\nThe marching band does not have a budget. Before the start of each competition season, the band staff must assess what equipment has to be replaced or purchased for the year's show. Band boosters find out what the needs are, and depending on how much money is left from last year's fundraising, they can buy the mallets the percussion coordinator requested, or they can go without.\n\n\"It seems like we're doing fundraising every day,\" Harris says, glancing up from his Mac laptop, layered with multiple pages of various marching band equipment from online vendors.\n\nThe band lucked out this season: There's enough money to purchase the $2,000-plus equipment and music fees this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the biggest necessity is the copyrights to four of the six pieces of arranged music the marching band is performing in its \"Around the World: An 80 Day Journey\" show.\n\nHarris needs proof that he purchased $1,131 worth of copyright permission from two sheet music companies by Sunday. If he doesn't have the proof, they don't get to perform the music. No music, no show.\n\nAlone in his office on Wednesday, Harris struggles to find a phone number for customer service for each company. The credit card information the Band Aides gave him isn't going through, and he just wants to talk to a real person.\n\nA speaker in the adjacent band room thocks out a digital metronome to keep the pit orchestra in time as they rehearse in their section. Out in the high school parking lot, the rest of the band is trying to figure out the drill to movement two. Harris needs to be in several places at once.\n\nHe makes his choice: Leaving voice mails for each company, he throws on a faded gray Syracuse University baseball cap and grabs his green drill sheet binder. He needs to find out how the show is progressing.\n\nDressed in an aquamarine polo, brown cargo shorts and Nikes, Harris looks like some of the high school students he teaches. His short black hair is gelled and slightly flipped at the top of his forehead.\n\nThe director of the Vestal Marching Band usually speaks to his student performers from the ground — in the high school parking lot where they practice — but today this is different.\n\nThis is the parent performance, the first time the 49-member-strong band will perform in uniform in front of an audience. Parents, siblings and friends waved away flies in the muggy heat last Tuesday at dusk on the sideline of Sommer's Field behind the old Clayton Avenue Elementary School. Some sat in lawn chairs, most stood.\n\nHarris rushed up seven silver rungs to tower 12 feet above the crowd on a platform, usually a spot where the drum major conducts the band during a performance.\n\nToday, Harris isn't conducting musicians. His direction is aimed at the audience.\n\nThis group of special spectators will put on a show of their own, a performance in a performance. As the band plays six songs in eight minutes, he watches. At strategic points in the music, he claps. Loudly. So the parents get the hint and clap along.\n\nIf the parents clap at these places during the band's competitions, like the first one in Baldwinsville on Sept. 13, at the end of movements or after particularly impressive musical feats, others will follow their lead. Like the laugh at the end of a joke, it will signify that the band has done their job.\n\n\"We're more ready than anything this year, and you should be proud of your students,\" he tells the crowd of about 100.\n\nSaxophonist Brianna Cordi opens the show with a solo introducing \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" Mike Slilaty joins on clarinet, making it a duet. After the 16 measures of harmony, a beat of silence.\n\nHarris knows the rest of the band will join in at that moment. But the audience doesn't. He claps. Parents compound the applause, momentarily drowning out the entire band's entrance.\n\nFamilies are there to enjoy the result of their students' hard work over the three weeks of band camp before school starts. Harris has more on his mind. He makes mental notes\n\nThis is the second year the 29-year-old has directed the Vestal Marching Band. In a year, the band swelled from 27 members to nearly 50. This year, he said, the band is more prepared for competition season — leading to the New York State Field Band Conference Championship on Oct. 26 — than he ever expected. The students have memorized their music ahead of schedule. Most of the drill, or the marching sequence, is learned too.\n\nAt this point last year, the band wasn't ready to perform the whole show. During its first competition, exactly a year ago today, the band only marched half of the show. The second half of the 9-minute show was played standing still.\n\nThis group could compete tomorrow.\n\nWould they get a perfect score? Probably not, Harris said. But they are putting in the necessary effort.\n\nHarris will be the first one to say he's a perfectionist. You'll never hear him say, \"That was awesome\" to his band during rehearsals. A note could have been held longer. A crescendo could have been smoother. A stop in the music could have been cleaner.\n\nHarris grew up in Hamburg, just outside of Buffalo. He is the younger of two sons of a volunteer firefighter father who works at a beverage distribution company and mother who was a former teacher. As younger siblings often do, he got his start in music following his brother Kirk, five years his senior.\n\nAs a four-year-old, Harris joined his brother and sang in the choir at the St. James United Church of Christ. When Harris started playing the piano, he said he may have been influenced when he and his mother Jan would pick Kirk up from his own piano lessons. Kirk played trumpet in school; Harris followed when he entered fourth grade. Kirk, now a psychologist in Chicago, is still involved in music: Harris said he's an on-call doctor for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n\nWhen Harris started surpassing his brother and classmates in the Frontier Central School District's music programs he began to consider music as a career. In eighth grade, he successfully auditioned for a spot in a select high school band.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh, I'm pretty good at this.' It's nice to know what you want to do with the rest of your life when you're in high school,\" he said.\n\nFrom then on, Harris solicited the talents of others to play better. He spent the money he earned as a dishwasher and line cook to pay $40 to $50 per lesson. One instructor, a trumpeter who toured with Johnny Carson bandleader Doc Severinsen and gave lessons whenever he was home in Hamburg, spent an entire hour-long lesson making Harris play the same eight measures of music over and over. Anytime a note was missed, or a quarter note was held a beat too long, Harris had to start over.\n\n\"It was the hardest lesson of my life,\" he said. \"He proved his point which was every part of the note is important.\"\n\nThat trumpet lesson taught him that details do matter — both as you move from note to note in music as well as in life.\n\nBefore marching band competition, Harris scrutinizes each band member's ensemble. Do you have the right pins on your jacket collar? The Vestal \"V\" and a single gold bar for each year you've been in the band must be there. No? Go see a uniform parent and get it right. If there's anything but black socks in your black Dinkles, a brand of marching shoes, get another pair.\n\n\"I had a kid try to get by with white socks. It doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nEven though competitions haven't started, his band members get the message. A similar uniform check before Tuesday's parent performance revealed an eighth grader with no socks.\n\n\"It's the one thing you need!\" an exasperated bandmate chides him.\n\nOnce the uniforms are checked and the band goes through one last run through of music before marching onto turf fields from Baldwinsville, Corning, West Genesee or Syracuse, Harris has no more control.\n\nHe said he gets his music directing ideas from the late John Wooden, whose books sit on Harris' shelf at home. The 40-year basketball coach for UCLA would drill his team in practices, but remain quiet on the bench during games. Harris can only sit in the stands, watching the band he created since August.\n\n\"The kids are nervous for the performances, but I am way more nervous. I don't show it. There's nothing I can do at that point. It's all up to them. They'll do what they'll do. I've done everything I can to prepare them.\"\n\nAt a 2001 TED Talk, Wooden explained to the audience what he would tell his players: \"Just get out there, and whatever you're doing, do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that.\"\n\nHarris uses that kind of strategy with his band. He corralled the members of his band before giving them a half hour to change into their black, white and green uniforms. He didn't have a whiteboard marking defensive strategies like a basketball coach, just the drill charts in his well-used forest green binder. He even gives a pre-game speech — the words are never planned, but Harris tells the kids what he thinks they need to hear to get them energized, get their heads in the game.\n\n\"You need to have confidence in every note you play, every step you take,\" he said. \"Just put all your effort into it.\"\n\nHarris hates to admit it, but his parents' advice is rubbing off.\n\nThey're the same lessons he learned when he was younger, the ones he finds himself doling to his students in any of the Vestal band programs: Be organized. Do it right the first time so you don't have to do it a second time.\n\nThat last one, he said, he learned the hard way, cutting wood to fuel the wood-burning stove in his family's Hamburg home. In August, in the same month and at the same age as some of the 49 students that go through band camp, he'd slice through logs with his older brother Kirk and his father.\n\nCut the logs. Stack them, right, along the 150-yard expanse of grass behind the house. Sweep up the sawdust. Mow the lawn. Repeat, if need be. If one step wasn't done correctly, Harris's dad made them do it again.\n\n\"That's why I'll never have a wood-burning stove,\" he said. But, he admits, he'll never get a gas stove. A flip of the switch, and you get what you need. It's too easy. He and his wife Katy, 28, currently heat their Willseyville, Tioga County, home in the winter with a black coal-fueled stove.\n\nYears later, in the parking lot of the Vestal High School, he puts his band through a similar exercise during its band camp. March the first movement. Stop. Confer with the staff. Change a step. Repeat, if need be.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, there will be a lot of repeating steps. School has started. Competition season is approaching. Seven weeks until Syracuse.\n\n***\n\nHarris is still hesitant about fatherhood.\n\nThe band students he's used to directing can be as young as 12. But when it comes to his own son, one-month-old Brennan, he's in new territory.\n\nHarris remembers changing Brennan's diaper for the first time. Well, not changing it: watching someone else do it.\n\nHe asked Katy in the first few days of August just after Brennan came home for the first time if he could watch her complete the task in the baby's room on the first floor of their Willseyville home. He never had younger cousins or siblings to take care of. He's the youngest in his family. Katy babysat young nephews. He asked for the same advice from her when he held Brennan for the first time. When he put Brennan in his crib. How do I do that? I don't want to hurt him? Can you do it first?\n\n\"I think he's more critical than he needs to be,\" Katy said.\n\nHe needed to learn. Like his high school lessons, he said he needs experience to learn.\n\nHarris himself never participated in a show band like the one he's directing now. Most of his personal experience was singing or playing on a stage, in a uniform of a black-and-white tuxedo for the Ithaca College Wind Ensemble, or black jackets and jeans for the Ithacappella all-male singing group. He directed the Erie County Fair Marching Band during his summers as an Ithaca College student, but they marched in parades.\n\nIn Vestal, he doesn't know how to execute the plie or cone spins that the seven-member color guard performs while the band opens the show with \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" That's why 24-year-old Heidi Conroy was brought in. Conroy performed in the Vestal color guard and winter guard as a high schooler herself.\n\nSome days in band camp, when a student was absent while going through the movements, Harris placed himself on their \"dots\" and followed Ithaca College sophomore and visual captain Josh Jenkin's instructions. He took the place of bass clarinet player Brianna Hawkins or Josh Lewis on baritone saxophone, filling in the spots of absent band members. While he wouldn't play an instrument, he marched, learning the drills one step, one rotation at a time.\n\nHe did forget sunscreen, a rule he drills into the students' heads. He has a band tan he jokes Brennan didn't inherit, like his eyes or Katy's nose.\n\nWith the new baby, there isn't much down time these days for Greg and Katy Harris, who is an athletic trainer for the Cornell University women's ice hockey team. When Brennan sleeps in his mechanized rocker they use the one-hour breaks to wash dishes and maybe shower. That's become optional with parenthood.\n\nThe couple keeps a Google calendar, meshing her hockey games with his performances. For the entire month of September, there are only two days that aren't marked with events. They land on weekdays — days Harris will be holed up in the music wing in Vestal anyway, directing one of the high school's five bands or after school with the marching band.\n\nThey keep their iPhones on at all times. Katy could get a call at 2 a.m. from a hockey player who dislocated a knee cap. Harris answers emails from parents who have their own jobs during the day and can only communicate at night.\n\nFree time is something the couple attempts to get, but don't often give themselves. They'll watch TV after work sometimes — one afternoon \"The Simpsons\" marathon plays on mute in the background. Usually in the summer, Harris and Katy take a month vacation to Hawaii where Katy's aunt and uncle live. This year was tough, though: Brennan was two weeks late and they couldn't travel more than an hour from the hospital.\n\nA lot of Harris's down time is in his electric blue SUV, driving the 40-minute commute each way from his job in Vestal. He never listens to music in the car. He downloads sports podcasts on his phone, \"The Dan Patrick Show.\" When he was a student at Ithaca College, he never spent time outside of classes or rehearsals in the Whalen Center for Music.\n\n\"I had to spend all my time with music people I would go crazy,\" he said. \"They talk about music all the time, I needed something else to do.\"\n\nHe tries to keep Sundays open, too, whenever possible. Even if he's up until 11 p.m. on Saturdays picking up after a competition or traveling on a bus home with the rest of the band, he'll be at a Buffalo Bills home game on Sunday with his father. Tailgating in the morning, sitting in the third tier, 21 rows up. It's something he's done since he was 11 years old.\n\nIf Brennan grows up and doesn't play sports, his parents said that's fine. If he doesn't play music, that's fine.\n\nHarris pauses. He considers what he's learned being a musician. Dedication. Passion. Friendship. The same lessons the kids in his marching band are learning right now, or at least what he hopes they're taking out of the experience.\n\n\"No, actually, that's not fine, he has to try.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, Sara Zuwiyya seems like your typical busy high school senior.\n\nThe 17-year-old Vestal High School student juggles classes with clubs, sports and volunteer work. Her life plays out in two calendars: Classwork is dictated in her school agenda and cross-country meets, engineering club meetings and other activities are tracked on her phone.\n\nBut Saturday evenings and at least twice a week after school, Zuwiyya commands the attention of fellow students as senior drum major of the Vestal Marching Band, serving as the main student leader in that group of nearly 50 high school and middle school instrumentalists.\n\nUsually, Friday nights are free of homework, but she recently gave herself a Friday assignment: Think of a salute, the first glimpse the audience will have of the marching band's six New York State Field Band Conference competitions.\n\nZuwiyya will stand taller than any other member in the band, aided by a 72-inch aluminum podium, dressed in an all-black uniform. She's the only band member who gets new, crisp white gloves before a show, colors contrasting to show off her conducting hands.\n\nTo her, working on the salute isn't homework. It's perfecting her role in a band she's participated in since middle school. This year, though, she's not playing on the field with other flutists. She's trying to make her mark as the highest-ranking senior in a band growing in size and stability.\n\nHer older brother, Joe, now 20, was on that same podium for three years as senior drum major. Zuwiyya wants to leave behind her own legacy now.\n\n\"I watched him, and learned from him but I want to show what I can do,\" she said.\n\nShe gets her chance the next day. Music director Dan Miller prompts a run-through of the entire show during a Saturday morning practice in the Vestal High School parking lot with the dictum familiar to Zuwiyya and most competitive bands:\n\n\"Performing their 2014 program, 'Around the World: An 80-day Journey,' the Vestal Marching Band, led by drum major Sara Zuwiyya. Drum major, is your band ready?\"\n\nZuwiyya straightens out her 5-foot-3-inch frame. The first 16 beats of the six-movement show are hers.\n\nTime to put Friday night's work on saluting to good use.\n\nShe turns her back to the 49-member-strong band to face the audience — imaginary in the parking lot. There will be people in the stands for the band's first competition of the season in Baldwinsville a few hours from that practice. There will be judges waiting to officiate the show.\n\nShe sharply strikes her first pose: Left hand pointed flat at her left hip, while the right hand is positioned at the corner of her eye, harkening back to the military roots of marching bands. But she interjects some fun: Tucked into the sleeve of her all-black uniform will be a paper airplane. Zuwiyya will toss it into the audience, hinting at the 8-minute travel-themed performance.\n\nThere's no place for paper airplanes during this rehearsal: Rain and 50-degree weather have made the practice miserable for a lot of the band members. Many would rather be sleeping right now.\n\nZuwiyya pushes the sleeves of her navy windbreaker up to her elbows. Rain soaks the bottom six inches of her brown corduroy pants. Wisps of her long brown hair stick to her forehead and neck, plastered by rain.\n\nShe's not thinking about being warm. She's more concerned about her band seeing her. Mostly her hands.\n\nIf the band can't see her hands, it's as if she's not conducting at all. If she's not conducting, she's not doing her job.\n\nThe senior drum major is the student with the most authority in the band, following the band director and staff members in the chain of command. When band staff sits in the stands during a show, a drum major takes the lead. She conducts the band through all its performances, takes attendance on the bus ride to each show and is expected to be a role model for all other band members.\n\nNext in line is the junior drum major — the \"vice president\" for the senior, says band director Greg Harris. This year, that title falls to 15-year-old junior Brianna Cordi, of Vestal. She will take Zuwiyya's place when the senior graduates. She practices Zuwiyya's salute, in case of emergency. If the senior drum major can't make a performance, Cordi is on deck.\n\nAfter Zuwiyya's salute, Cordi will pick up on her cue. She introduces the band in another way, playing the alto saxophone solo that leads in John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\"\n\nWith just five weeks until the New York State Field Band Conference Championships, Zuwiyya knows a little about what's coming for her last season with the band.\n\nThe announcers at each of the competitions will recognize, and mess up, her last name. When her brother was drum major she can't remember a time when they got the name right. (For the record, it's Zuh-wee-yah, with a slight emphasis on the second syllable.)\n\nShe also knows there will be a lot of juggling on top of conducting. Both of the drum majors, on top of multiple extracurriculars and academic requirements, are also athletes. Cordi plays softball and bowls, while Zuwiyya is on the Vestal cross-country team. There will be a Saturday when Zuwiyya has to run in a meet in Rochester and drive with her mom for 1.5 hours to make it to a marching band performance in Camillus.\n\nWhen Harris took command a director of the Vestal Marching Band last year, Zuwiyya was already slated to be the junior drum major, appointed by the band director that came before him. He was concerned about her cross-country running and band commitments within hours of each other.\n\n\"Can you manage all of this?\" he asked her at the end of last year. She assured him, yes. Harris hasn't been disappointed yet.\n\nWhen choosing drum majors, Harris has a whole application process. Candidates discuss their drum major aspirations through preliminary questions on paper: Name, instrument, why do you want to be drum major.\n\nZuwiyya and Cordi can answer that last one in a similar way: I want to see what I can accomplish.\n\nThen there's an interview process. Last year, Harris interviewed two individuals to fill the junior drum major spot. He wants individuals who will lead, not dictate. He expects the drum majors to assume responsibility for several tasks, conducting the group, setting up and striking the podium before and after practice.\n\nHe admits that leadership can be difficult, since the students in the band spend most of their days together in classes already. It's a balance between being liked and being respected.\n\n\"I never ask them to be in charge of the band,\" Harris said. \"They're supporting, not telling.\"\n\nHe knows drum majors will not start the marching band season knowing everything. Not many high school students have experience conducting and leading a group of their peers. Neither Zuwiyya nor Cordi have assumed a formal leadership role despite their multiple activities.\n\nup of their peers. Neither Zuwiyya nor Cordi have assumed a formal leadership role despite their multiple activities.\n\nThat's where Lauren Reynolds and her staff comes in.\n\nReynolds, the director of bands for Central Connecticut State University, is one of eight lead staff members for the George N. Parks Drum Major Academy. Several workshops are held during the summer to get band leadership from across the country in shape for their impending seasons. The 14-hour days were filled with lessons on conducting, marching techniques and leadership skills. The camp, Reynolds said, is less about teaching the technique, but teaching to teach.\n\nZuwiyya and Cordi both attended a version of the academy for four days this summer in West Chester University in Pennsylvania. This summer, they were two of about 300 drum majors from high schools and colleges from across the country.\n\n\"They are, by and large, the best of the best,\" said Reynolds, a 32-year-old Glastonbury, Conn. resident. \"You rarely encounter a lack of commitment with drum majors.\"\n\nCordi, for one, still carries around the pink notebook from the camp. In the first 20 pages or so, in pink pen, she's drawn conducting diagrams. She practices the movements at home in her free time, knowing that now her place is on the field, not the conducting podium occupied by Zuwiyya.\n\nCordi won't adopt the senior drum major status until she starts her last year of high school. Her first year of band, she was goaded into the program by a family friend. Even then, she knew the authority and responsibility that came with being in the top position.\n\n\"(The drum major) was perfection on a podium,\" she said. \"That's what I strive for — perfection.\"\n\nConducting, Zuwiyya admits, is her biggest shortcoming.\n\nShe's been musically inclined since the fourth grade, the first year she could join a music ensemble at a Vestal school. Tempo, crescendo and staccato are not foreign words to her. It's combining the technical aspects of music with the emotions of the show, she said.\n\n\"If someone is dancing with angry music on, it's different than when they're dancing with slower music,\" she said. \"I can do the style, and then I can conduct. It's hard to do both.\"\n\nSlowly but surely, Zuwiyya has made steps to be an accurate, expressive conductor: She moves to the music. The slower \"Arirang\" becomes a solo waltz. Faster tunes makes her bounce from one foot to the other.\n\nCordi remembers Zuwiyya's brother Joe on the drum major stand. \"He was crazy, dancing and jumping around all the time,\" she said.\n\nBefore the Baldwinsville show, Zuwiyya thinks about the speed of her own dance, the tempo at which she'll conduct Ozzy Ozbourne's faster \"Mama, I'm Coming Home,\" her favorite because of its speed and the picked-up energy the band adopts while playing it.\n\nShe second-guesses herself. Her moment of a pause causes half the band to start marching while the other half wait for their real cue.\n\nShe'll later convene with music director Miller on the podium, discussing the best way to give the band its rhythm. He will suggest to Zuwiyya to keep her hand movements crisp and sharp. A flowery hand gesture may look pretty, but it's harder for a band member 50 feet away to determine when Zuwiyya wants one note to end and another to begin.\n\n\"It's better to mess up now than at a competition,\" comforts Emily Goldenberg, a 16-year-old Vestal junior who can see the frustration on Zuwiyya's face. She and the rest of the pit percussion players are physically closest to the drum major during the performances, xylophones and marimbas just feet away from the conducting podium.\n\nZuwiyya doesn't want to make excuses. The goal she set for herself this season is \"lead by example.\" She doesn't want hesitation to be her legacy.\n\n\"It's better never than ever.\"\n\nTelevision producer, age 45.\n\nMedical records manager, 53.\n\nGrocery store employee, 43.\n\nCollege student, 18.\n\nFar-flung and on different paths, this diverse group is a handful from the hundreds who share a common past. All, with pride, call themselves alumni of the Vestal Marching Band.\n\nOn Oct. 11,the current band will host the Golden Circle of Bands competition, the only home show Vestal has before the Oct. 26 championship show. Alumni will be at Dick Hoover Field on Oct 11, selling green-and-gold band bling and reliving their marching days through the six performing bands.\n\nOthers will watch progress from afar, keeping up with the 453 bandies that compose the Vestal High School Marching Band Facebook page.\n\nTo many alumni, being in the band wasn't just another activity taking up space on a college application. Days of band camp, hours of after-school practices, the moments of clarity, the excitement of a season going well make up their memories of the band.\n\nAnd this season is going well for the Vestal band, which has increased its score by about three points each week, ranking the group higher and higher in its band division in the state.\n\nOut of all that, the alumni know from experience that this year's group of 50 students in the band will take away many intangibles.\n\n\"In everything I do, I'm working the hardest I can, striving to be as good as possible,\" said one alumna, Wendy Wilkins. \"Band taught me that.\"\n\nLife's lessons learned\n\nTucked away in Wilkins' bedroom closet in Los Angeles, 2,700 miles from her Vestal childhood home, is a broken memory. Broken, but still good.\n\nLike a threadbare baby blanket or stuffing-less teddy bear, 45-year-old Wilkins kept her trusty band prop for sentimental reasons. A member of the color guard, Wilkins won't give up her fake rifle, a band memory that goes back to 1983.\n\nThat wooden rifle was well-used by her until 11th grade, when she missed a throw at a band competition show. She has since repaired the split wood between the butt and barrel.\n\nAbout 30 years separate Wilkins from her formal rifle-spinning days. Vestal High School memories that shine brightest are the band bus trips, her friend, a color guard captain, who snagged the Homecoming Queen title, and the self-esteem that would swell inside her.\n\n\"Band was like telling the best joke at the party, and everyone laughing, and having that happen over and over again,\" Wilkins said in an interview from her California home. \"It was my own personal high.\"\n\nIn band, she said, no one in the 300-strong group made fun of her \"big butt\" like some students in the away-game crowds. She found her place, despite her \"sports hero\" father wishing she stuck to soccer, softball, anything other than the band. He came around after seeing her perform in the first home football game of her freshman year.\n\nBand is where she learned to work in a group, not compete for a higher score or faster time as she would when she swam for the high school.\n\nThat perspective also geared her to root for the underdog, which Los Angeles is full of, she assures. She's given rides to fresh arrivals to the big city, harkening to her days as a mentor with the Vestal Marching Band. If they look green, help.\n\nShe even sneaks in some of her band inspiration into her work: As a freelance television writer and director, she's worked on the sets of HBO's \"Deadwood\" and \"Six Feet Under.\" Whenever she can, Wilkins said she tries to inject color guard references into scripts. She just finished a book about being in band camp, called \"Mark Time Move.\"\n\nFrom performer to parent\n\nMark Merges doesn't need his old trumpet to remember his days in the Vestal Marching Band. He still has it, though.\n\nSitting in the high school's Room 114 — Vestal band headquarters — on a recent weeknight, he was one of about a dozen band parents hammering out the whens, wheres and hows of the upcoming Golden Circle competition. Parents in the Band Aides basically run the Saturday show.\n\nOn this evening, the parental discussion focused on where performers can change in and out of their uniforms. There's talk about using a Vestal school gymnasium, with the divider pulled across the center of the room. One side for girls, the other for boys.\n\nMerges, 53, of Vestal, tunes his sarcasm to the right pitch. Dry humor was a vital tactic in band, he said. It kept the bullies at bay and was a way to playfully haze any fresh-mouthed rookies. He kept the lighthearted cynicism — as he has with the horn — with him in life. It's a good counterpoint to his work as a health information manager at United Health Services.\n\n\"Why do they need a whole room? Isn't that what buses are for?\"\n\nWhen he was in the band, his changing room was on wheels. Often, Merges said the band was late in their rush to competitions, and had to change into their uniforms on the bus. It was a ritual that shocked his World War II veteran father who chaperoned one of these trips, blindsided when he saw teenagers undressing in front of him.\n\nBut Merges knew the work that went with band. When a director told you to stand at attention, you did it. Merges was in the marching band during its militaristic days from his time in the Africa Road Junior High Marching Band until he graduated from the high school in 1979.\n\nMerges' daughter, Molly, joined the band because of her dad's stories. Molly, 17, is this year's color guard section leader and in her final foray with the marching band.\n\nMark Merges has more than stories from his days in the Vestal Marching Band. Tucked away in a yellow folder — a price sticker dictating the folder's price of 16 cents when he bought it for a middle school science class — he has saved competition programs and old photographs of Jazz Band.\n\nShakos, chickens and instruments pinpoint Merges' friends in those aging pictures. In the high school were different cliques. The jocks, the cheerleaders and greasers. Merges just fit with the marching band kids.\n\n\"You just have a sense of purpose when you're in band,\" he said. \"You had your job, and everyone depends on you to do that.\"\n\nJust as he needs to coordinate volunteers this year on the day of the Golden Circle. He'll be armed with a walkie-talkie, moving volunteers around and solving any last-minute crises.\n\nDon't expect him to be free during Vestal's performance though. He'll be in the stands, watching his daughter's last home show.\n\nFrom performer to director\n\nTo Mark Dowches, marching band was one of the hardest things to experience.\n\nThe two-time band alumnus played mellophone with the marching band until 1989, preceded by two sisters. A dozen years later, one of his old music directors asked him to join the Vestal Marching Band staff. Two years before Greg Harris took the helm of the band, 43-year-old Dowches ended up directing the band.\n\nIn that time, he said the band was at its lowest membership, at 26 students in 2012. The year before, floods from Tropical Storm Lee ripped through the practice fields.\n\nBut the band rallied. Twenty-six students took over the Carrier Dome — where Dowches left so many memories during his own championship competitions — with a makeup heavy Tim Burton-themed show. The show in Corning following the flood garnered the most applause for the Vestal band Dowches ever heard. Be it the performance or the resilience of the group, Vestal left a mark.\n\nEven after a heart attack on April Fool's Day in 2010, stemming from over-exerting a past shoulder surgery, the Owego resident recovered in time for the St. Patrick's Day parade the following year. The band students were some of the first people at his bedside, he said.\n\n\"Being part of the marching band is the most memorable thing I've been through,\" he said.\n\nGaby Baxter remembers those tough days, as one of only two dozen students a few years ago. She followed her older brother Jeffery and sister Hattie into positions of band leadership: All three, within the last eight years, were drum majors. They managed bands ranging from 26 performers to nearly 100.\n\nLining the wall of the upstairs hallway in her Vestal home, the Baxters have eight framed show photos of the marching band, set in two rows of four. The 18-year-old adopts a higher, more excited pitch in her voice pointing out some of the friends she's made: Mama NeNe, Chi Chi. Nicknames for her might-as-well-be siblings, she said.\n\nBeing in a band connected Gaby to people she had no history with. In a tennis elective she's taking at SUNY Broome Community College, she connected to local graduates who played in a school district's parade band. They're all part of an extended family, she said.\n\n\"You have your real family, then you have your band family,\" is her simple explanation. Her parents, Jeffery and Edwina, would agree. They spent their nights creating props for the band, chaperoning at band parties. Now that all their children have grown up, out of the marching band, they don't know what to do with their nights.\n\nEven though a Baxter isn't in the band anymore, they'll be in the stands at the Golden Circle. Gaby may not feel the same rush of nervous energy as she did when she competed, but the excitement is still there.\n\n\"I can't wait for the home show.\"\n\nWarren Chan had an hour to himself last Tuesday.\n\nOne hour.\n\nSome days, that's all he gets.\n\nThe 16-year-old Vestal High School senior started class at 8 a.m. — most Tuesdays he's at the school an hour earlier for Jazz Band, but he missed the last rehearsal. When school gets out at 3 p.m., he's off to the track to work out for two hours.\n\nHis special hour is from 5 to 6 p.m., when he can rest and eat. But then he breaks out his trumpet for a 2 1/2 hour practice with the Vestal Marching Band.\n\nLike many of the students in the band, Chan has a life outside of the 80-day journey he's taken with 48 marching band mates this year.\n\nChan's multiple responsibilities sometimes make it difficult to concentrate during marching band rehearsals. He admits when he marches, his mind wanders. He thinks about his AP chemistry lab homework. Or an upcoming track practice. Boy Scouts. Science Olympiad. Sometimes puppies — huskies, mostly, because they're just cool.\n\nBut when he's in a competition, he knows to focus on doing his best.\n\n\"We were supposed to come up with goals at the beginning of the season. Mine was to play a perfect show,\" he said. When asked if he's played one yet, a half-stifled laugh ends in the word, \"No.\"\n\nDays are counting down to the New York State Field Band Conference championships, the final destination for the Vestal Marching Band. The band started its competition season with the highest score for a first performance — 64.95 — in a decade. Since that Baldwinsville show, the numbers have only gone up. It's nearly impossible to reach the ultimate score of 100, but each band in the conference tries for it.\n\nScoring higher each week means not making the same mistakes twice. Each band director receives audio, video and written notes from each competition judge. Director Greg Harris and his staff go through this documentation much like football coaches after a game and distills down suggestions for students in hand-typed pages.\n\nStaff still drill the students just as they had in band camp, but the priorities have changed. Instead of teaching and re-teaching straight-leg technique, for example, the band is perfecting and polishing the minute details of the show.\n\nA judge at the Golden Circle of Bands competition last weekend wished the rhythm echoing from African drums, played in the third movement, were in sync with each other. Harris latched on to the suggestion at a recent rehearsal, spending nearly 20 minutes on lining up the beats.\n\n\"Make sure your right hand comes a foot off the drum before you hit it,\" he instructs. \"Is it a foot up? Believe me, it will help.\"\n\nBut even Harris gets distracted when he thinks about his other responsibilities, after the marching band season is over.\n\nA week after the Syracuse championships, there will be auditions for this year's high school musical, \"Big Fish.\" Harris will sit in during student auditions, and organize a pit orchestra of mostly adults, given the high level of challenging music. Then there's the almost daily fundraising for the band's winter field trip to perform at Disney.\n\nHe knows the students in band are under the same pressures.\n\n\"I'd say it's rare when a student isn't in another band or another musical group,\" Harris said. \"If they're not, it's usually a scheduling problem. They have too much else going on.\"\n\nBut this week is the week.\n\nAlmost everything else, barring an emergency, takes a back seat to marching band. A stuffy nose or sports practice won't get you out of the final week of band rehearsal.\n\nEvery day from Monday through Sunday, excluding Tuesday as the only day of rest, is a marching band day. Three days of rehearsal — Monday, Wednesday, Thursday — to polish what needs to be polished. One Friday football game to play for a home crowd. A Saturday morning to pack up the equipment buses and have a final pep talk.\n\nThen there's Sunday. The end of the 80-day journey, when focus is essential.\n\nCompetitions, even rehearsals, are far more difficult than practicing music on the Vestal High School stage. There are more variables, more distractions, more ways to mess up.\n\n\"When they're outside, they have a lot more to deal with. They need to march, they need to watch Sara (Zuwiyya, the senior drum major), which is harder out here,\" music director Dan Miller said.\n\nChan, a six-year veteran with the marching band, helps his peers during those outdoor practices, particularly the ones marching near him.\n\nDuring the first day of band camp in August, visual captain Joshua Jenkins quietly praised Chan's marching abilities to the other staff members. Chan's skills at following marching band commands won him the Golden Dinkle, the top prize for the best marcher in the band, besting a musician who won the award two years in a row.\n\nHis name will still adorn the trophy after he goes off to college next year — he's hoping to study engineering at the United States Coast Guard Academy, but he won't know if he'll be Connecticut-bound until December.\n\nDuring that same long Tuesday, Chan gave tips to freshman rookie Yuval Tessman-Bar-On on dressing her lines, insuring she stays in the same formation with everyone else instead of being inches ahead of everyone. Take smaller steps, don't lunge into it.\n\n\"This year is a lot easier for me, I know the commands, I know how to march, so I'm able to help others more,\" he said.\n\nThe sun tips over the horizon in central New York at 7:29 a.m., and a convoy of three buses and one truck rumbles up Interstate 81, just south of Tully, in the dim dawn light.\n\nThe members of the Vestal Golden Bears Marching Band on board have already been going for hours. Ahead of them lies a very long, very big day: This stretch of road will lead them to Syracuse University's Carrier Dome and the culmination of three months of planning, practice and painstaking work for the students and their leaders.\n\nThis day, Oct. 26, is the 41st annual New York State Field Band Conference Championship, and Vestal is playing to win.\n\nMany of the teens on the bus have been awake since 4 a.m. They're shaking off the nerves with a group singalong of Queen's epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" then the Village People's \"YMCA.\"\n\nBrian Miller, a 16-year-old junior drummer, stands with arms aloft, leading his fellow students through the paces: Y, M, C and A. The jitters don't disappear entirely, but the antics help keep the mood light and the energy flowing.\n\nThey'll need that stamina for the hours ahead. The competition, which draws 52 bands from across the state in six divisions, begins at 8 a.m. and doesn't end until well after 10 p.m. The bands will be judged by a 10-member panel that will evaluate the musical and visual aspects of each marching ensemble.\n\nThe day marks the end of a grueling 80-day journey for these 49 students. The Vestal band's season began on a warm and sunny August day and will end in the windy chill of a rainy October night.\n\n\"It's just sad that it's going to be over,\" says Jamie Wu, 16, a junior mellophone player from Apalachin, in the early Sunday hours.\n\nOver three months, they've logged nearly 100 hours of practice, five competitions and one parade. They've learned the steps and the notes and the timing, but they've also learned to glide across the field in one seamless transformation after another, to be a part of something bigger than themselves. The end result is teamwork in the truest sense.\n\n\"These kids and these parents are the nicest people,\" said Joseph Cordi, father of junior drum major Bianna Cordi. \"Everyone draws so close.\"\n\nAn early start\n\nAt 5 that morning, 29-year-old band director Greg Harris — crisply dressed in a Vestal-green button-down and black tie — unlocks his office, settles behind his desk and waits for the slow, sleepy trickle of students into the adjacent band room.\n\nAmong the first to arrive is 14-year-old freshman Grace Kim, of Apalachin, who plays the alto-saxophone, at 5:15 a.m.\n\n\"It's a beautiful time to be awake,\" she says with a touch of humor.\n\nBy 5:30, most of the the student musicians, color guards and their chaperones have arrived, grabbing muffins, cookies, bananas and drinks from a table near the whiteboard and breaking off into groups, mostly boys with boys and girls with girls.\n\nHarris calls roll, then it's time to load the instruments and props into the truck and one of the three buses. Band members and chaperones are divided between two remaining buses for the 80-minute ride up the interstate.\n\nVestal will compete in Small Schools Class 3, which also includes Union-Endicott High School and is the day's first category to perform. Vestal is scheduled to take the field at 9:57 a.m. Vestal band members won't be able to catch the U-E performance; there's a run-through and other preparations to attend to.\n\nThe buses arrive at the staging area, Syracuse's Skytop, a little after 8 a.m. A steady rain falls, and a brisk, wind-driven rain whips through the open parking lot, making it feel much colder than the 46 degrees registered by the thermometer. Some parents seek shelter inside the school buses, but the band members don't have that luxury.\n\nThe brass and woodwinds separate into different corners of the lot for a short practice. The percussionists unload their instruments. Rainwater begins to puddle on the bars of the marimba, and when the band members' mallets hit home, they send out sprays of frigid water.\n\nConditions aren't the best for the practice, but Harris has seen worse in years past. And no matter how cold or miserable it is on competition day, conditions always seem far worse in the Skytop staging area, Harris said. They soldier on, even as other marching bands do the same just yards away.\n\nFinally, the woodwinds join the brass and drums for a final practice before the trip over to the Carrier Dome. Rain is now coming down in sheets. Band uniforms are growing damp.\n\nThey gather in a far corner of the parking lot, and the black shakos — band headwear — are fitted on top of their heads. The plumes — the white, feather-like accessory — are placed on top of the shakos. The students are now ready for a full-band 15-minute practice, their last before they depart for the brief bus ride to the Carrier Dome.\n\nAssistant band director Dan Miller bends down to hear the trombone and makes his final assessment.\n\n\"Do not change they way you've been,\" he tells the band.\n\nAt the Carrier Dome minutes later, event coordinators shepherd them through an air lock. The percussionists bound for the pit are escorted to the field, while others enter one of the locker rooms.\n\nFinal preparations are made. Green and gold accessories are placed on the uniforms. Only minutes to go before the balance of the band is ready to take to the field.\n\nHarris gathers his crew.\n\n\"Seniors, thank you for buying into a system,\" he says. \"I couldn't be more proud. You exceeded expectations.\"\n\nDecked out in green, black and gold, the band exits the dressing room and enters the field. Anticipation mounts. The dome's south-side lower level is filled with spectators. Bands that have already performed sit on the dome's other side.\n\nLater, Josh Lewis, 16, a baritone saxophonist from Vestal, will reflect on the moment: \"When I first walked in there, I was nothing but nerves. But then I said to myself, 'Let's just do this,' and the nerves just went away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowtime\n\nThe performance begins with a soft duet of clarinet and saxophone playing the opening notes to John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\" Barely 20 seconds in, the whole band swells and sways, its members weaving in and out among each other in the intricate and highly choreographed routine they've spent months perfecting.\n\nBy this time, a nervous Harris sits back to watch. \"I just try to enjoy it,\" he says.\n\nThe 13-minute performance, named \"Around the World: An 80 Day Journey,\" is both a global-themed music extravaganza and a nod to the band's 80 days of preparations. It features six songs, including \"Shipping Up to Boston,\" traditional African, Korean and Korwan numbers, and ending with Ozzy Osborne's \"Mama I'm Coming Home.\"\n\nTwo on-field competition judges are noting strengths and faults on a digital recorder as they weave in and out of the band formations, sometimes stepping in front of band members whose precise steps have been practiced over and over again.\n\n\"That's really hard,\" Mike Schott says of the on-field judging. \"It's also stressful when you're trying not to mess up. Sometimes you'll be hearing them making criticisms, and you're somewhat offended.\"\n\n\"We tell them to ignore them,\" Miller adds. \"It's part of what they have to learn to deal with.\"\n\nAnd just like that, three months of work is distilled into 13 minutes of showtime.\n\n\"This was easily the best performance of the year,\" saxophonist Lewis says.\n\nExhilarated, exhausted group members mug for group pictures, share trays of nachos from the concession stand, catch their collective breath and await the results.\n\nA winning spirit\n\nMembers of bands in the Small School Class 3 and Small School Class 2 categories gather on the field. They stretch from end zone to end zone.\n\nTwelfth- though ninth-place finishers are announced. Vestal isn't among them. Then, the announcer names the eighth-place winners: \"The Golden — Falcons.\"\n\nThe Golden Bears are still safe.\n\nBy finishing higher than eighth, the Vestal band has already surpassed its best performance in at least seven years.\n\nSeventh place goes to the Marcus Whitman Wildcats.\n\nAnd then, with a score of 76.4 out of 100, the Vestal marching band comes in sixth.\n\nUltimately, the highly respected U-E marching band takes the top prize. But Vestal's score and rank was the school's best showing since 2007.\n\n\"We shattered the record,\" said Sara Zuwiyya, senior drum major. \"I'm happy that we put on our best show.\"\n\nLater, band members saw it this way: They were the fourth-smallest band, but their score was better than seven other bands in their category. They rose two spots from last year's eighth-place finish. Put simply, members said, they put on a show that made them proud.\n\nWhat happens next? The band heads back to Vestal, stopping en route for a celebratory lunch in Cortland. They unload their equipment and stash it in the band room or the so-called \"dungeon\" space. Then the band members, such a cohesive unit on the field just hours earlier, scatter into cars and head toward home.\n\nThey'll reconvene for a few more parades, but this is the final page of the band calendar their director printed up for them at the beginning of the school year. There will be no more practices and no more competitions.\n\nOf course, the band members have plenty to do; they're still students, after all. Take drum major Zuwiyya, who plans to fill her schedule with college applications (she expects to enter an engineering undergraduate program next August) and catch up on homework.\n\nBut for the marching band, Harris says, \"There is no next week.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/02/20/vacancies-at-milwaukee-public-schools-impact-vulnerable-students-most/78329038007/", "title": "Vacancies at Milwaukee Public Schools impact vulnerable students ...", "text": "Walk into almost any school in Milwaukee, and there will be someone missing.\n\nIt could be the paraprofessional meant to greet the school bus, the secretary who is supposed to log attendance, the math teacher who should be handing out worksheets or the accountant who should be logging the school’s spending.\n\nIt could be a gym teacher, a counselor, a special education teacher, an aide — or, in the case of at least one school, all four.\n\nIt’s a national problem that few have tried to measure and a local problem that led to two crises at Milwaukee Public Schools last spring, followed by an exodus of top district officials.\n\nThe school district is riddled with vacant staff positions. It's not obvious from the outside. Wisconsin school districts don’t have to report unfilled positions. But the losses, cracks in the foundation, are felt each day by those around them.\n\nSchools nationwide have struggled with vacancies, particularly since the onset of the pandemic. For MPS, they've become part of a money-saving strategy. Expecting that around 11% of its staff positions will be unfilled at any time, MPS spends millions in salary money elsewhere each year.\n\nNick Sinram, the budget director for MPS, said by spending these savings through the school year, the district avoids having to cut jobs or ending up with excess funds at the end of the year that would go into savings, rather than into classrooms.\n\n“We see it as a strategy to try and cope with the difficulty of the national teacher shortage and the job market,” Sinram said.\n\nThe effects of a long-term vacancy are similar to a job cut. But unlike planned, public cuts, vacancies happen quietly and haphazardly. A Journal Sentinel analysis found the vacancies disproportionately affect students with disabilities, Black students and students from low-income families.\n\nThe vacancies signal conditions in the schools that make it difficult to recruit and retain staff. On recent years' exit surveys, about a third of staff leaving higher-vacancy MPS schools said working conditions or a lack of support caused them to resign. The vacancies then multiply the challenges for the staff and students who remain.\n\n“We have to figure out something to address it. Otherwise, there’s real questions about who’s going to be teaching our kids,” Adria Maddaleni, then the chief human resources officer for MPS, told the Journal Sentinel in December.\n\nShe left the job a week later.\n\nMPS expects to save $70 million on unfilled positions\n\nSinram said the district has been unable to fill about 11% of its staff positions in recent years.\n\nExpecting the same rate for this school year, Sinram said the district plans to save about $70 million on salaries and benefits that will go unclaimed for those empty positions.\n\nThat’s $70 million that MPS can spend somewhere else. In recent years, this pot of unspent salary money has helped the district afford cost-of-living raises and other costs rising with inflation.\n\nBut the arrangement, while keeping the district's budget balanced, takes a toll on schools with more vacancies. When a school can't fill a position, the principal generally loses that salary money from their school's budget; they can’t spend it on something else because the district is counting on it for other priorities, Sinram said.\n\nThe hundreds of vacancies across the district have daily consequences for students. They're often borne quietly, but last spring culminated in two public crises. Both came as a shock, though it was clear the district had been struggling for months with extreme understaffing in each area.\n\nAfter MPS failed to meet a critical audit deadline, leading to the exposure of dysfunctional accounting practices and a suspension of state funding, even school board members said they were surprised to learn how many positions were unfilled in the district's finance office. A state report showed nine of 20 key finance positions were vacant.\n\nAt the same time, the district's Head Start preschool program took a public nosedive after federal officials suspended funding in May, then fully shuttered the program at MPS. The program had been significantly understaffed and repeatedly failed to meet safety standards, including two incidents where children were dropped off by buses and left outside unsupervised until they were discovered by staff.\n\nMPS doesn’t maintain full list of vacancies\n\nThe human resources office at MPS isn’t set up for success — or for measuring success.\n\nOfficials had trouble producing a list of all filled and vacant positions in the district, requested by the Journal Sentinel. Maddaleni said staffed positions are viewable on one software system used in the human resources office, while budgeted positions are tracked in a different software system used by the finance office. Vacancies would be determined by comparing the two, but staff aren't trained on how to use each other's software.\n\nMPS previously considered moving to one software platform, but it didn’t happen, she said.\n\n“I hope at some point we will get to a place where we can try and do that again,” Maddaleni said. “That would be huge for us. We would have a shared understanding of how many positions are filled and should be filled.”\n\nThe HR office is also missing historical data. Maddaleni, who started her job in 2020, said she couldn’t find vacancy data kept by her predecessor.\n\nDuring her time on the job, Maddaleni kept spreadsheets of certain jobs of high interest that her office was supposed to fill. She downloaded weekly snapshots of these lists, which she shared with interim superintendent Eduardo Galvan, she said, and with the Journal Sentinel upon request.\n\nIt’s not a complete picture. The sheets don't include vacancies in central administrative offices. Maddaleni said she separately kept track of job postings for central office positions, though that didn’t include vacancies that department heads weren’t seeking to fill. Unstaffed school-based positions might also be uncounted, she said, if the positions were being filled by certain contractors.\n\nThe HR office is missing other key information, like how long positions remain vacant or how long the hiring process takes. Shortly before her departure, Maddaleni said she was looking into creating a tool to monitor those trends — something consultants recommended as far back as 2019.\n\nMPS also lacks a clear picture of the impact of vacancies.\n\nThough the district has class-size policies that set minimum staffing levels, a spokesman for the district said class sizes aren't tracked district-wide. Class roster data requested and analyzed by the Journal Sentinel show many exceed school board directives.\n\nIt’s also unclear how costly it is for the district to rely on contracts with companies that provide temporary staff for many of its vacant positions, from secretaries and custodians to nurses and teachers. Maddaleni and Sinram said they hadn’t studied the costs of contractors in comparison to the costs of staff.\n\nMaddaleni also said she hadn’t analyzed demographic trends in student populations whose schools have the most vacant positions.\n\nMaddaleni, who took a small pay cut to move to the same post in the Racine Unified School District, declined to say why she made the move. A recent review of MPS operations by MGT of America Consulting, a firm hired by Gov. Tony Evers, recommended MPS conduct an external search for a new human resources leader.\n\nDozens of schools down in special education, art, music, gym\n\nAs of February, MPS had about three unfilled school-based positions for every 440 students, the average school size.\n\nJust 19 of the 134 schools Maddaleni tracked had no vacancies.\n\nThe most at one building, Benjamin Franklin School, was nine vacancies. That's about 17% of the school's budgeted staff, including three core teachers, four paraprofessionals, a secretary, and a children's health assistant — plus a part-time music teacher.\n\nMost of the vacancies were teachers and paraprofessionals, who provide individualized academic and behavioral support. More than half of the teacher vacancies were for special education teachers — a nationwide area of high need.\n\nOnly 87 of the 134 schools were fully staffed for art, music and physical education – three areas of priority for the district, supported by referendum funding. Schools are required to have licensed staff teaching art and music under district policies.\n\nBlack students are twice as likely as white students to attend higher-vacancy schools\n\nPiecing together Maddaleni’s spreadsheet with other datasets, a Journal Sentinel analysis revealed that Black students are about twice as likely as white students to attend schools with vacancy rates above the districtwide median.\n\nAn estimated 53% of Black students are in higher-vacancy schools, along with 52% of Pacific Islander students, 51% of Asian students, 46% of American Indian students, 40% of Hispanic students, and 26% of white students.\n\nVacancy rates were calculated by dividing total vacancies in a school by the projected student population for this school year, which generally matches enrollment from last year. Actual enrollment data for this school year has not yet been certified and published. Demographic data is from the last school year, the most recent available.\n\nStudents from lower-income families are about 1.6 times more likely to attend higher-vacancy schools.\n\nStudents with disabilities are slightly more likely — about 1.1 times — to attend higher-vacancy schools as compared with their non-disabled peers. They’re also more likely to be affected by vacancies, as they depend more on special education teachers who are in the shortest supply.\n\nVacancy rates in the district’s Northwest and Central regions are about 1.7 times higher than the East and Southwest regions. More starkly, vacancy rates in the school board’s District 1 on the far northwest side of the city are more than double the rates in District 8 on the south side.\n\nIn the 53206 ZIP code, home to six of 13 schools that a consultant has recommended the district consider closing, there are more than five vacancies for every 440 students. Schools there serve about 3% of the district's students and carry about 7% of the district's staff vacancies.\n\nCommunity members have argued that a lack of investment in these schools has set them up to fail. Schools in 53206 lack specialty programming. They have lower attendance rates, and — the reason most of them landed on the potential closure list — lower enrollment, with students utilizing about 42% of the building capacity as of 2023, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of MPS data.\n\nTest scores lower at schools with more vacancies\n\nAt a school level, vacancies can disrupt learning at every level.\n\nIn October, teachers at Green Tree Preparatory Academy wrote to school board members about the impacts of short-staffing. Class sizes reached into the 40s, they said. There was a band class that had no instruments and was was taught by rotating substitutes. A Spanish class was taught on Zoom. The four safety assistants were stretched too thin for the severity of fights, which had left a teacher, who tried to intervene, with a twisted knee.\n\nBoard members put the charter school on a closer watch, saying administrators had failed to show how they were fixing problems raised by staff, along with a report showing the school had met just three out of 13 of its academic benchmarks. After an update in February, still frustrated by a lack of measurable progress, board members asked for another update in November with data on academic results.\n\nEach vacancy causes a chain of reactions.\n\nWhen schools are short on teachers, a principal might pull in a paraprofessional to teach a class, which in turn leaves another teacher struggling to manage a classroom without their paraprofessional aide.\n\nSome vacancies are filled by outside agencies.\n\nMPS has contracts with dozens of companies that provide temporary staffing, from a $2 million contract for remote teachers who lead classes via webcam, to a $15 million contract with Goodwill TalentBridge for hundreds of temporary paraprofessionals, food service assistants, secretaries and children’s health assistants. Many schools contract with nonprofits that teach art and music when they can’t find licensed teachers.\n\nMPS also employs hundreds of “permit teachers” who are still working to obtain their licensure. The state Department of Public Instruction issues emergency permits to teachers when school districts aren’t able to find fully licensed teachers. As of last year, MPS had fewer licensed staff per student population than all but 3% of Wisconsin school districts, state data show.\n\nAbout 20% of MPS educators hadn’t obtained full licensure for their jobs in the 2023-24 school year, according to the most recent state data. That's nearly double the estimated national rate: about 11%, according to data compiled by the Learning Policy Institute.\n\nStudents’ test scores appear to correlate with vacancies. In MPS schools where students’ average proficiency rates on language arts standardized tests were below the district average, vacancy rates are about 1.9 times the rates of higher scoring schools, the Journal Sentinel found.\n\nStaff say high-vacancy schools need help\n\nCertain MPS schools have an easier time filling vacancies, especially those that are selective about the students they accept. Five MPS high schools used admission criteria for this school year based largely on academic performance and attendance; collectively their student poverty rate is about 25% less than the district’s rate, and their vacancy rate is less than half the district’s.\n\n“Reagan tends to have lots of applications for their positions,” Maddaleni said, referring to MPS’ most competitive high school with one of the lowest rates of economically disadvantaged students.\n\nIn a segregated city and a stratified school system where families compete for spots at the most coveted schools, students’ needs can vary significantly between buildings. Student populations with higher rates of poverty tend to need more resources at school, such as smaller class sizes and more support staff.\n\nWhen students’ needs aren’t matched with adequate resources, teachers and aides say it can lead to burnout and cause staff to move to more affluent school communities.\n\nOn exit surveys, staff leaving high-vacancy schools were more likely to list working conditions and a lack of support as reasons for leaving, while staff leaving lower-vacancy schools were more likely to list retirement or family reasons, a Journal Sentinel analysis found.\n\nUnlike some school districts, MPS doesn’t use a weighted funding formula to provide more base funding for schools that have more students from lower-income families.\n\nAll schools start with the same base funding per student, but receive more based on certain district initiatives. According to a Journal Sentinel analysis of 2023-24 budget data, the initiatives provided about the same amount of funds per student at schools with higher and lower poverty rates.\n\nSome initiatives — like Montessori, advanced academics and language immersion programs — were concentrated in schools with fewer students from lower-income families. Others — like extra support for arts programs and school office staff — were concentrated in schools with more students from lower-income families.\n\nState and federal grants were the greatest source of support for lower-income students. Two of those grant sources are gone now: pandemic relief funds and Head Start preschool funds. The largest grant source, Title I, which is intended to close achievement gaps for students from lower-income families, is at risk under the Trump administration.\n\nFamilies and staff in schools with higher rates of poverty have long called on MPS to invest its resources more equitably across the district. The incoming superintendent selected by the school board this month has said she would prioritize doing so.\n\nBrenda Cassellius, who previously led Boston Public Schools, used an “opportunity index” there to send more support to schools based on a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, neighborhood safety and residential mobility. Public schools in Chicago and Michigan use a similar model.\n\nAngela Harris, a teacher at Milwaukee Academy of Chinese Language and chair of the Black Educators Caucus, has called on MPS to conduct an equity audit and explore higher funding for higher-needs schools.\n\nLukas Wierer, who taught social studies for eight years at Barack Obama School of Career and Technical Education, has backed Harris' call. After repeatedly asking school board members to provide more resources for schools with higher needs, he lost hope that conditions would change. He transferred last year to Riverside, one of the more competitive MPS schools.\n\n“When you make the job of some teachers much more difficult than others, there’s going to be vacancies in places where the job is harder,” Wierer said.\n\nObama started this fall with two teaching vacancies, according to Maddaleni's tally: an unspecified seventh grade teacher and a special education teacher. In February, there were two more: an English teacher, and a physical education teacher.\n\nWhile Wierer chose to stay within MPS when he left Obama, other teachers have left the district or the education profession altogether.\n\nOn a sunny first day of school last September, Interim Superintendent Eduardo Galvan celebrated starting the school year with the best staffing levels district-wide in four years.\n\nThe picture wasn't as bright this January in Sinram's office. He said the district did lower its teacher vacancy rate this fall — largely by cutting teacher coach positions from its budget and moving those staff to fill vacant classroom positions. That aside, he said the vacancy rates for this school year are about the same as they were for the last school year, and the year before that.\n\nAlready crafting the budget for the next school year, Sinram said he expects the vacancy rates to be about the same again, around 11%.\n\nIt will be a problem for a new human resources leader. Maddaleni, who said she had tried to improve operational and software issues in her office, observed: “Change is hard.”\n\nIn 2023, Maddaleni said her team was working on moving to an electronic exit survey for departing employees so they could track and analyze why so many staff were leaving MPS, which she likened to “a boat that has a hole in it.”\n\nWhen it came time to file her own exit survey, she wrote down her reason for leaving: “Other opportunity.” She used a pen and paper.\n\nHow to work or volunteer at MPS\n\nAs of early February, there were 34 types of jobs open for applications on the MPS Job Openings website.\n\nSeparately, applications to coach MPS sports teams, whether paid or volunteer, can be found on Milwaukee Recreation’s Coaches Corner website.\n\nYou can also contact a school near you about specific volunteer opportunities, or plug into an organization like Forward Scholars, which pairs reading tutors with MPS students.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/baseball/2018/05/22/dominican-driven-perth-amboy-baseball-team-succeeding-field-classroom-during-historic-run/634164002/", "title": "Dominican-driven Perth Amboy baseball team succeeding on field ...", "text": "As one of nearly two dozen players on the Perth Amboy High School baseball team’s roster who were born in the Dominican Republic or are of Dominican descent, Jose Peralta moved to the city three years ago with the hope of a better life.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 senior righthander – who needed to walk more than four miles to play baseball on a diamond in his native Puerto Plata, where families in his neighborhood got their water from a well, according to Perth Amboy head coach Alex Perez – has earned the start on the mound against South Plainfield in Saturday’s Greater Middlesex Conference Tournament final.\n\nPerth Amboy (14-10), which is making its first ever appearance in the league championship game, is assured of finishing with a winning record for the first time since 2012.\n\nThe Panthers posted a 35-73 mark (.324 winning percentage) over the last five seasons. The program’s turnaround can be attributed to several factors, including Perez’s leadership, the city’s investment in youth baseball, dedicated volunteers at the recreation level and an influx of Dominican talent.\n\nStar players such as catcher Darius Diaz (.470) and Chris Brito (.449), who both received full athletic scholarships to Division I schools, form the cornerstone of a team that is brimming with talent at every position, especially on the mound, where Peralta is among Perth Amboy’s greatest success stories.\n\nREAD: Darius Diaz accepts full scholarship offer from Kennesaw State\n\n“The dynamics for him in the Dominican Republic were pretty tough,” Perez said. “His parents came over here to see if he could excel educationally. They made a big sacrifice to get him into this country. As a way to pay back, he wanted to do great in school.”\n\nPeralta spoke little English upon enrolling at Perth Amboy. He currently owns a 3.3 grade-point average and will continue his career as a student-athlete at Kean University. Peralta is one of eight players on the current roster and 26 in five seasons under Perez that will play baseball in college, a testament to Perth Amboy’s commitment to academics through athletics director Neptune Cardona’s implementation of a mandatory study hall (Diaz was recently named the high school's prestigious NJSIAA scholar-athlete recipient).\n\n“It’s amazing how he’s made the transition academically,” Perez said of Peralta, who is an honor roll student. “He’s come a long way. Now, he’s actually getting a lot of confidence in his writing, as well. He’s one of the nicest kids I’ve met in my entire life.”\n\nPeralta and his teammates – approximately half of which Perez said were born or have lived in the Dominican Republic – speak the universal language of baseball. The Panthers are incessantly talking it up on the field or chanting in Spanish from the dugout, with one of the team’s more popular songs loosely translated as “Come on, throw the pitch down the middle, so we can whack it.”\n\nREAD: Diaz's transfer to Perth Amboy gives Panthers dynamic duo\n\nThe city’s love for the game is reflected in the nearly 300 spectators who came out to support the Panthers in last weekend’s conference tournament semifinals, or through those Spanish-speaking fans who create an electric atmosphere during home games, banging tamboras (two sided-drums) or playing guiras (another merengue percussion instrument that creates a maraca sound).\n\n“It’s not just a baseball game, it’s an event,” Rutgers head coach Joe Litterio, who signed Brito to a National Letter of Intent, said of the atmosphere at Rudyk Park’s Roberto Clemente Field, where Perth Amboy plays its home games. “It’s a place where there’s very high energy. Everybody is into the game, and it just seems like everybody is having fun. It’s a great place to play.”\n\nREAD: Perth Amboy reaches GMC tournament final for first time in school history\n\n“There is such a passion in our city for the sport,” Perth Amboy Mayor Wilda Diaz, who was among those in attendance at last weekend’s semifinals, previously told MyCentralJersey.com. “You see it within the Dominican community and also within the Puerto Rican community.”\n\nA Perth Amboy graduate who went on to become a scholarship pitcher at the University of Miami and in the New York Yankees farm system, Perez is of Puerto Rican descent. Under his tutelage, Peralta has developed into a more complete hurler, adding a slider and changeup to a fastball that has topped out at 87 mph. In a state tournament game against Ridge earlier this week, Peralta (5-2, 2.21) had excellent command of all three pitches, resulting in a three-hit shutout.\n\nThe Panthers boast a 2.69 team ERA, an improvement of nearly two points from last season, and are batting .340 as a club, an improvement of 50 points from two years ago.\n\nThe groundwork for Perth Amboy’s current success, according to Ken Ortiz, the city’s recreation director and former Little League president, was laid about a decade ago with the formation of travel baseball teams known as the Caribbean All-Stars.\n\nThrough a generous $25,000 annual contribution from the Eddie and Brenda Trujillo Family Foundation, Ortiz said the city has been able to develop travel teams for four different age groups – ranging from 10-and-under to 16-and-under – affording Perth Amboy players the invaluable opportunity to compete against other programs across the state, such as Toms River, loaded with talent.\n\nREAD: Chris Brito accpets full scholarship from Rutgers University\n\nBrito, who will continue his career at Rutgers University, from which former Perth Amboy star Gaby Rosa graduated as a scholarship player last year, played as a 7-year-old on the city’s 10-and-under travel team. A four-year starter, Brito has since blossomed into one of the state’s best sluggers, recording more than 100 career hits, the most recent of which was a grand slam in Perth Amboy 4-0 state tournament win over Ridge.\n\n“Those guys that played travel ball over that time, it really propelled them a bit more because they saw better competition,” Ortiz said, citing Brito and ace Virgilio Cabrera (6-1, 0.71) as examples. “The difference for us is kids playing more travel ball with coaches with better experience.”\n\nFormer minor league players such as Emmanuel Sena and Rogelio Estevez Nunez, a full-time recreation leader in the city who was a Double A teammate of Michael Jordan’s when the NBA legend spent a year in the Chicago White Sox organization, work with the city’s youth baseball players. Luis Marte, a former Perth Amboy player who is now a police officer in the city, coordinates the travel program. Former high school star Emelio Calderon, an all-state player, conducts pitching clinics in the city. Another former star, Anderson Rosa, who works for the Department of Children Protection and Permanency, also coaches the Caribbean All-Stars.\n\n“We are trying to build a culture here,” Ortiz said of his department working in conjunction with Perez and Cardona. “It’s not only about sports. It’s about academics, family and faith. Baseball is the tool for us to get these kids involved. We have many at-risk kids in Perth Amboy. Many of them come from single-parent homes. Guys like Luis and Anderson – these guys are professionals – and our young boys want to be just like them.”\n\nThirteen years ago, Ortiz worked with the Urban Initiative of Little League Baseball to jump start the city’s Little League program, which was formed in 2002. A quarter of the aspiring Little Leaguers at the time could not afford to pay a $43 registration fee, which the city covered, ensuring no child would be denied an opportunity to play ball. Ortiz received $4,000 worth of equipment from the Urban Initiative, including 80 gloves, 20 catcher’s mitts, 45 aluminum bats, 50 batting helmets, 480 baseballs and 10 complete sets of catcher’s gear. The city appropriated an additional $35,000 to pay for field drainage and lights at its youth baseball facilities. By the time players from that era were juniors and seniors in high school, the Panthers enjoyed a rebirth, posting a 44-11 record during the 2011 and 2012 campaigns, arguably the team's most successful run since the 1961 team won the only sectional title in school history.\n\nPerth Amboy has produced a handful of Major Leaguers including pitcher Jose DeLeon, whose 12-year career (1983-95) was highlighted with a National League-leading 201 strikeouts in 1989, and outfielder William Pennyfeather, who played three seasons (1992-94) with the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nAn arm injury derailed Perez's professional career. Perez was hired to coach at his alma mater in 2014 amid controversy, through no fault of his own, when some felt the position should have been awarded to a veteran assistant, according to The Amboy Guardian. No one at the time criticized Perez, of whom even those supporting the other candidate spoke highly.\n\n“I have a plan to help our kids,” Perez was quoted telling the Board of Education at the time. “I’ve played pro ball. I have a network system and a lot of contacts to help the kids. I’ve done it as a player and as a coach. I will not let you down.”\n\nFive years later, with his team succeeding on the field and in the classroom, Perez has Perth Amboy in a position to make history.\n\n“For us to win on Saturday would be an incredible accomplishment,” said Ortiz, noting the Panthers opened the season with a five-game losing streak and dropped seven of their first 10 outings.\n\n“If you continue working hard, have faith and belief in your coaches and teammates,\" he said, \"good things will come of it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/us/latino-growth-changing-schools-tennessee-reaj/index.html", "title": "Racist rhetoric greets increasing population of Latino students in this ...", "text": "Chattanooga, Tennessee CNN —\n\nSitting in the back of a packed room in the Hamilton County Schools administration complex, Clara fought the urge to leave. She had taken the day off from her factory job to be there but was nervous to see a crowd of people supporting a board member who had referred to Latino students as a burden.\n\nOn that fall afternoon, the mother of three felt like she carried the weight of those parents who wanted to defend their children but couldn’t show up out of fear, or could not leave their workplaces early to attend the school board meeting. Latino families who call Chattanooga, Tennessee, and its surrounding towns home are not invisible, and they don’t want to be a regular target of racist rhetoric and unequal treatment, she told CNN.\n\n“It hurts when someone speaks without really knowing our people and uses ill words to humiliate our children. It hurts because it’s hard to try to understand (English), be there, arrive on time and support my kids at school,” said Clara, 52, whose two younger sons attend schools in the district.\n\n“I’m not leaving because I want a much better future for my children,” she said.\n\nCNN agreed to only use Clara’s first name to protect her identity out of respect for her safety concerns.\n\nIn the months since a Hamilton County Schools school board member suggested the rising number of Latino students who speak little to no English were overwhelming schools, several activists and educators who spoke with CNN said they received anti-immigrant, racist and hateful messages after condemning the remarks.\n\nIn this county near the Tennessee-Georgia border, the growth in the Hispanic or Latino population has outpaced the national average. In the past decade, the number of residents who identified as Hispanic or Latino rose nearly 81% or more than 12,000 people, compared to 23% nationwide, according to US Census data.\n\nA woman jogs past the first mural depicting Latino presence in Chattanooga, painted on the side of Latino grocery store Carniceria Loa #7. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nWhile the county’s more than 366,000 residents largely identify as White and about 7.4% identified as Hispanic or Latino in the 2020 Census, their presence has pushed a community with a dark racial history to face the inequalities that persist and adapt to a new normal that goes beyond the fractured Black-White paradigm that has characterized the South for a long time.\n\nAlthough there are ongoing efforts by the city and school officials to better serve Latino families, the demographic shift has also come with reminders of how heavily divided this region is and the fact that many Latinos live afraid of authorities because of their current or past immigration status.\n\nIn an interview with The Chattanoogan in late August, Rhonda Thurman suggested the rising number of Latino students who speak little to no English were overwhelming schools. Thurman is a long-time board member representing schools with a majority White student population. She is known for her conservative views as well as her stance on books that have been deemed “inappropriate” for children by some or labeled “critical race theory.”\n\n“It is mind-boggling to me the burden it puts on the schools, the teachers and the taxpayers,” Thurman told the newspaper about the number of Latino students.\n\n“Teachers tell me they cannot give the attention they deserve to the English-speaking students because they have to devote so much time to try to help the Hispanic students catch up,” she said according to the newspaper.\n\nDuring the board meeting last month, members briefly discussed resources for Latino students offered by the school district or their interest in new initiatives. That was something that Clara said reinforced her frustration over the lack of support for Latino families and her conviction to overcome the fear that some people of color have toward those with conservative views.\n\n“I’m not afraid of speaking up and share my opinion, it’s where we live. This is the South and this area is absolutely closed (minded) in many aspects,” she said.\n\nClara, center, embraces her sons Daniel and Benjamin. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nA ‘small but very loud minority of extremists’\n\nThe Hamilton County Schools district comprises 76 institutions and serves 45,000 students. About 19% of students, or 8,702, are Hispanic but not all of them have limited English proficiency.\n\nThere are 5,039 students considered English Language Learners currently enrolled, data shows. Diego Trujillo, director of the district’s English as a New Language Program, said Spanish is the top language for ELL but students speak more than 100 different languages, including Arabic, Mandarin, Vietnamese and five Mayan dialects.\n\n“When we think about English learners, there’s this association strictly to folks that are Spanish speaking, and when you look across the district we’re seeing a diversity of language,” Trujillo said.\n\nThe school district declined to comment specifically on Thurman’s comments. Thurman has denied that she specifically called children a burden. She told CNN the number of Latino students were “burdening the system” and the school district was dealing with things it had not faced before.\n\n“Different people say different words and some people just jump on it because I happen to be a conservative and a Christian and some people just don’t like that,” Thurman said.\n\nSemillas, a non-profit group focused on racial and educational justice for the Latino community, has called for Thurman’s resignation and for a new task force to create an action plan that would better support the needs of Latino students and parents. Their online petition has garnered nearly 1,400 signatures.\n\n“While some programming has been developed over the years, Latinx community members have seen little to no proactive action to actually take a moment to meet and listen to the challenges and barriers Latinx and immigrant students and parents face each and every day,” said Mo Rodriguez-Cruz, the group’s co-founder and field director.\n\nA student looks at schoolwork during an English as a New Language class at The Howard High School. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nTaylor Lyons, co-founder of the local parent group Moms for Social Justice, said negativity toward Hispanic students is just the latest in a list of “hot button” issues that have been the focus of conservatives who live in the county. Over the past several years, Lyons said, conservatives have flooded school board meetings to fight mask and Covid-19 vaccine mandates as well as books in school libraries, which made her group subject of threats and accusations. In 2018, Moms for Social Justice launched an initiative to help teachers stock classrooms with books.\n\n“What it tells us is that you have a small but very loud minority of extremists, who are very uncomfortable with the cultural change around them. They’re uncomfortable with the demographic change,” Lyons said.\n\n‘We are becoming one’\n\nIn Chattanooga, the county seat that largely touts itself as progressive, residents are seeing the demographic shift manifest itself in many aspects of their lives.\n\nAt The Howard School, a high school that is the pride of the city’s Black community, numerous photos of its Black alumni decorate the hallways, but most of its current students speak Spanish and are of Guatemalan descent. Most evenings, families can sit on wooden bleachers at amateur soccer matches and cheer as Spanish-language music blasts on speakers. In the city’s Rossville Boulevard, there has been an influx of Guatemalan restaurants and other businesses that proudly display the country’s flag or its national soccer team jersey.\n\nAs the tensions spurred by changes in the student body came to light in recent school board meetings, students and teachers at two schools (Howard and East Side Elementary) in the district opted to keep focusing on creating an inclusive environment around them.\n\nDaisy Hernandez said her friends and classmates at The Howard High School are proud to embrace their background and culture at school. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nWhen Daisy Hernandez walked to her first class at The Howard School three years ago, she heard the chatter of her peers in English, Spanish and Mam, the Mayan language spoken in Guatemala and by her parents. There, the 17-year-old said she doesn’t see or feel the animosity that families like hers often experience while living in the South.\n\n“I see Howard as a school that helps us out in knowing other people. I’ve seen Black students talk to Hispanic students. I think that’s beautiful because we are becoming one,” said Hernandez, who is the high school’s student body president.\n\nThe Howard School is the largest high school in the county and one of 10 schools in the district where Hispanic students surpass the number of students of any other racial or ethnic group. The number of English Language Learners at those schools this year represents 56% of all ELL students in the district.\n\nFor decades, the school was known for predominantly serving Black students, but enrollment data shows that at least half of the student body has been Hispanic in the past five school years.\n\nAt the start of the day, students listen to Assistant Principal Charles Mitchell read announcements in English and then in Spanish. The tradition, which began five years ago and required him to learn a new language, is one of the many ways “we go beyond our means just to include everybody,” Mitchell said.\n\nJose Otero, an English as a New Language teacher who has been at the school for the past four years, said most Hispanic students at Howard are Guatemalan and fall into two major groups. Like Hernandez, some children were born and raised in Chattanooga to immigrant parents, and others recently migrated from Guatemala, El Salvador or Mexico along with their families or by themselves.\n\nJose Otero is among several teachers helping the rising number of Latino students arriving in Hamilton County learn English. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nAll students, Hispanic or Black, have different realities and different experiences, Otero said, and one thing that helps them connect with each other has been sports, especially soccer.\n\nMost of the 40 soccer players at Howard are Guatemalan and the larger school community has taken an interest in the team because they’ve been district champions in recent years, said Otero, who is also the school’s head soccer coach.\n\n“The kids are starting to appreciate each other’s culture and want to be a part of it. I think with time, there’s gonna be more Guatemalan kids playing basketball and baseball and football, and there’s gonna be more Black kids playing soccer,” Otero said.\n\nAbout two miles east of the high school, teacher Amanda Edens and her fifth-grade students at East Side Elementary finished reading “Esperanza Rising” by Pam Muñoz Ryan, a novel about a young girl who flees Mexico and settles in a farm camp in California.\n\nEdens, whose Spanish is limited, said she used the book to teach her students the curriculum while also connecting with them. They are mostly Hispanic, she said, and they enjoyed giggling every time she pronounced the Spanish phrases and words scattered throughout the book.\n\nThe 37-year-old teacher is facing the challenging task of navigating a state law that requires public schools to teach only in English and serving a fast-growing number of students who are not fluent in the language.\n\nBut it’s something that Edens and other teachers in Hamilton County told CNN they embrace and said it’s far from being a burden.\n\nDual-language flags hang in a hallway at East Side Elementary in Chattanooga. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\n“There’s obviously the challenge of how am I going to help a child attain educational success when we don’t speak the same language and I’m giving them complex fifth grade texts in English,” Edens said.\n\n“It’s not necessarily an easy thing, but it is super rewarding when that child starts asking: ‘can I go to the restroom?’ in English, or when they’re speaking Spanish to me and I recognize what they’re saying well enough to communicate back,” she added. “But I’ve never felt burdened by that.”\n\nAt the elementary school, English as a New Language teachers “push in” or join the general education classes and work with small groups to reduce the time the students are away from their classroom. Trujillo, the director of the district’s English as a New Language Program, said that type of language acquisition model is part of the work he hopes to achieve at more schools as the district works to have ENL programs at most campuses. In the past, he said, students were taken to a different campus to get language instruction if their schools did not offer the program or had ENL teachers.\n\nAndrea Bass, one of the ENL teachers at East Side Elementary, said the school staff respects and actively honors their students’ first language and culture. Many of the students are from Guatemala, and their families, who speak Spanish or Mayan dialects, are constantly engaged in their education despite the language barriers, she said.\n\nWhen Edens, Bass and other teachers heard their students might have been referred to as a burden, they signed a letter calling the remarks “offensive to those students, their families, and those of us who teach them.”\n\n“Our students don’t always have a voice and neither do their families,” Bass said. “I felt like it was my duty to speak up for them.”\n\nThat sense of duty comes from seeing how many parents are afraid to speak up or advocate for themselves but nonetheless put a lot of their trust in educators, Bass said.\n\nAndrea Bass and several other teachers in Hamilton County signed a joint letter to show their love and support of Latino students earlier this year. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nEmphasizing ‘inclusion versus assimilation’\n\nThe Latino or Hispanic community in Hamilton County, including Chattanooga, has grown and changed since Clara moved there nearly two decades ago. Yet, the challenges many families face remain the same.\n\nWhen Clara left her hometown in central Mexico, she went from working a desk job that required her to wear high heels and suits to factory jobs in Chattanooga, where sneakers and jeans are the norm. A change that was even more demoralizing, she said, would come on her son’s first day at school when she “realized that I had become illiterate.”\n\n“I could not speak English, I couldn’t have a conversation with my son’s teacher. It was very frustrating,” she said.\n\nNot much has changed for the increasing number of Latino families in the county, many who relocated from the neighboring state of Georgia after a state law that authorized police to investigate the immigration status and arrest undocumented immigrants went into effect in 2011. But city and school officials have launched initiatives in the past year hoping to address their needs.\n\nThe city created the Office of New Americans last year to connect immigrant and refugee communities with city resources, including translation services and helping them with citizenship and naturalization paperwork.\n\n“It’s a way to make sure that we are empowering the people who are coming to Chattanooga and empowering our immigrant community to really be able to flourish,” said Esai Navarro, the office’s director.\n\nNavarro said the key is “emphasizing inclusion versus assimilation.”\n\nThe Howard School launched a \"Newcomer\" program to help students who recently arrived in the United States adjust to the education system. Elijah Nouvelage for CNN\n\nMeanwhile, the school district opened its International Welcome Center to assist international students with enrollment and connect them with support services. The center has helped 224 families since it opened last year.\n\nThe melting pot of races, languages and cultures that Hamilton County and Chattanooga are seeing is everything Hernandez, the high school student, has known ever since she was born.

I can go anywhere just about. So I hit Beaverton, spread it out the last week and a half. And trying to get seen. I don’t know what my end goal is.”\n\nA music lover for all of his life, he briefly tried to play the upright bass in his early 20s, but he didn’t commit himself to it.\n\nJust over a year ago he made up his mind that he had to try again.\n\n“I remember as a kid I wanted to be really great at something,” Byland said.\n\nIn March he started playing the bass guitar in earnest and practiced relentlessly in his garage.\n\nThe former Intel technician rigged up his Chevrolet Venture van so he could practice in parking lots and empty fields to give his neighbors a break from his playing.\n\nWhile practicing in a parking lot in Hillsboro with nobody watching, he jumped up on a wall and continued playing.\n\nPeople noticed, and his gimmick was born.\n\n“I climb up on the wall and start walking back and forth on the wall, people notice me all of a sudden,” he said. “At that moment of being up on the wall, I thought, this is going to make me look really dumb … or really cool. I’m going to be seen either way.”\n\n— Bill Poehler\n\nDetroit and Sisters, two beautiful towns with almost zero eclipse crowds (so far)\n\nCASCADE MOUNTAINS, 10:20 p.m. — Detroit and Sisters figured to be two of the most popular destinations for people visiting for the total solar eclipse this weekend.\n\nThe two towns, both in the path of totality, sit near some of Oregon’s most dramatic scenery.\n\nSparkling blue lakes, Cascade volcanoes and old-growth forest are just a stone’s throw from both.\n\nYet neither have seen anywhere near the projected thousands of eclipse-visitors officials suggested were heading this way.\n\nDespite perfect weather, the number of people in both towns is far smaller than it would be on a normal summer weekend.\n\nIt’s been incredibly frustrating for local business, some of whom put thousands of dollars into special events such as Detroit Lake Eclipse Fest.\n\nSome of the blame could be placed on the wildfires burning near both towns — the Whitewater/French/Little Devil near Detroit and the Milli Fire near Sisters.\n\nYet smoke has been minimal in both locations and the sun has been shining. Both places are ready.\n\nWill anyone show up?\n\n— Zach Urness\n\nTotal eclipse of the corn\n\nAUMSVILLE, 9:50 p.m. – It’s difficult to say if out-of-area eclipse visitors augmented the turnout at Aumsville Corn Festival. But if you were at the end of the line for free, hot-buttered corn, you probably would have thought it did.\n\nFree corn, two ears to the customer, delivered a line that nearly mounted to the outer edge of Porter Boone Park at midday Saturday. The line for corn sales by the bag was not short either.\n\nBut the 49th annual event took place with the same rhythm – and seemingly same numbers – as other corn fest installments of recent years. At 11 a.m. the parade set out from its Cleveland Street staging area, sited in the heart of town, and processed in an oblong circle down the street, arcing over for a full Main Street march before button-hooking back to Cleveland.\n\nResidents poured from abodes and lined the streets, per usual on this day; both sides flanked with all ages, animated by lunges of the younger-set consistently springing to the landing spots of flung candies issued from every float.\n\nThe festival provided at least one person with a bit of a respite; the attendant/clerk at Aumsville Quick Stop, the only gas in town, said she was on her feet, busy and moving all day Thursday as folks filled tanks in anticipation of the weekend mob. As the parade marched by in front of the store Saturday, she actually found enough of a lull to check part of it out.\n\n— Justin Much\n\nVineyards has decrease in visitors, increase in diversity\n\nTURNER, 8:55 p.m. — It's a slow Saturday by Willamette Valley Vineyards standard, but the showing of guests is at least diverse.\n\n\"It's way slower than last Saturday,\" said Eric Ploof, retail operations manager at Willamette Valley Vineyards. \"This is about a third the crowd of last Saturday.\"\n\nWillamette Valley Vineyards sold out of their Monday viewing event, but the tasting room poured two eclipse-themed wines this weekend: a chardonnay and a pinot noir, both 2015s. The pinot is dark and bold, with grapes sourced from five of the Willamette Valley AVAs. A true souvenir, the Solar Eclipse Willamette Valley Pinot Noir is designed to cellar well.\n\nInside the tasting room, both bars bustled with locals and guests alike -- often together. Karl Chrisman of Walnut Creek, California drove to a family farm between Albany and Jefferson on a whim.\n\n\"A couple weeks ago, we decided to come up,\" Chrisman said. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.\"\n\nHis wife, Tamara Chrisman, said the drive was far easier than expected.\n\n\"I was surprised. We thought there'd be more traffic,\" she said. \"Then again, we left early.\"\n\nEd Leamer and Ama Neel of Los Angeles decided to visit family upon reading an article in The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"There was a map of the eclipse with a few cities pointed out, and there was Salem,\" Leamer said. \"My daughter and son-in-law are in Salem.\"\n\nThe two stayed in Portland Friday night before coming to the winery. The rest of the weekend will be spent in Salem.\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nLocals use eclipse as an opportunity to unwind\n\nINDEPENDENCE, 7:55 p.m. — Many visitors are coming to Independence, with elaborate plans for the eclipse weekend. For some residents on the other hand, it's enough just to barbecue and drink beer in the backyard.\n\nJamie Boe, a long-time resident, figured it would be a good way to get together with local friends and those coming from out of town.\n\n\"We're right on the center line,\" he said. \"People will come in, there's a lot of people still live around here, let's have an eclipse/class reunion.\"\n\nHe's all set to watch Monday morning's event from a spot a stone's throw from his grill. But for those traveling farther to see it, he's glad the city prepared.\n\n\"It's not like they're catching us off-guard,\" he said.\n\nMike Danko, now-retired city planner for Independence and in attendance at the barbecue, cited the annual July 4 Western Days festival as good practice. That event usually draws 20,000-25,000 attendees to Independence, he said, and may have prepared officials for the big eclipse-weekend crowds.\n\n\"It's a major undertaking and a major effort for the city,\" he said. \"Also it's really time-consuming. Small cities are typically understaffed and that's certainly true for Independence.\"\n\nThe next 48 hours will put the planning to the test as visitors continue to trickle into the waterfront camping area before Monday's eclipse.\n\n— Cooper Green\n\nMasses have yet to arrive in Newport\n\nNEWPORT, 7:35 p.m. — The masses for the first sighting of the Great American total solar eclipse have yet to appear on the coast.\n\nThe big event begins Monday at 10:16 a.m., visible first here, and concluding 90 minutes later across the country in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nOfficials were bracing for a huge influx of pilgrims to this coastal city, but as of Saturday, the streets in the normally busy waterfront area were about average for a summer day.\n\n“I thought there would be a lot more people here, especially on a weekend,” said Jon Moyles, who drove from Spokane to see the eclipse from the beginning.\n\nNewport is in the “Path of Totality,” the many state spread where folks will get to see the total eclipse, when the moon slips behind the sun briefly and morning goes from light to dark and back to light again.\n\nFrom Oregon, the total eclipse will move to Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n\nSome 1 million people are expected to visit Oregon to see the eclipse, but most are going inland, to places like Madras and the Salem area, because the skies are more likely to be clear, and thus, they will have a better chance at seeing the eclipse in it’s totality.\n\nAccording to weather.com, the forecast for Monday at 10 a.m. in Newport is partly cloudy, and 57 degrees, compared to sunny and 92 degrees in Madras.\n\nKenny Adair, who drove to Newport from nearby Portland, Oregon, didn’t mind the lack of crowds.\n\nHe bought himself six souvenir eclipse hats from the “Made in Oregon” store by the waterfront, and was getting ready to distribute them to his family members.\n\n“I figure at some point there will be mass crowds and bumper to bumper traffic, but I hope it doesn’t occur,” says Adair.\n\n— Jefferson Graham\n\nCrowds grow downtown\n\nSALEM, 6:15 p.m. — When GovCup owner Alyssa Delgado drove in to work Saturday morning, she said downtown Salem was \"a ghost town.\"\n\n\"It felt a little eerie,\" Delgado said, standing outside her coffee shop. \"I think everybody just stayed home.\"\n\nFriday night, the bar hosted a band with a larger-than-normal crowd, but Delgado said the audience seemed to consist of locals.\n\nAs Saturday progressed, however, Delgado said the crowds picked up.\n\n\"It's nuts,\" Delgado said. \"We've been getting more and more people who are clearly not local, asking questions about the area... I think it started later than everyone expected.\"\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nAstronomy buff tries to get family interested\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS, 6 p.m. — Chasing the eclipse is a family affair for many camping at Solartown, including the Chengs from Seattle.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\n“I’m the family astronomy buff,” Sam Cheng said. “I drag my family around hoping they’ll catch the bug.”\n\nCheng was wrestling with his tent in the wind with assistance from his wife, Lima, and their three children, ages 11, 9 and 6.\n\nThey traveled here in their minivan and this is only the second time they have camped as a family. The first time was for a meteor shower closer to home in Washington state.\n\nLima, who is from India, isn’t likely to catch the bug.\n\n“The kids, maybe,” she said. “But this is not my thing. Where I come from, if you sleep outside it’s because you don’t have a home. No one I grew up with chose to do this. My husband was a Boy Scout, but I don’t have any nostalgia for this.”\n\nIsabella, their oldest daughter, may have potential. At the very least, she knows what to expect come Monday. When asked if she had ever seen an eclipse before, she had this to say: “I’ve seen one on YouTube.”\n\n— Capi Lynn\n\nWine Country Eclipse still has room\n\nRICKREALL, 5:30 p.m. — Things are still a little quiet at the Polk County Fairgrounds, site of Wine Country Eclipse, a three-day music and wine festival celebrating the event.\n\nHere at the fairgrounds, there is still room for around 50 tents and over 100 RVs, according to Elaine Cuyler, organizer and author of children's book The Big Eclipse.\n\n\"In reality, you can still come down here and find a place to camp and hang out,\" she said. \"If you can get here a day ahead of time, a couple days ahead of time, you don't have to deal with traffic issues.\"\n\nTed Sadlowski drove up to the Polk County Fairgrounds from Long Beach, California, to see friends, as well as the eclipse. He saw a partial eclipse in Los Angeles in the 1990s.\n\n\"It gets a very ethereal tone to it. It's hard to explain. You can tell things aren't normal,\" he said.\n\nSadlowski said he expects many more people to show up Sunday, but that he hopes things stay relatively calm.\n\n\"I hope everybody keeps a measure of sanity. It's a celestial event and we should enjoy it for what it is,\" he said.\n\nThe event at the fairgrounds supports Solar Oregon, a nonprofit which advocates renewable energy, and features Eola Vineyards wine. There will also be lectures from local astronomers and a NASA scientist, and local Etsy vendors selling various goods. Bookings can be made online at winecountryeclipse.com.\n\n— Cooper Green\n\nArtist paints eclipse mural, but will skip viewing\n\nCORVALLIS, 5:20 p.m. — It’s difficult to tell if Johnny Beaver is serious or joking when he talks about his plan for Monday’s solar eclipse.\n\nBeaver’s plan, so he says, is to lock himself inside his closet or some other windowless location and do everything he can to not look up at the sky. He says he will livestream himself on Instagram doing nothing — or perhaps watching Netflix — and even made a Facebook event inviting other people to watch him see nothing historic.\n\n“I can either watch it, or be the one person who didn’t, and somehow that seems more valuable,” Beaver said.\n\nHe understands if people see it as a “jerk, hipster thing to do,” but “there’s something to missing out on things,” he says.\n\nIronically, or perhaps not, Beaver was picked to paint a mural in a room at the Fairbanks Gallery at Oregon State University this weekend as a part of the “Totality” solar eclipse art exhibit. It’s the first public mural the recent OSU graduate has painted and it will take him more than 25 hours of work over three days.\n\nHis piece consists of a dozen misshapen, black but somehow translucent individuals, filling three walls, all turned or eyes pointed toward the fourth wall where the solar eclipse has reached totality.\n\nEach figure has a unique characteristic: one has a head growing from one of its feet, another two are conjoined twins (or perhaps neighbors?), and a third has extraordinarily long fingers.\n\nIn short, they are weirdos.\n\nHe wants people to step into the room and look toward the eclipse wall, and then become another member of the group of people staring at the celestial event, as they will on Monday morning.\n\nBeaver wants people to see what he sees, which is that, regardless of a person’s background or beliefs, they all are infatuated with the solar eclipse. Perhaps when they stand among a group of painted weirdos, they will realize they are all weirdos, too, he said.\n\n“Everybody is obsessed with this damn eclipse,” Beaver said.\n\nEclipse experts on hand for baseball fans\n\nKEIZER, 4:15 p.m. — NASA representative Molly Wasser was at Volcanoes Stadium early Saturday afternoon equipped with a globe and pictures depicting what a total solar eclipse will look like to help fans understand what they’ll be witnessing Monday.\n\nThe game between the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes and Hillsboro Hops will be delayed Monday after the first inning, marking the first eclipse delay in baseball history. Totality is scheduled to occur at 10:17 a.m. and last 1 minute, 43 seconds at the ballpark.\n\n“I’ve never seen a total eclipse before. I’ve been waiting for this for ages,” said Wasser, 29, who is an Education and Outreach Specialist at NASA Goodard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nWasser said temperatures will drop between 10 and 30 degrees as totality approaches, and “it will take a little over an hour to reach totality.”\n\n“The entire time that the moon is going in front of the sun during the partial eclipse, it will slowly be getting darker,” Wasser said. “Shadows will be getting sharper and it will slowly be getting cooler.”\n\nAnd at totality “it will be as dark as a moonlit night,” Wasser said.\n\nWasser will speak on the field Monday at approximately 8 a.m.\n\nBrady Johnson, a freshman at McKay High School, was at Volcanoes Stadium on Saturday and has a ticket for Monday’s game.\n\n“It’s fun to be able to watch the eclipse at a baseball stadium,” Johnston said. “I’m not nervous at all.”\n\n— Gary Horowitz\n\nMuch to browse at Silverton arts festival\n\nSilverton 4 p.m. – Silverton Fine Arts Festival proved to be a popular draw Saturday, and some speculate that eclipse visitors may be providing a significant boost in its attendance.\n\nNobody knows that better than the greeters at the front gate to Coolidge-McClaine Park, who said they had notched more than 1,000 visitors by early afternoon, and there was another entrance to the east by the footbridge over Silver Creek also notching entries.\n\nShade from the park’s venerable firs and scores of artist booths furnished an amiable mix for mingling on a sunny day, as Highwater Johnny enriched the background with a perfect blend of classic rock oldies: “Solitary Man,” “Lodi,” “The Weight.”\n\nA little bit of congestion downtown saw traffic trickling slowly down Water Street near Oak and Main streets. But several shuttle stops minimized what could have been multiplicatively worse traffic headaches given the number of visitors in town.\n\n— Justin Much\n\nMellow vibes abound in Independence\n\nINDEPENDENCE, 3:10 p.m. — If you’re looking for a laid back solar eclipse festival experience, head out to Independence today. As of this afternoon, it wasn’t overly crowded, there was plenty of parking and the library still had eclipse glasses available.\n\nDebbie Mattison of Dundee was at the Indy Goes Dark Eclipse Festival with her family Saturday afternoon, with a paintbrush in hand. She found a shady spot along the river to set up her canvas and painting supplies.\n\n“I have a cousin who is an astronomy buff and he wanted to see 100 percent (be in the path of totality), so we’re down here in Independence,” Mattison said. “It’s a beautiful day and the weather is perfect.”\n\nMattison said she didn’t have any expectations in terms of crowds and traffic.\n\n“I figured that the total chaos was probably exaggerated,” she said. “At least, as of today. We have a hotel downtown so we’re just walking everywhere so were’ not in traffic. We’ll see what it’s like Monday at noon.”\n\nCourtney Williams, Event Coordinator for the City of Independence, said they planned for about 15,000 to 20,000 people in terms of amenities and resources.\n\n“That’s what we’re thinking but it’s really up in the air,” Williams said. “I’m hoping for less, like 5,000 to 10,000 to make it more manageable. But it’s great for the city. It’s great for the community. It’s pretty awesome to have all these people here in Independence celebrating the eclipse.”\n\nAll of the RV and tent and car camping spots are sold out, she said. Not everyone has arrived yet. Williams said a lot of people are coming in on Sunday and that they expect to have at least 1,000 people camping.\n\n“I think people are going to mill in all throughout the weekend,” she said. “I don’t think it will be too stressful. I think Monday will be different, of course, when everyone leaves at the same.”\n\n–– Danielle Peterson\n\nTraffic as usual in Newport\n\nNewport, 2:30 p.m. — Traffic in Newport is normal for a summer Saturday as visitors start to trickle in for waterside views of the Great American total solar eclipse on Monday morning. Phil Wallace, of Fairplay, South Carolina, arrived in Newport on Friday in his motor home. Even though his house in South Carolina is in the path of totality, Wallace wanted to be among the first in the country to see the eclipse.\n\n— Anna Read\n\nSaturday rush that never was\n\nSALEM, 2:15 p.m. — Willamette Valley Pie Company prepared for big crowds Saturday. After a few hours, four employees were sent home.\n\n\"We think that (the rush) hasn't really started yet,\" said May Dettwyler, supervisor at Willamette Valley Pie Company. \"The farmers next door have opened themselves up for the viewing, so we'll open at 6:30 a.m. on Monday.\"\n\nThe pie shop and store sold $4 blackberry eclipse pies and eclipse glasses for $2.\n\n\"We're a little bit off the radar so we don't know what to expect,\" Dettwyler said. \"But we're ready.\"\n\n— Brooke Jackson-Glidden\n\nJeweler creates for the occasion\n\nCORVALLIS 1:30 p.m. — Behind a small table at the crowded Saturday morning Corvallis Farmers’ Market, Rob Lichty sells bright copper pendants with a dark center, evoking the event thousands of people are traveling into the city to witness.\n\nLichty traveled up from Morrow Bay, California, to meet some friends for the solar eclipse, and he and his wife, Michelle, decided it would be a good idea to make pendants special for the occasion.\n\nAfter a few weeks of thinking and designing, Lichty put the copper piece together – a couple inches in diameter, with an engraved copper base underneath a dark, enameled copper center. The engraving on the copper is reminiscent of sun rays, or the sun’s corona.\n\nHe has been making pendants for about a year, and “Pendants for Peace” is currently an offshoot of his engineering business. Someday Lichty hopes to turn the pendants into a nonprofit and a working museum for his machines.\n\nThe machines are the reason Lichty got into making jewelry. For his work, he only uses very old machines, which he has put together over 20 years of collecting. One of his prized pieces is an 1840 British Holtzapffel turning lathe.\n\nLichty describes the machines as assisting in the process, but he still does the work by hand. It took him about four hours to create each of the one dozen unique solar eclipse pendants last week.\n\nPreparing to camp out with friends and making pendants is far more preparation than Rob and Michelle had before the last total solar eclipse they witnessed.\n\nThat one was in Prague in 1999, and they didn’t even know it was coming. Suddenly, the sky just started turning dark.\n\n“We experienced four seasons in about 20 minutes,” Lichty said. “It’s something that’s stuck in our minds.”\n\nThis time they’ve brought their two kids along — Aleric, 8, and Kalila, 5 — who designed some eclipse artwork of their own: small pillows with felt designs of people standing below the sun at totality.\n\n— Connor Radnovich\n\nSearch Detroit Lake for special prize-winning eclipse rocks\n\nDETROIT, 1 p.m. — The idea started in 2015, one of the worst years for businesses in Detroit.\n\nThat was the year a historic drought brought Detroit Lake to its lowest summertime level in history. It meant fewer boats on the water, and fewer people, in a town that depends on summer tourism.\n\nTo get people to focus beyond the lake, and explore the beauty surrounding town, Jamie Dobrowolski decided to create a scavenger hunt for the social media age, all centered on Detroit’s rocks.\n\nThe daughter of the owners of Mountain High Grocery, Dobrowolski created special “Detroit Rocks” and began hiding them in the surrounding trails, mountains and wild spaces. After hiding each rock, she posts a picture and maybe a hint of its location on the Detroit Lake Facebook page.\n\nAnybody who finds one can follow a website and code on the rocks and enter to win prizes. And, of course, they get to keep the rocks.\n\n“The idea was to entice people to explore the trails, to go mushrooming or just visit areas they might not otherwise have known about,” she said.\n\nDobrowolski created a special collection of Detroit Rocks for the eclipse — 20 in total. They have an eclipse logo on them and anyone who finds one can register for a special eclipse-themed prize package. And, of course, they can keep the rock.\n\n— Statesman Journal outdoors reporter Zach Urnesshid one of the Detroit Rocks along the North Santiam River, just off Highway 22, near his favorite rapid to kayak in the spring and winter.\n\nNorth Santiam State Park offers mellow spot to view eclipse\n\nNORTH SANTIAM STATE PARK, 11:15 a.m. — Want to get out of Salem and enjoy a mellow spot to watch the eclipse on Monday?\n\nConsider North Santiam State Park, along Highway 22 east of the capital.\n\nThe small state park has an astronomer on hand, Theresa Summer, from San Francisco, who will be giving talks and offering information leading up to and during the eclipse.\n\nThere are a few small meadows to watch the eclipse at the state park, and wonderful spots along the river to enjoy the area’s relaxed atmosphere.\n\nSummer has a fun presentation showing how the earth, moon and sun all line up during an eclipse. She’ll also demonstrate why it’s so rare to have an eclipse, on land, in populated areas.\n\n“This really is the people’s eclipse,” she said. “For most eclipses, you have to pay lots of money and fly to some island in the ocean. That’s what makes this so exciting.”\n\n— Zach Urness\n\nTest your eclipse knowledge\n\nSALEM, 11:20 a.m. — Are you an eclipse wiz? Do you know all there is to know about the celestial phenomenon? Or maybe you want to boost your celestial know-how? Either way, you can check out the Solar Eclipse Trivia Quiz created in part by Oregon Connections Academy, an online, public charter school. Ten questions will help you better understand the basics of the upcoming Great American Solar Eclipse, or perhaps reassure you are the greatest scientist since Einstein.

Another section across Dogwood Lane NW is almost full.\n\nSolartown has 5,000 RV and tent sites that stretch across two fields that grow Kentucky Bluegrass Seed that was planted last year. Before that, the crop was carrots.\n\nSewage waste trucks were out early this morning emptying porta potties, and volunteer crews from the Madras FFA program were emptying trash at each handwashing station.

A rumor had floated earlier that Salem bridges were closing down.\n\nIt’s been quiet Saturday morning save the bridge caller, but Kools says the crew got about 16 calls yesterday, mostly about camping in the parks, parking and gas.\n\nAsked if more calls are expected, Kools says yes, especially tonight and throughout tomorrow.\n\nShe hopes that during the eclipse itself, it’ll be quiet.\n\n— Jonathan Bach\n\nWho do you call?

It’s burning largely in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.\n\nThe third fire, the Little Devil Fire, located about three miles from the Breitenbush Community, grew to 103 acres. It hasn’t made any progress toward Breitenbush and solid containment lines are in place.\n\n—Zach Urness\n\nAccidental eclipse vacation\n\nSALEM, 8:45 a.m. — Around 1 million people are expected to travel into Oregon for the solar eclipse, and Andrea Konow and her family from Oreland, Pennsylvania, are among them.\n\nIn February, Konow began looking for rentals in the Portland area for a family trip this week, and discovered rooms far more expensive than she expected.\n\nAfter some research, she found out about the solar eclipse.\n\n“Oh my gosh, the eclipse is happening and it’s going right through Lincoln City,” Konow recalls thinking.\n\nKonow, her partner and two teenage daughters are going to spend a little longer in Oregon than had the eclipse not coincided with their original plans. They will also be staying in a beach house in Lincoln City instead of Portland, planning to see the eclipse from on beach (weather permitting).\n\nDuring their five-day visit, Konow said they’ll be seeing the town and hiking about the region. Konow went to school at Oregon State University, but never got to know the Lincoln City area well.\n\nShe also decided to turn away from a hotel room, instead renting a house through Vacasa, a Portland based vacation rental company. Vacasa says only 22 of their 1,407 Oregon homes were available just days before the eclipse.\n\n— Connor Radnovich\n\nYes, there are showers in Solartown\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS 8:20 a.m. — Thank you, OK’s Cascade Company. My shower worries have been eased.\n\nThe Snohomish, Washington, company is providing a mobile shower at Solartown, where I’m camping for eclipse weekend.\n\nThe 16-head mobile shower is housed in a 48-foot trailer, with eight shower stalls for women and eight for men. The unit also comes equipped with eight sink basins.\n\nAccording to the company’s website, the unit is fully capable of supporting over 100 people per hour of operation. Signs posted say it will be open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nI was the only person in there this morning, but I imagine the lines will be long as it gets further into the weekend and the 5,000-plus campsites fill up.\n\nThere’s also a smaller trailer with eight individual shower stalls that look to be more private.

Other companies, including Amazon, also issued recalls after counterfeit glasses ended up in the hands of consumers.\n\nThe company issued a voluntary recall on their Facebook page late Sunday.\n\n\"If you received a pair of these glasses, DO NOT USE THEM TO VIEW THE ECLIPSE,\" the post stated.\n\nThe company will take glasses back at the location originally obtained for a free drink.\n\nORIGINAL POST: CORVALLIS, 8:00 a.m. — Don't have a pair of eclipse glasses yet?

Visitors are expected to pour into the state over the next 48 hours, which may cause traffic gridlock.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Transportation offers some tips to prepare for traffic:\n\n- As traffic volumes increase, ODOT may restrict some left lane turns to and from highways in order to keep traffic moving. Individual cities and counties may dothe same on streets and roads, especially in heavily populated areas.\n\n- Make sure to take care of anyerrands (i.e. grocery shopping, refueling, last minute eclipse glasses-shopping, etc.) before Monday, Aug. 21.\n\n- Carpool with friends and family in one car, if possible.\n\n-Arive to your destination early and leave later in the day.

Just $40 to watch from there or $80 to camp, and we're told there are still plenty of spaces available.\n\nIn the small city of Corvallis, home to OSU, eclipse fever was on display at local businesses. The popular McMenamins on Monroe offered eclipse themed drinks, you could buy Eclipse T-shirts at a local printing store, and those solar glasses that have been sold out elsewhere nationally, are still in supply in Corvallis.\n\nA local convenience store is giving them away for free (with purchases of over $40) or $1.99 a pair.\n\nAnd if glasses aren't your thing, there's a popular longtime item pulled from the back to impulse territory--Eclipse gum, the brand that's been around since 1999.\n\n— Jefferson Graham\n\nFamily from Canada drives several days to witness eclipse\n\nSALEM — Jim Wright drove with his wife, two young daughters and mother-in-law nearly 14 hours to Rockaway Beach from Alberta, Canada, for the solar eclipse.\n\nWright decided to take at least two days for the drive, having never been through that part of the country before. His goal was to make the entire trip an experience, particularly for his kids, instead of just going for the eclipse.\n\n“There’s always stuff to see,” he said. “Flying, you’re kind of in then you’re out.”\n\nHe and his family will be traveling for about 10 days, at least half of that spent in Oregon. The way he put it, they could either go to Idaho for totality, or to the Oregon coast, and the choice was pretty clear.\n\nIt took him several weeks of search more than six months ago to find a place to stay.\n\nWright said he is most looking forward to interacting with Oregonians and visitors from out of state there for the eclipse.\n\nUp to 1 million people are expected to visit Oregon for the Great American Eclipse from all across the country and internationally.\n\nVacasa, the Portland based vacation rental company Wright used, reported that only 22 of their 1,407 Oregon homes were available just days before the eclipse.\n\n— Connor Radnovich\n\nParamedics on the ready in Solartown\n\nSOLARTOWN, MADRAS — If residents of Solartown need medical assistance during eclipse weekend, they appear to be in good hands.\n\nAdventure Medics was on scene quickly Friday afternoon to assist an 82-year-old man who was experiencing “possible cardiac issues.”\n\nThe paramedic arrived in a Polaris UTV, transported him to the Mobile Medical Base near the center of Solartown, then waited for an ambulance from Jefferson County Emergency Medical Services, which arrived within just a couple minutes.\n\nAdventure Medics is based in Bend, but has set up a command center here to serve eclipse chasers.\n\nAccording to its website, Adventure Medics was founded by Matt Sabelman because he wanted to combine two passions in his life: emergency medical services and a lifestyle filled with adventure.

Built by Northrop Grumman, the bomber was named in honor of the “courageous spirit” of airmen who carried out the surprise World War II Doolittle Raid.\n\nThe sixth-generation aircraft is expected to help the Air Force “penetrate the toughest defenses for precision strikes anywhere in the world,” Northrop Grumman’s press release said. Six bombers are currently in “various stages of final assembly” in California, according to the release.\n\nThe event on Friday was even more significant given that it marked the first time in more than 30 years a new US bomber has been publicly unveiled since the B-2 Spirit was presented in 1988. While the US originally planned to have a fleet of 132 B-2s, just 21 were ultimately purchased.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin touted the newest US stealth bomber in a speech Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. He called the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider a “major advance for American deterrence” and said it would be the backbone of the US bomber fleet in the future.\n\nAustin, who attended the unveiling of the B-21 in Palmdale, said Saturday that the years ahead would be a “decisive decade” as the US faces competition from China and the threat of Russia. The release of the new bomber comes amid heightened tensions between the US and both China and Russia. Just days ago, the Pentagon released its annual report on China, which said the country has doubled its number of nuclear warheads in a fraction of the time the US expected it to.\n\nBy 2035, the report said, China could have roughly 1,500 nuclear warheads – an “accelerated expansion” of its stockpile, a senior defense official told CNN.\n\nThe next years, Austin said Saturday, “will determine whether our children and grandchildren inherit an open world of rules and rights – or face emboldened autocrats who seek to dominate by force and fear.”\n\nThe B-21 was designed with that competition in mind. Northrop Grumman’s rundown of the new bomber’s abilities said that while adversaries “continue to invest in and develop advanced weapons,” the B-21 will allow the US to penetrate enemy air defense and hit targets “anywhere in the world.”\n\n“America’s defense will always be rooted in deterring conflict. So, we are again making it plain to any potential foe: the risk and the cost of aggression far outweigh any conceivable gains,” Austin said at the Friday unveiling. “This is deterrence the American way.”\n\nWhile Friday marked the “first time the world’s first sixth-generation aircraft (was) seen by the public,” Northrop Grumman said, airmen and aircraft enthusiasts alike will have to wait until next year to actually see one in the air.\n\nThe first B-21 flight is expected to happen in 2023, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said, though she emphasized that the timing of the first flight “will be data and event, not date, driven.”\n\nThe Air Force previously said that the new nuclear-capable stealth bomber, which has the ability to carry both nuclear and conventional weapons and which will fall under the Air Force’s Global Strike Command, will be “the backbone of the future Air Force bomber force,” designed in a way that is ripe for future modernization efforts.\n\nThe service named Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, as the home of the B-21 and home to the aircraft’s training program. Each aircraft was anticipated to cost $550 million when the price was set in 2010; after adjusting for inflation this year, Stefanek said, the cost of each aircraft, including training materials, support equipment and other components of the bomber, is $692 million. The Air Force plans to purchase at least 100 of the stealth bombers.\n\n“Even the most sophisticated air defense systems will struggle to detect the B-21 in the sky,” Austin said at the unveiling.\n\nThe B-21 has been built with long-term sustainability and maintainability in mind, Northrop Grumman said in the release. It has also been designed to be rapidly upgraded when future threats demand it – a process that can often be slowed down by bureaucratic red tape and delayed timelines when it comes to older military aircraft and vehicles.\n\nThe bomber won’t undergo “block upgrades,” according to Northrop Grumman, which is a method of periodically upgrading parts of a system. Instead, the company said new “technology, capabilities and weapons will be seamlessly incorporated” through software upgrades.\n\n“This will ensure the B-21 Raider can continuously meet the evolving threat head on for decades to come,” the company said.\n\nHonoring the past\n\nThe name “Raider” was submitted by airmen with the 337th Test and Evaluation Squadron out of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and beat out more than 2,000 other suggestions. It refers to the April 1942 Doolittle Raid, during which 80 airmen flew a retaliatory mission to bomb Japan just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nLed by then-Lt. Col. James “Jimmy” Doolittle, the airmen flew roughly 650 miles to Japan, bombing military installations, storage facilities and factories, according to the Air Force. But because of limited fuel, they knew it was unlikely they’d make it back to safety as planned.\n\nInstead, the pilots and crew “ditched at sea, bailed out, or crash-landed in China,” according to the National Museum of the US Air Force, many reaching safety with the help of Chinese citizens. According to the museum, as many as a quarter of a million Chinese citizens were later executed by the Japanese as punishment for assisting the Americans.\n\nFormer Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James announced the new bomber’s name in 2016 alongside one of the airmen who flew on that World War II mission, retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, who died in 2019.\n\n“We wanted [to] ensure the aircraft had a strong name airmen could take pride in, especially those who will have the opportunity to fly and maintain the B-21,” Lt. Col. Jaime Hernandez, commander of the 337th, said in 2016. “We also wanted to take an element of our history into account, and the story of the Doolittle Raiders embodies just that.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Haley Britzky Ellie Kaufman Oren Liebermann", "Haley Britzky", "Ellie Kaufman", "Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/omarosa-trump-ethics-case-ruling", "title": "Omarosa Manigault Newman ordered to pay more than $60K in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA federal judge has ruled against former Trump administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman and ordered her to pay more than $60,000, in a lawsuit the Justice Department brought against her after then-President Donald Trump fired his former apprentice.\n\nThe case found that Manigault Newman hadn’t complied with federal ethics requirements that public officials file financial disclosures when they leave a government job.\n\nThough it revolved around a compliance matter, over the last few years, Manigault Newman’s departure and litigation spun into a juicy drama between the powers of the Trump White House and a combatant, well-known personality once in its fold.\n\nShe had been director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison in Trump’s White House. But Trump fired her in December 2017, less than a year after he took office as president. (Trump had fired her previously, on the first season of “The Apprentice.”)\n\nSince then, Manigault Newman has been publicly critical of Trump, calling him a racist, releasing tapes she recorded in his administration and writing a book about him titled “Unhinged.”\n\nOn Twitter on Tuesday, following the ruling, Manigault Newman again criticized Trump.\n\n“The question remains… are there two systems of justice in this country. One that allows those who violate the Hatch Act and Emoluments Clause a slap on wrist and the other that orders an unprecedented fine (highest in history) for an alleged unintentional failing to file a form?” she wrote.\n\nAfter Manigault Newman left the White House, administration attorneys reminded her repeatedly that she hadn’t filed her final financial disclosure. Manigault Newman did not make the filings.\n\nShe claimed, according to the court filings, that the White House had her last day wrong, and she told the court that the Trump administration held hostage boxes of her belongings and other files that she needed.\n\nStill, the judge, Richard Leon of the DC District Court, found Manigault-Newman liable for a $61,585 civil penalty and ordered her to pay the fee to the US Treasury within a month. That amount is the maximum $50,000 penalty for the violation, plus inflation.\n\n“Manigault Newman willfully violated the [Ethics in Government Act],” Leon wrote in a 15-page opinion on Tuesday. The judge noted Manigault Newman was “well aware of her obligation” to make her final disclosures and had “received countless reminders.”\n\n“This conduct establishes a willful violation,” the judge added.\n\nLeon also decided Manigault Newman, one of the most well-known faces from Trump’s era as a reality TV honcho who has kept a public persona since her breakout 18 years ago, would have ample funds to make the payment.\n\nShe made a salary of $179,700 in her White House post and is a partial beneficiary of a million-dollar trust, the judge said.\n\nHer attorney, John Phillips, told CNN on Tuesday that his client may appeal and criticized the Biden administration for continuing to pursue the case. “They played games with the system,” Phillips said, adding that now-Attorney General Merrick Garland “is supposed to be returning stability and reason back to government. This is the opposite of that.”", "authors": ["Katelyn Polantz"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/us/buffalo-uss-the-sullivans-sinking/index.html", "title": "USS The Sullivans: WWII-era ship tilting into Lake Erie in Buffalo ...", "text": "1.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/americas/canada-trucker-protests-covid-wednesday", "title": "Judge temporarily bans protesters against Canadian Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTensions stemming from protests spearheaded by Canadian truck drivers over the country’s Covid-19 mandates have been simmering in recent weeks, so much so that traffic at key US transit points has ground to a stop and a judge has temporarily banned demonstrators in the nation’s capital from using horns.\n\nFor nearly two weeks, Canadian truckers have been protesting a new rule that requires them to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or face a two-week quarantine in their homes after they return across the US-Canadian border. Others have joined to rally against mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions on gatherings and other Covid-19 preventative efforts in the country.\n\nDemonstrations have popped up across Canada, including at the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit and is the busiest international crossing in North America. Idling trucks and vehicles impeded access to the bridge for a third day Wednesday, snarling traffic on both sides of the border.\n\n“When the border crossing of this magnitude – almost a third of all traffic between our two countries crosses here – and when it closes down, it has an immediate and material impact on the economies of our both nations,” Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN’s Don Lemon on Tuesday night.\n\nSome protesters have been loud – so annoyingly loud that a lawsuit is demanding an end to the deafening honking unleashed by the truckers in downtown Ottawa, Canada’s capital, where residents have endured the near-constant noise in their homes.\n\nZexi Li, who lives within five blocks of protests at Parliament Hill, sued to demand an end to the beeping. Sound levels from the air and train horns are “dangerous and cause permanent damage to the human ear” and cause “significant mental distress, suffering and torment,” the lawsuit filed by the 21-year-old says.\n\nOntario Superior Court Justice Hugh McLean on Monday issued a 10-day injunction that prevents demonstrating truckers on downtown Ottawa streets from using air or train horns. A hearing is set for next Wednesday.\n\nMayor Jim Watson described the constant honking of large trucks as “tantamount to psychological warfare” and wrote in letters to federal and provincial officials earlier this week that, “People are living in fear and are terrified.”\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Canadian-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge was still shut down, Michigan officials tweeted. US-bound traffic was flowing for both commercial and passenger traffic, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAccess to the bridge from the Canadian side could be tricky, however. Owing in part to protests on that side, traffic was heavy and some roads were blocked. One access route in particular was still open, Windsor police Constable Talya Natyshak said.\n\nAbout 100 protesters were in the area of the bridge in Windsor as of 9 a.m. ET Wednesday, Natyshak said.\n\nCanadian-bound and US-bound lanes were open to passenger and some commercial traffic at an alternative, the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, which has height restrictions, according to Canadian and US border websites.\n\nAnother alternative, the Blue Water Bridge connecting Port Huron and Sarnia about a 60-mile drive northeast of Detroit, was open to traffic from both sides. While little wait was reported for US-bound traffic and Canada-bound passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles headed to Canada were enduring delays of more than four hours Wednesday morning, according to Canada’s website for wait times.\n\nThe truckers’ vaccine rule that kicked off the protests remains. But some of the Covid-19 related restrictions that moved others to join truckers in their protests have started to go away.\n\nProvincial public health officials across Canada, who are largely responsible for imposing and lifting most health restrictions, have lifted some measures in recent weeks.\n\nAs the most recent surge of Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant subsided, nearly all provinces have seen a decrease in new hospital admissions – though ICU occupancy remains stubbornly high.\n\nCanada’s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, has said in recent days that it is prudent for provinces to react and adapt health restrictions based on local circumstances.\n\nA protester walks in front of parked trucks on February 8 as demonstrators in Ottawa, Canada, continue to protest the vaccine mandates implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. DAVE CHAN/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nProtesters block access to Alberta-Montana crossing\n\nProtesting truckers also blocked access Tuesday and Wednesday to a border crossing connecting Coutts, Alberta, to Sweet Grass, Montana, Canadian police said.\n\nDemonstrators moved 10 farm tractors and three passenger vehicles onto Alberta’s Highway 4 around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesperson Fraser Logan said.\n\nThe border crossing remained inaccessible Wednesday morning, preventing movement in both directions, Logan said. CNN has reached out to the Canadian Border Services Agency for comment.\n\nThere was little police could do to remove trucks from Highway 4, RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said Tuesday. Even if officers were to detain the truckers blocking the road, they wouldn’t be able to clear the blockade, he said.\n\n“Moving vehicles like these requires special equipment and operators,” Zablocki said.\n\nProtests started in Coutts 12 days ago with more than 250 truckers but as of Tuesday evening had dwindled to around 50, Zablocki said.\n\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney announced Tuesday evening that the province has begun to roll back some Covid-19 restrictions. Albertans won’t need to show proof of their vaccination to eat in restaurants or get into venues; some capacity limits are removed; masks mandates for schools will be removed Monday.\n\nKenney addressed the blockade in the news conference, calling it an inconvenience that’s hurting business across the province.\n\n“I’ve said consistently we welcome the freedom of people to protest lawfully and peaceful, but this is not a lawful protest,” Kenney said. “This and other road blockages constitute a safety hazard a serious interference in the lives of others.”\n\nRoughly 150,000 trucks pass through the Sweet Grass-Coutts border crossing each year, according to US Department of Transportation. The nearest border crossing to the east adds about two hours of travel to a trip; the nearest crossing to the west adds about an hour.\n\nMany Ottawans are at their ‘breaking point’\n\nIn Ottawa, the police department has requested additional resources from Mayor Watson so it can better deal with the unrest.\n\n“We have been 100% full out on this for the last 10 days straight, and we will not rest until it’s done, but we need more help,” Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said Monday.\n\nSloly has been pushing all three levels of government for “whatever they can bring to bear on the permanent, sustainable, lawful, safe resolution of this demonstration,” he said, adding that many Ottawans are at their “breaking point.”\n\n“This is crushing for those residents and their businesses,” he said. “It has to stop, and we are doing everything we can possibly do to stop it. We need more help; we’re asking for that help; and we’re starting to receive that help, but we need more to get this done.”\n\nIn letters the mayor wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada’s minister of safety and Ontario’s premier and solicitor general, he asked for additional officers “to quell the insurrection that the Ottawa Police Service is not able to contain.”\n\nPolice have opened more than 60 criminal investigations linked to the protests and 23 arrests have been made. Charges include mischief, flight from police and menacing. More than 1,300 tickets have been issued for violations ranging from excessive noise and use of fireworks to driving a motor vehicle on a sidewalk.\n\nA small line of semi-trailer trucks line up along northbound I-75 in Detroit as the Ambassador Bridge entrance is blocked off for travel to Canada on February 8. Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press/AP\n\n‘It’s unclear how this ends,’ mayor says\n\nTrudeau on Monday acknowledged protesters had a right to voice their concerns but said residents do not deserve to be harassed in their own neighborhoods.\n\n“This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians, but Canadians know the way to get through it is continuing to listen to science, continuing to lean on each other, continuing to be there for each other,” he said after underscoring that Canadians are tired of Covid-19 health restrictions.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Tuesday, Dilkens, the Windsor mayor, said Canada is a Democratic society, where protesting is acceptable.\n\n“But blocking off the busiest border crossing between our two nations is not ok. So how do we get at least a lane of traffic open in each direction to allow trucks to continue to flow to get goods to market in the US?” Dilkens said.\n\nDilkens added that he’s not sure what protesters’ “end game” is\n\n“It has gathered a head of steam, yes, with folks who are feeling upset about vaccine restrictions or mandates, having to wear a mask,” Dilkens said. “But it’s also been a gathering point and rallying cry for many who are just angry with government in general. And so it is unclear how this ends, and what would make everyone happy so that they go away and stop protesting. We’re not sure.”", "authors": ["Paula Newton Aya Elamroussi Paul P.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick did not issue a ruling from the bench, and it could be weeks to months before a ruling.\n\n“We have a lot of work ahead of us,” McCormick told both side’s attorneys as the trial concluded. “I won’t insult you with the typical talk I give at this point which is settlement is still achievable.”\n\nTesla awarded Musk a pay package in 2018 that helped make him the richest person on Earth. The net value of the compensation package is $50.9 billion today, after Tesla’s valuation soared more than 1,000% at its peak since shareholders approved the package.\n\nPlaintiff Richard Tornetta originally filed the lawsuit in June 2018, alleging that Musk exploited his control of Tesla and the board of directors to secure the compensation to “fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars.” The Delaware Court of Chancery has heard arguments this week in Wilmington.\n\nTornetta and his lawyers allege that Musk and the board failed to uphold their financial responsibilities to shareholders. Tesla says its board of directors has a legal responsibility for shareholders’ money in addition to overseeing management, which includes Musk.\n\nTornetta argued that the huge pay package wasn’t needed to incentivize Musk as he already owned the largest stake of Tesla.\n\nTestimony was heard this week from a who’s-who of Tesla insiders including Musk, board chair Robyn Denholm, former chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja, former board member Antonio Gracias, and board members Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch.\n\nThe trial Friday included testimony from expert witnesses.\n\nKevin Murphy, a University of Southern California business school professor, testified on behalf of Tesla and the other defendants that the pay package was reasonable. He also said that Tesla’s board members were considered independent under NASDAQ’s standards. The independence of the directors is a central theme of the case.\n\nTornetta’s lawyers have highlighted the friendships between Musk and many of his board members who created the deal. Some have vacationed together in places like magician David Copperfield’s private island in the Bahamas, where Musk summoned his brother Kimbal and Gracias in 2017 to determine if James Murdoch should join Tesla’s board, according to Kimbal’s deposition which played in court this week. Murdoch, who described himself as a friend of Elon Musk’s since 2006, joined them on Copperfield’s Island for part of the trip, and joined the board shortly thereafter.\n\nSeveral corporate governance experts told CNN Business that it’s clear Tesla’s board of directors lacks independence from Musk.\n\n“It’s safe to say that Musk has a lot of power – and probably too much power – over the Tesla board,” George S. Georgiev a professor who studies corporate governance at Emory University school of law, told CNN Business. “The Tesla board has been extremely indulgent despite Musk’s many transgressions over the years, including his skirmishes with the SEC.”\n\nDenholm, chair of Tesla’s board, revealed after extensive questioning in her testimony that she was unaware of the details of how Musk handles an SEC settlement that required him to not tweet about certain topics, such as Tesla’s financial condition and new business lines, unless he obtained pre-approval from an “experienced securities lawyer.”\n\nMusk explained in his deposition that he sends certain tweets for approval, and publishes them if he hasn’t heard back in an unspecified amount of time. That arrangement leaves open the possibility of Musk’s tweets being published without the required review.\n\nDenholm first joined Tesla’s board in 2014 and became its chair in 2018 when Musk agreed to step down from that position following SEC charges. She said in her testimony that she interviewed with Musk before joining the board of directors.\n\nGeorgiev said there’s not a lot of precedent for cases like this one because they are either dismissed or settled.\n\nGeorgiev also said this makes an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court more likely, so the case may stretch on. He pointed to a case the compensation of Michael Ovitz, a briefly-tenured Disney CEO, which stretched on for about a decade.\n\nThe Tesla board members who testified generally spoke of the huge pay package as necessary to keep Musk engaged at Tesla.\n\n“He’s got 100 company ideas in his mind. I promise you he’s only done very few of them,” Gracias testified. “And we wanted him focused. We needed him focused.”\n\nMurphy, Tesla’s expert witness, also pushed back Friday on the idea that Tesla shareholders are subsidizing Musk’s Mars mission.\n\n“I don’t think that’s any more true than USC is subsidizing my vacation. They pay me a reasonable wage for reasonable services,” Murphy said.\n\nHe said he didn’t feel that shareholders have a particular interest in how Musk spends his money.\n\n“The fact that Mr. Musk is potentially incentivized by this money is a good thing for Tesla shareholders,” he said.\n\nMusk is also the CEO of SpaceX and created a tunnel and transit venture, the Boring Company, as well as Neuralink, which is working toward putting computer chips in brains. Musk recently acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and has described himself as its “Chief Twit.”\n\nMusk’s brother Kimbal had a slightly different take in his deposition. At the time of the 2018 compensation package, Kimbal said it was “very unlikely” that Elon would walk away from his role of CEO at Tesla.\n\n“He’s responsible to the shareholders to the company. That’s just not how Elon operates,” Kimbal Musk said.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/15/the-excerpt-podcast-us-strikes-at-houthis-again/72232030007/", "title": "The Excerpt podcast: US strikes at Houthis again", "text": "On today's episode of The Excerpt podcast: The U.S. has carried out more strikes on Houthis in Yemen.

Plus, we take a look at Obama's role in the 2024 election, and how a Florida resort gives sick children a chance to just be kids. A US Navy destroyer fired missiles at a Houthi radar site in Yemen earlier today. It was the second attack against militants this week after American and British airstrikes late Thursday. Defense officials said today's strike was against a radar installation used to locate and attack commercial ships in the Red Sea. Thursday's attack was widespread, involving more than 60 military targets in at least 28 locations in retaliation for Houthi strikes on commercial vessels. Houthi said Thursday's US and UK strikes killed at least five people. The two strikes represent a major escalation of US involvement in Middle East fighting since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7th.\n\nThe Houthis are a militia group based in Yemen and backed by Iran. They began attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a major shipping channel, shortly after Hamas attacks in Israel. Houthi leaders have said the attacks were in support of Hamas. They said ships bound for Israel were being targeted, though few of the ships they attacked had direct links to Israel. Militants have used drones and missiles to attack 27 ships since mid-October, according to US Central Command.

Meanwhile, it appears former President Barack Obama is getting more involved with the 2024 race. I caught up with USA TODAY National Political Correspondent Phillip M. Bailey about Obama's role in the election and more. Philip, it's always a treat to have you on. Thanks for making the time.\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nNo problem, man. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPhilip, let's start here. What are some of President Joe Biden's weaknesses right now among key parts of his Democratic base?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nPresident Biden, who has taken some of the scars of governing and has had unpopular numbers for some time now, but as 2024 comes into focus, his lagging numbers among key demographics of the Democratic Party, Hispanic voters, African-American voters, voters aged 35 and younger, that's going to be a coalition that will be essential for him in 2024. And what the USA Today Suffolk University polling has shown is that he's doing pretty poorly with those groups right now at the moment, 10 months out of the election. For example, one in five Black voters told USA Today, in the Suffolk University poll, they'll support a third party candidate in November. You're seeing he's only claiming about 63% of Black voters at this point, which would be historically low from the 87% that Biden carried in 2020.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat role might former President Barack Obama play for Biden in his 2024 campaign? What are Obama alums saying on this?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nPresident Obama is the brightest star in the Democratic constellation. I think this has become a story and an issue because Obama's former Vice President is having a hard time with the coalition that really he helped usher into the Democratic Party, making it a solid requirement for any Democrat running. Remember, Barack Obama was only re-elected and elected President with about 39, 40% of the White vote. So that diverse younger demographic of voters is essential for Democrats. So I think what you're going to see is in talking to surrogates and people who are very close to the former President Barack Obama, they tell me that, look, he's going to take a very active role. He's already taking an earlier active role compared to previous cycles in 2020 or 2022. And you're already seeing him shoulder to shoulder with Biden. In fundraising, they hauled in about $4 million off of one event alone.\n\nSo you're going to see Barack Obama engage, but at the same time, Obama is still remaining the cool, calm, collected persona that he was as President. He understands that this is Biden's campaign. Biden is the President, so he's there as a sounding board largely. We talked to Eric Lesser, former Massachusetts legislator, who worked in the Obama administration. He was talking about how, look, for him, Barack Obama is the bridge in the Democratic Party, the generational bridge. You have a big question about Joe Biden's age and being 81 years old, but at the same time, relatively speaking, Barack Obama is a kid. He's only in his sixties, so he's often seen as the bridge between Biden and younger Democrats, like Maxwell Frost, a Congressman from Florida who Obama has reportedly met with along with AOC and others. So in a lot of ways, we're going to see Obama be the mentor in chief in 2024, not just to younger Democrats and people who are running from city council and state-wide races and federal races all the way up to Joe Biden.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPhilip, is there a downside to kind of going to Obama for this type of help in 2024? Are there any hesitations from the Biden camp on this?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nNo hesitations that I've picked up on, but I do think that there is some aggravation from the Biden campaign about some of these stories and reporting. They certainly, I think, are always sort of wondering why is the focus so much on what President Obama is or isn't doing. Some Biden surrogates and people in and around the campaign will point out that, look, Barack Obama was involved in the 2016 race, and Donald Trump won that one. And I think everyone has an ego, and I don't think that Joe Biden is any different. I think that some of these criticisms coming from certain individuals that used to work for President Obama probably didn't have the best working relationship with Joe Biden when he was Vice President. But, look, a lot of people who work for Joe Biden used to work for Barack Obama. The way it was described to me by sources close to former President Obama was, \"We're like a family.\"\n\nThere's a little bit of dysfunction. There's a little bit of disagreement. I do think that because of Joe Biden's age, there will be a question of is he up to it? Right? There will be a question of can he handle the long haul of this? And I think there is a part of the Biden orbit and a part of the Biden network that probably doesn't want to be seen as too reliant on Barack Obama. I think what you will see happen over the coming weeks and months, Taylor, is that the Biden camp, I think, is going to focus his message, particularly as we see what happens on the Republican side if Donald Trump ends up recapturing Republican nomination. They certainly want this to be a binary choice. But there's a lot of unanswered questions. There's a lot of hypotheticals. And let's always remember, most people are still not paying attention. Right? No votes have been cast yet. These polls and surveys, even ours, are snapshots. They are moments in time. The only poll that matters is the one on election day.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Phillip M. Bailey. 2024 is here. I know we'll chat again throughout this big political year. Thanks so much.\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nTaylor, thank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has announced increased oversight of Boeing's 737 MAX production. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement, quote, \"The grounding of the 737 9 and the multiple production related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system,\" unquote. The move came less than a day after the FAA said it would investigate the aircraft manufacturer's production process. Some 737 MAX 9 jets remain grounded as the FAA works to decide on requirements for hardware inspections that airlines will have to carry out before the return to service. Part of the plane's fuselage ripped apart during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. Previous versions of the 737 MAX were involved in two crashes in 2018 and 2019, killing hundreds of people.\n\n♦\n\nFreezing cold, heavy snow, and even blizzard conditions are hitting millions of Americans at the end of this week into the weekend. The National Weather Service warned of dangerously cold temperatures and a winter storm through the weekend, bringing heavy snow across the Midwest from Iowa to Michigan. More than a thousand flights were canceled at Chicago's airports. And black ice from freezing rain has caused widespread accidents in several areas, including Kansas City. Meanwhile, in the West, two men were rescued after being caught in an avalanche Thursday in Idaho, and a person was reported dead from an avalanche in California on Wednesday.\n\n♦\n\nA nonprofit Florida resort is giving critically ill children the chance to just be kids. I spoke with USA TODAY Consumer Travel Reporter Eve Chen to learn more. Eve, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nEve Chen:\n\nIt's my pleasure.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nEve, let's just start here. What is Give Kids The World Village?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nGive Kids The World Village is an 89-acre nonprofit resort in the Orlando area, and it's exclusively for critically ill kids and their families. Anytime a child makes a wish through a wish-granting organization, so Make-A-Wish, but hundreds throughout the world, 50% of those wishes involve Orlando area attractions, think Disney World, Universal Studios, other places like that. And when they make these wishes and they're granted, they get to stay at this village, which is a fully immersive, fully accessible experience for a whole week for their family.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat's amazing. So what do families say about their experiences here and what it's done for them?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nI spoke to several families. One mom said that going there gave her peace that she didn't know was possible anymore. Having all those doctor's visits and hospital stays back to back, she said she was always looking for what might be coming up next, and this was just a chance to kind of breathe again. Because everything's designed with these families in mind, they don't have to think about all of the hoops to jump through. Another mom said that this was the first place that her child felt like a normally developing child because she didn't have to lift up the wheelchair everywhere. Everything was accessible from the carousel to the rides to the villas that each family gets to stay in. The showers are wheelchair accessible. So one teenage child told the President and CEO of Give Kids The World Village Pamela Landwirth that it was the first time she'd ever taken a shower by herself because she's able to roll in by herself. And these are things that people take for granted, but it's purposely designed for these families and kids to be able to enjoy the things that we all take for granted.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat a remarkable place, Eve. What are you hearing about why it's so vital for some of these kids to see others like themselves at a place like this?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nOne of the things that the President, CEO Pamela Landwirth told me was that it can be very isolating when you're going through an experience like this because no one may be around you. Your friends and your family, they've not gone through this type of medically complex journey before. And so you might see other families like this when you're at the hospital or at the doctor's office. But just to enjoy everyday life, eating a meal, having a fun time doing things and not getting stared at was really big for them because a lot of times if they have a visible illness, they get looks or may feel under a microscope, where here every child is going through some sort of journey like that, so they don't feel alone. One of the kids told me, he's nine years old, he said that every time he met another child, he'd say, \"What kind of surgery did you have to come here?\" So it was totally comfortable for them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt must just be such a powerful sense of relief for them. And Eve, it sounds like some of these kids and families end up returning after their first visit. What can you tell us about these alumni visits?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nSure. So the first trip is that wish trip, and that's just a once in a lifetime experience that's week long. They get to do all the things. They have all their meals covered, their housing. They get tickets to all of the parks and all of these onsite experiences at the resort itself. But then they can also come back twice a year for alumni visits. It's not going to be the same blowout trip as the wish trip, but they can enjoy the onsite amenities that they would have during the previous experiences.\n\nSo every night, they have a nightly party with a different theme. They have a winter wonderland night and a Halloween theme night and a talent show night. And basically, it's a chance for these families to make memories that one mom said they may have missed when they were in the hospital or their kids were not well enough to make these family memories, or if their time with their children is limited because some of these children, unfortunately, are not just critically, but terminally ill. This is a chance to make some memories that they may never get to make down the line. So it's really special to them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nEve Chen covers consumer travel for USA TODAY. Eve, it's such a moving piece. Thanks for coming on and chatting about it.\n\nEve Chen:\n\nThank you so much.

Altman, “a tech whizz before he left primary school”, founded the start-up in 2015 alongside Elon Musk.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nDespite The Atlantic saying that Altman has “zero regrets about letting ChatGPT loose into the world”, Sky News added that his “worst fears” are tech companies causing “significant harm to the world”. For that reason, he’s advocated for government regulation, which would be “critical to mitigate the risks”.\n\nWho is Sam Altman?\n\nAltman grew up in St Louis, Missouri, where he learned to program and “disassemble” a Macintosh when he was eight years old, said Tad Friend in The New Yorker. The Mac “became his lifeline to the world”, and Altman, who came out as gay to his parents at 16, told the publication that “finding AOL chat rooms was transformative”.\n\nHe attended John Burroughs School and “changed the whole school”, according to Madelyn Gray, the college counsellor, when he “addressed the whole community, announcing that he was gay” after a Christian group boycotted a school assembly about sexuality. He asked whether the school wanted to be “a repressive place or one open to different ideas”.\n\nAltman made his way to Stanford to study computer science, but dropped out after two years. He gave up “a precious spot at one of America’s top universities”, said Sky News, which amounts to a “rite of passage for the country’s leading tech entrepreneurs”.\n\nHis first venture was a smartphone app called Loopt, founded in 2005, which let people share their real-time location with others. He raised £30 million with the aid of start-up accelerator Y Combinator. This is an “aggressively geeky” three-month boot camp, run twice a year, in how to become a “‘unicorn’ – Valleyspeak for a billion-dollar company”, according to The New Yorker. Altman became a partner of Y Combinator in 2011, then its president in 2014. He then turned his attention to his next start-up, OpenAI, the following year, and stepped back from Y Combinator in 2019.\n\nWhy did Altman co-create OpenAI?\n\nAltman created OpenAI with Musk in 2015 as a “hedged bet on the end of human predominance”; it was born of “Musk’s conviction that an AI could wipe us out by accident”.\n\nLaunching a start-up back then was “akin to assembling an alt-rock band in 1996 or protesting the Vietnam War in 1971 – an act of youthful rebellion gone conformist”, said Friend in The New Yorker. “Like everyone in Silicon Valley, Altman professes to want to save the world; unlike almost everyone there, he has a plan to do it,” Friend added.\n\nUnder his leadership, OpenAI is no longer a non-profit, and has an estimated value of $29 billion, according to Sky News, thanks to the “remarkable success of its generative AI tools” including ChatGPT and DALL-E.\n\nWhat next for Altman and OpenAI?\n\n“For all the wonder” generative AI is providing, it’s matched by concerns including “spreading disinformation or making jobs redundant”. Governments are also “scrambling” to effectively regulate a technology that “seems destined to change the world forever”. These are also among Altman’s “worst fears”. For this reason, he “appears keen to be a willing participant” in the responsible use of AI and how regulation should be shaped.\n\nThe Silicon Valley CEO, however, sees releasing the technology as “a great public service”, said The Atlantic. He also added that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop”. This is something he “doesn’t seem to be too stressed about”, said The Byte, and says a “world with AI will be better – though it sounds like he isn’t quite sure what that world will look like”.\n\nAltman is preparing for what comes next through other ventures including Tools for Humanity, which recently launched a new cryptocurrency project, Worldcoin. The aim, according to Wired, is to create a global ID system that will “help reliably differentiate between humans and AI, in preparation for when intelligence is no longer a reliable indicator of personhood”.", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/08/social-security-overpayments-march-2025/82049805007/", "title": "Social Security overpayments: Agency to recover 100% of overpaid ...", "text": "If Social Security accidentally overpays you, be prepared to pay back the funds.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) will begin recouping 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries starting March 27, the agency said in a notice Friday. That's a reversal of a March 2024 change to withhold only 10% of a recipient's benefits in event of an overpayment to reduce \"financial hardship on people with overpayments,\" the agency said at the time.\n\nThat change came after the SSA faced criticism in 2023 – and disparaging media coverage from KFF Health News and Cox Media Group Television Stations and \"60 Minutes\" – about how it went about collecting overpayments, some of which happened more than a decade ago.\n\nIn some cases, people lost their homes as benefits were cut off to make up an overpayment. \"Innocent people can be badly hurt,\" then-Social Security chief Martin O'Malley said, according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNow, the administration is reinstating the previous overpayment recovery strategy. That means as of March 27, any Social Security overpayments found will result in withholding of 100% of the recipient's benefits until the overpayment is made up, the agency said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe withholding rate will not change for those beneficiaries currently reimbursing an overpayment, the agency said. Also, the withholding rate for overpayments of Supplemental Security Income benefits will remain at 10%.\n\nThe change comes as President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, have sought to cut federal spending. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is planning reduce its workforce by more than 12%, cutting 7,000 employees, it announced on Friday.\n\nAs for the Social Security program, Trump has promised not to cut benefits. \"Social Security won't be touched, other than if there's fraud or something. It's going to be strengthened. But it won't be touched,\" he told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Feb. 18.\n\n'Vampires' in Social Security data?: Here's what to know after Elon Musk claims SSA fraud\n\nSocial Security: Fraud and overpayments\n\nTrump and Musk have alleged widespread fraud in the Social Security program. During his speech to Congress on March 3, Trump mentioned \"probable fraud,\" with millions of benefit recipients over the age of 100 in the system.\n\nBut those claims are contradicted by a 2023 report from the nonpartisan inspector general for the Social Security Administration, which found about 18.9 million 100-plus aged people without death information in the agency's records, but none were getting benefits.\n\nLess than 1% of payments are improper and most are overpayments, found a July 2024 report from Social Security’s inspector general.\n\nThe agency is required to get back those overpayments, said Lee Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, in the notice posted on the agency website. “We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,” he wrote. “It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds.”\n\nThe change is expected to result in overpayment recoveries of about $7 billion in the next decade, according to The Office of the Chief Actuary, the agency said.\n\nWhat is a Social Security overpayment?\n\nSocial Security pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year to about 70 million people monthly. An overpayment involves a beneficiary getting more money than they should have gotten.\n\n\"Overpayments happen for several reasons, such as a beneficiary neglecting to update their income, marital status or work situation, or the SSA miscalculating how much it should pay,\" advises finance site NerdWallet. \"Regardless of who is at fault, beneficiaries who receive overpayments from the Social Security Administration usually have to give back the money. Because taxpayer money funds Social Security benefits, the SSA is legally required to recover overpayments.\"\n\nDuring fiscal years 2015 to 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, but made $71.8 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, according to the July 2024 inspector general's report.\n\nAnother report by the agency's inspector general, issued in 2022, found that 73,000 overpayments were the fault of the SSA due to lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"\n\nIf the agency determines a beneficiary has been overpaid, it will send them an overpayment notice.\n\nIf Social Security overpaid you, how do you pay it back?\n\nAny beneficiary found to have been overpaid will \"automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" according to Friday's notice. That means benefits will be docked until the overpayment amount is met.\n\n\"If someone cannot afford full recovery of their overpayment, they can contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 or their local office to request a lower rate of recovery,\" the agency said in the notice.\n\nThe SSA typically begins withholding from benefits about 60 days after notifying beneficiaries about the overpayment.\n\nYou can repay the overpayment by credit card, online bill pay or check. For more information on repayment of overpaid benefits, visit the SSA website.\n\nThe SSA can also take money from your federal tax refund or garnish your wages if you were overpaid and are not getting benefits anymore or become delinquent in a repayment agreement, the agency has said. Delinquencies will be reported to credit bureaus.\n\nCan you appeal a Social Security overpayment?\n\nIf you are sent an overpayment notice, you can appeal the decision or the amount, the agency has said. Beneficiaries can also also ask Social Security to waive collection of the overpayment, if they believe it was not their fault and can’t afford to pay it back.\n\nHow to avoid an overpayment of Social Security benefits\n\nThere are some steps you can take to avoid an overpayment, according to NerdWallet:\n\nStay up to date: Report your monthly income, marital status and any available resources that may affect the amount of your benefits. You can call the agency to update your information or access your my Social Security account online.\n\nReport your monthly income, marital status and any available resources that may affect the amount of your benefits.

Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping both stopped escalating tariffs after the deal was signed.\n\nThe deal required China to meet its purchase commitments by the end of 2021. While China was never on track to meet the target number, a new report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics gives the first complete picture of how much was purchased over the two-year period.\n\nUltimately, China bought only 57% of the US exports it had committed to purchase under the agreement, according to the report, which analyzed new trade data from the Department of Commerce.\n\n“China bought none of the additional $200 billion of exports Trump’s deal had promised,” wrote Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the institute, in his report.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic slowed trade around the globe just weeks after the deal was signed, making it even harder for Beijing to meet its purchase commitment.\n\nBut experts had been skeptical from the start that China would be able to meet the ambitious purchase commitments, which set specific amounts for different categories including manufacturing, agriculture, services and energy. After roughly 18 months of tariff escalation that nearly halted trade for some US exporters, relationships with Chinese buyers were frayed and had to be rebuilt. Plus, the deal left tariffs in place, keeping the prices of US goods elevated.\n\nFarmers, who were hit particularly hard by the trade war, saw agricultural exports to China return to 2017 levels, but they still fell short of China’s commitment. Soybeans, for example, fell more than 30% short of the target. The Trump administration made about $28 billion in aid payments to help farmers hurt by the tariffs stay afloat.\n\nWhite House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told CNN’s “New Day” on Wednesday that the White House is concerned that China hasn’t lived up to its commitments.\n\nHe blamed some of China’s failure on “the flawed nature of the trade agreement,” but added, “we think it’s feasible and practical to make them live up to their agreements, but also reset the trade relationship.”\n\nDeese said the Biden administration will focus on areas where Chinese action is posing “strategic threats to our economy.”\n\nBiden leaves tariffs in place\n\nThe Phase One agreement didn’t include any repercussions for China if it missed its goals.\n\nBut President Joe Biden suggested last month that China’s failure to meet the purchase commitments is the reason he’s leaving Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods in place, despite facing pressure from the US business community to lift them.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” Biden said at the time.\n\nMembers of the Office of the US Trade Representative have been talking to their Chinese counterparts about the Phase One commitments since the fall.\n\n“We have engaged the PRC (People’s Republic of China) on its shortfalls for months, but have not seen real signs towards making good on the purchase commitments and our patience is wearing thin,” said Adam Hodge, spokesperson for the US trade representative, in a statement sent to CNN.\n\n“Regardless of how these negotiations conclude, the fact remains that the Phase One agreement did not address the core problems with the PRC’s state-led economy,” he added.\n\nTrump’s tariffs were imposed on $350 billion in Chinese goods, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers.\n\nThe tariffs make it more expensive for American businesses to import these goods from China, many of which are not manufactured in the United States at a pace that meets the demand. They also hurt manufacturers who need to import certain component parts.\n\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said China’s failure to meet the goals is a clear sign that the US must pivot its strategy.\n\n“Anyone who has followed US-China trade closely over the past 20 years can tell you that until the fundamental issues are addressed – things like China’s state-owned enterprises, massive government subsidies, intellectual property theft, lax labor and environmental laws – the massive trade gap will remain,” Paul said in a statement.\n\nBiden is backing a sweeping piece of legislation moving through Congress that aims to counter China’s growing economic influence. It calls for investing billions of dollars in US semiconductor manufacturing and improving the nation’s supply chains, as well as making a number of changes to trade policy aimed at creating a level playing field for American businesses.\n\nThe bill passed the House last week and lawmakers must now reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation before it’s sent to Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}]}

The future Hollywood star was named Norma Jeane Mortenson at birth (though she was later baptised as Norma Jeane Baker) and her father was listed as Martin Edward Mortensen – the man to whom Gladys was previously married.\n\nHowever, said Radio Times’s Patrick Cremona, “it seems that he was not actually her real father and had in fact separated from Gladys long before Norma Jeane was born”. The true identity of her father remained uncertain until earlier this year.\n\nSix decades after Monroe’s death at the age of 36, a DNA test confirmed that she had been fathered by Gifford, with whom Gladys had an affair while working as a film negative cutter.\n\nRKO Studios supervisor Gifford “left a pregnant Gladys soon after their dalliance”, said the i news site, and played “no role in Monroe’s upbringing, keeping his distance for the duration of her life”.\n\nHow much the “blonde bombshell knew about her dad” is unclear, said The Sun, “as Gladys never openly revealed his identity”.\n\nBut Monroe “said her mother had shown her a photo of a man in a golden frame and would say, ‘this is your father’”, the paper reported.\n\nMonroe tried to contact Gifford several times over the years, but was rebuffed. In 1996 documentary Marilyn Monroe: The Mortal Goddess, the late actor’s former husband, police officer James Dougherty, said: “He wouldn’t recognise her. He said, ‘No, I don’t know who you are. See my attorney.’”\n\nHowever, Gifford did send a get-well card to Monroe while she was in hospital, according to Julien’s Auctions, which is putting the letter under the hammer during an online sale on 17 and 18 December.\n\nThe card shows a girl standing on a musical note and the message inside spells Monroe’s first name incorrectly, starting “Dear Marylyn”. Pre-printed text follows, saying: “This cheery little get-well note comes specially to say that lots of thoughts and wishes, too, are with you every day.”\n\nGifford then wrote “a little prayer too”, followed by his full name and address at a dairy farm in California that he had established after remarrying.\n\nGifford, who fathered two other children, died of a heart attack at the age of 66 in 1965 – three years after Monroe died of an apparent overdose.\n\nFact or fiction?\n\nMonroe’s family relationships are explored in a critically panned movie titled Blonde that was released on Netflix in September.\n\n“Rather than being a traditional biopic,” said Radio Times’s Cremona, “the film is an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates's fictionalised novel of the same name – mixing fact with fiction to paint a portrait of a deeply troubled life.”\n\nMonroe, played by Ana de Armas, is shown reacting “to her lack of a father figure in a number of ways”, including “referring to several of her lovers as ‘Daddy’”.\n\nIn one scene, Monroe “is told that there is a surprise waiting for her in her hotel room” and is “convinced that she’s about to be reunited with her long-lost father”, Cremona continued. But the “specifics” of some of these incidents in the film “don’t match up to reality”.\n\nA documentary released in June, Marilyn, Her Final Secret, helped to set the record straight about her father’s identity. Directed by Francois Pomès, the film features DNA tests by scientists who used a hair sample from Monroe and cheek swab samples from Gifford’s granddaughter, Francine, and great-granddaughter, Lisa.\n\n“The hair that we used from Monroe was collected by the person who embalmed her body the day she died and we were able to draw up 22% of her genetic profile from that thanks to a DNA fragment found in the keratin,” Pomès told Variety.\n\nThe director-producer said he had “spent years and sleepless nights” trying to confirm who Monroe’s father was and break a “family secret”.\n\n“The thing that touched me the most was seeing the reaction of Gifford’s family, who were overwhelmed by this irrefutable evidence,” Pomès added.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/society/957245/the-pros-and-cons-of-legalising-assisted-dying", "title": "Pros and cons of legalising euthanasia | The Week", "text": "A new assisted dying law for England and Wales could take up to four years to fully implement, raising concern among supporters that it may never pass.\n\nThe controversial Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would make it legal for people who are over 18 and terminally ill to receive assistance to end their life, passed a second reading in November after MPs were given a free vote.\n\nYesterday, Kim Leadbeater, the MP leading the bill, proposed extending the initial timeline for its implementation from two years to four. Her spokesperson said this was more of a \"backstop\" than a \"target\", but if it is delayed beyond the next election, it risks being \"abandoned altogether\", said Tom Gordon, a Liberal Democrat MP who sits on the Commons committee scrutinising the bill.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

She wants to help people avoid the \"deep-rooted agony\" at the end of life.\n\nCon: losing legal protection\n\nIt is currently a criminal offence under the 1961 Suicide Act to help someone take their own life, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Assisted dying is a general term that includes euthanasia and assisted suicide. Euthanasia is when a doctor ends a patient's life, while assisted suicide is when a patient ends their own life with a doctor's help.\n\nSome people believe that legalising euthanasia would put too much power in the hands of doctors, who could abuse their position, or relatives.\n\nThe debate comes amid a \"sharp rise in cases of euthanasia to end psychological suffering\" in the Netherlands, which introduced the legislation in 2001, said The Times. The number of deaths under the legislation reached nearly 10,000 last year, which marks 5.8% of all deaths and includes a 60% increase in cases involving psychological suffering.\n\nHowever, the UK bill excludes disability and mental illness as eligibility criteria. It sets out specific requirements for who is eligible to receive assistance, including the need to have the \"mental capacity to make a choice\" and that they are \"expected to die within six months\". Two independent doctors must make assessments before a high court judge makes a final ruling.\n\nPro: ending 'mercy killings'\n\nAccording to Dignity in Dying, 44% of people would break the law and help a loved one to die, risking 14 years in prison.\n\nIn 2023 the Crown Prosecution Service updated its guidance on so-called mercy killings and suicide pacts to reflect that there is no public interest in prosecuting individuals who end the life of someone who has made \"a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision that they wished for their life to end\".\n\nEncouraging or assisting suicide is a crime that currently carries a maximum penalty of 14 years but prosecutions are \"rare\", said Humanists UK. Campaigners claim that UK police are also increasingly turning a blind eye to people travelling to other countries to assist loved ones to end their life.\n\nCon: 'slippery slope'\n\nOpponents argue that normalising euthanasia would be a move towards legalised murder.\n\nThey say that even with \"watertight qualifying criteria and safeguards\" the law will be \"expanded in time and the restrictions loosened\", said The Guardian. A \"pressing concern for lawyers\" is \"successful human rights challenges\" by people who were not granted assisted dying, inevitably softening the law in a way which wasn't initially intended by MPs.\n\nIn his role as the then archbishop of Canterbury, last year Justin Welby warned that the bill would set the country in a \"dangerous\" direction, leading to a \"slippery slope\". But Leadbeater has rejected this argument, saying \"we have to get it right from the start with very clear criteria, safeguards and protections\".\n\nPro: shifting opinion\n\nThere has been a significant shift in recent years among both the public and professional medical opinion regarding assisted dying for people with a terminal illness.\n\nAccording to a November YouGov poll, 73% of Britons believe \"in principle\" that assisted dying should be permitted in the UK, while 13% do not. Only a minority are opposed to it \"in principle and in practice\", while 19% say they support the principle but do not believe it is \"possible to create adequate laws to regulate it\".\n\nA 2020 survey by Dignity in Dying revealed opinion was also shifting among doctors, with 50% \"in favour of law change on assisted dying\" and 39% opposed.\n\nCon: religious concerns\n\nMany religions and religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only.\n\nAt his New Year's Day Mass in the Vatican this year, Pope Francis called on his followers to \"respect the dignity of human life from conception to natural death\", and a \"firm commitment\" to defend \"the precious gift of life, life in the womb, the lives of children, the lives of the suffering, the poor, the elderly, the lonely and the dying\".", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

Flores-Ruiz is facing three misdemeanor battery counts.\n\nTwo federal agents eventually chased Flores-Ruiz down outside the courthouse and apprehended him at a downtown Milwaukee intersection, according to the complaint.\n\nWho is Hannah Dugan? The Wisconsin judge arrested by FBI amid ICE investigation\n\nJudge Dugan makes brief appearance in federal courtroom\n\nOn April 25, Dugan appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Dries during a brief hearing in a packed courtroom at the federal courthouse. Dugan, wearing a black dress with white flowers, made no public comments during the brief hearing.\n\nAt the hearing, Dries asked if prosecutors were seeking detention, and they said they were not. He answered that he did not believe that the charges were “eligible” for detention.\n\nAs it ended, her attorney, Craig Mastantuono, told the court: \"Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.\"\n\nDugan made her federal court appearance a little more than two hours after she was arrested at the county courthouse at about 8 a.m. April 25.\n\nFederal prosecutors Kelly Watzka and Keith Alexander declined to comment as they walked out of the courtroom after a brief hearing.\n\nReaction to Dugan's arrest grew nationally\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X: \"I can confirm that our @FBI agents just arrested Hannah Dugan – a county judge in Milwaukee – for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid an arrest by @ICEgov.\"\n\nEarlier, FBI Director Kash Patel posted, deleted and then reposted a tweet about the arrest.\n\n\"Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction — after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,\" Patel wrote. \"We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest.\"\n\nMultiple Milwaukee County judges confirmed that the arrest took place at the courthouse.\n\nFranklyn Gimbel, a prominent Milwaukee defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, called Dugan’s arrest “outrageous.”\n\n“A person who is a judge, who has a residence who has no problem being found, should not be arrested, if you will, like some common criminal,” Gimbel said. “And I'm shocked and surprised that the US Attorney's office or the FBI would not have invited her to show up and accept process if they're going to charge her with a crime.”\n\nWisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin described the arrest as an example of governmental overreach by the Trump administration.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson also slammed the Trump administration’s move, calling it “ham-handed,\" “haphazard” and being more about “showboating” than about keeping the city's community safe.\n\n“If a judge is being arrested in a courthouse, just imagine the chilling effect that it sends to other folks who would otherwise participate in judicial proceedings in our courthouse – and not just in the Milwaukee County Courthouse, but courthouses across the state of Wisconsin and courthouses across the United States,” Johnson said.\n\nWisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, the state's top Republican, said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"\n\nWisconsin GOP Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considering a run for governor in 2026, wrote on X: \"If you help illegal aliens evade arrest, you will be arrested.\"\n\nTiffany had attacked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers over a memo sent to state employees that provided instructions on how to interact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities who visit state buildings.\n\nState employees, Tiffany said, should now \"think twice\" before following such guidance.\n\nOn April 25, a group of protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee chanting: “No justice, no peace. Let the judge be released.” Some held signs that read, “Justice 4 all” and “Judge arrest = Trump guilt.”\n\nAt the end, protesters linked arms and stood in front of the courthouse doors and vowed to return.\n\nDugan accused of assisting undocumented defendant facing misdemeanor charges\n\nThe complaint says federal officials used biometric fingerprint comparisons to see that Flores-Ruiz, who was set to appear before Dugan, had been deported from the United States in 2013. ICE officials obtained an arrest warrant for Flores-Ruiz on April 17.\n\nA day later, six members of the Milwaukee ICE task force dressed in plain clothes and went to the county courthouse to arrest Flores-Ruiz at about 8 a.m., the complaint says. They then informed the bailiff in Dugan's courtroom that they were planning the arrest, agreeing to wait to do so until after his court appearance.\n\nA clerk notified Dugan that it appeared ICE agents were waiting in the hallway outside of her courtroom.\n\n\"Judge DUGAN became visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers,\" the complaint said.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Dugan confronted members of the arrest team while \"visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor.\" She told the group members they needed a judicial warrant, not an administrative one, and directed them to report to Chief Judge Carl Ashley's office.\n\nWhile this was going on, the bailiff informed the arrest team — which included ICE, FBI and Drug Enforcement Agency officials — that Dugan had expedited Flores-Ruiz's case. Witnesses told federal authorities that she then \"forcefully motioned\" for the defendant and his attorney to exit through a side door near the jury box that leads to a private hallway and then to the public area outside the courtroom.\n\nA DEA agent then saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney get on an elevator, and he got on it with them, notifying others on the arrest team what was happening. Flores-Ruiz got off the elevator and was confronted by two agents outside the courthouse.\n\n\"A foot chase ensued,\" the complaint said. \"The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained.\"\n\nRecords show Flore-Ruiz was charged on April 24 by federal authorities with illegal re-entry into the United States.\n\nIn an federal court appeance the same day, Flores-Ruiz's federal attorney Marty Pruhs said a judge assisted his client and that Flores-Ruiz was acting on the advice of his state attorney. Minutes from the court hearing said Flores-Ruiz, who has been working as a cook, has been living in Milwaukee for about 12 years.\n\nFlores-Ruiz is listed as being in ICE custody at Dodge Detention Facility in Juneau, according to the federal online detainee locator system.\n\nThat arrest marked at least the third time in recent months that federal immigration agents have come to the courthouse with arrest warrants. In March and early April, two people were arrested by ICE officials in the hallways of the courthouse.\n\nRecords show that Dugan had 25 cases on the morning of April 18. Flores-Ruiz's case was set for 8:30 a.m. He does not appear to have any other state or federal criminal offenses or charges.\n\nAccording to his criminal complaint, Flores-Ruiz is charged with three counts of misdemeanor battery. The charges include modifiers for domestic violence that could subject him to additional punishment if he is convicted.\n\nThe case stemmed from a fight on March 12 between two roommates at a home on the 3900 block of West Vliet Street. No one answered the door when the Journal Sentinel visited his residence April 23.\n\nThe criminal complaint said a fight occurred after Flores-Ruiz was accused of playing music too loudly in the home. The complaint alleges Flores-Ruiz punched another person 30 times, then struck a woman who tried to break up the melee.\n\nEach of the three Class A misdemeanors has a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine.\n\nDugan was elected to Branch 31 of the Circuit Court in 2016 by knocking off an appointee of former Wisconsin Republican Gov.

While arresting a state judge is not unprecedented, the way this arrest was effectuated is jarring. They placed her in handcuffs, did so in the county courthouse (a public and symbolic place), and delivered her into US Marshal custody.\n\nAs standard procedure, she was processed and placed into a holding cell behind bars in the federal courthouse. She was eventually escorted to the federal courtroom, passing several other courtrooms while handcuffed and shackled. Regardless of whether Dugan’s earlier actions rise to the level of federal crimes, there was no reason to physically detain her other than to create a spectacle and intimidate other judges.\n\nAs a former federal prosecutor and a former public defender, we know that Dugan’s arrest was far outside the norm. The Department of Justice charges people with crimes every day, but it does not routinely send federal law enforcement officers to make arrests. Arrests are typically reserved for individuals accused of violent crimes, those considered flight risks, or those likely to destroy evidence or harm or intimidate others.\n\nTrump was never arrested in cases where he was charged\n\nIn contrast to Dugan, President Trump, for example, was never arrested for any of the alleged crimes charged against him. He was given court dates to appear, and he showed up. People like Dugan – a woman of faith with no criminal history and a longtime resident of her community – are almost always afforded the opportunity to voluntarily appear to answer the charges against them. So what was different in this case? Her arrest was intended to send a message.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nShortly after the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi almost explicitly said as much. Speaking on Fox News, she called “the judiciary” “deranged” and declared that “if you are harboring a fugitive…we will come after you and we will prosecute you.” While we don’t know all the facts that support the charges against Dugan (although legal experts are raising good questions about the evidence), we do know three things: that no one is above the law, that the accused are innocent until proven guilty, and that we have a criminal justice system to determine whether or not individuals violated the law.\n\nWe also know that Dugan’s public arrest in the county courthouse under the circumstances of this case has very little to do with justice. It is instead the latest escalation in the Trump administration’s quest to subjugate the other two branches of government and overpower the sovereignty of individual states.\n\nBondi’s comments should be considered against the backdrop of others she and Trump officials have made challenging the authority of judges who rule against them. Their message to judges is clear: don’t cross the administration's priorities. Hardworking state court judges across Wisconsin and the country doing their best every day to administer justice will likely be thinking: Am I doing something that would paint a target on my back?\n\nBondi's comments smack of behavior of authoritarian regimes\n\nIn other countries, authoritarian regimes – whether they come from the political left or right – want judges to do what scholars of authoritarianism call “obeying in advance.” It means that they will calculate their rulings and behavior so as to avoid becoming a target of the government. Their anticipatory compliance will, in turn, give the authoritarian unchecked power to do whatever it wants.\n\nBut in America, we have our Constitution – drafted for the people, by the people – which was written specifically for the purpose of preventing anyone from achieving the powers of a king. The spectacle of Dugan’s arrest appears to mark the beginning of a fear campaign. We must remain on high alert to prevent further slide into authoritarianism.\n\nBut remember, we still live in a democratic republic. By continuing to uphold the freedoms and obligations granted by the Constitution, all of us, including judges, (and academics and the media, for that matter) can send our own message right back to the federal government: we will stand firm to protect our democratic principles of liberty and justice for all.\n\nDeja Vishny is a criminal defense attorney and former Wisconsin assistant public defender.

No one is above the law.\"\n\nWhat is Hannah Dugan charged with?\n\nDugan is charged with two federal counts: obstruction and concealing an individual.\n\nDugan is charged with obstruction of a federal agency, which is a felony; and with concealing a person to help them avoid arrest, a misdemeanor.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel initially reported Dugan was facing two felonies.\n\nUnder federal law, a concealing charge can be a felony or a misdemeanor — depending on the crime that person being sought is facing.\n\nIn this case, there was a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, signed by an immigration officer. That was the warrant federal agents had on April 18 when they came to the Milwaukee County courthouse to arrest him.\n\nAfter that arrest, Flores-Ruiz was charged with a felony re-entry, after allegedly coming back into the U.S. after he was deported in 13 years ago. Flores-Ruiz was not yet charged with that felony the day federal officers came to arrest him at the state courthouse.\n\nWhat happened in Hannah Dugan's courtroom with the undocumented immigrant?\n\nOn April 18, Immigrants and Customs Enforcement agents arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse with an arrest agent for an individual, according to an email Chief Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Carl Ashley sent to judges that same day.\n\nAshley's email did not mention Dugan or the defendant by name. However, he said the ICE agents went to the sixth floor, which is where Dugan's courtroom is located. Ashley said the agents presented a warrant, but Dugan responded to the email saying, \"a warrant was not presented in the hallway on the 6th floor.\"\n\nWhen ICE officials left to meet with the chief judge, Dugan reportedly took the defendant to a side door in the courtroom and directed them down a private hallway and into the public area on the 6th floor, sources told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel spoke with five legal experts earlier about the case. None thought Dugan's actions constituted a federal crime.\n\nWho is Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the immigrant Hannah Dugan is accused of assisting?\n\nOfficials have not confirmed the identity of the defendant who Dugan reportedly assisted, but it appears to be Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 30.\n\nFlores-Ruiz, a Mexican immigrant, was mentioned by name in Patel's deleted X post.\n\nFlores-Ruiz was set to appear in Dugan's courtroom for a pre-trial conference on three misdemeanor counts of battery on April 18 at 8:30 a.m. — the same morning the ICE agents came to the courthouse.\n\nAs of April 23, Flores-Ruiz is listed as being in ICE custody at Dodge Detention Facility in Juneau, according to the federal online detainee locator system.\n\nAccording to his criminal complaint, Flores-Ruiz is charged with three counts of misdemeanor battery.\n\nThe case stemmed from a March 12 fight between roommates at a home on the 3900 block of West Vliet Street.

The two charges carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine, but sentences in cases involving nonviolent offenses typically are much shorter.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint says Dugan assisted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, avoid being arrested by federal immigration officials at the Milwaukee County Courthouse after he appeared in her courtroom for a pretrial conference on April 18.

Though she was initially in federal custody, she was not in a jumpsuit when she appeared in court but was instead wearing a black dress with white flowers.\n\nFederal prosecutors Kelly Watzka and Keith Alexander declined to comment as they walked out of the courtroom after a brief hearing.\n\nReaction to Dugan's arrest grew nationally\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X: \"I can confirm that our @FBI agents just arrested Hannah Dugan – a county judge in Milwaukee – for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid an arrest by @ICEgov.\"\n\nEarlier, FBI Director Kash Patel posted, deleted and then reposted a tweet about the arrest.\n\n\"Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction — after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,\" Patel wrote. \"We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest.\"\n\nMultiple Milwaukee County judges confirmed that the arrest took place at the courthouse.\n\nFranklyn Gimbel, a prominent Milwaukee defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, called Dugan’s arrest “outrageous.”\n\n“A person who is a judge, who has a residence who has no problem being found, should not be arrested, if you will, like some common criminal,” Gimbel said. “And I'm shocked and surprised that the U.S. Attorney's Office or the FBI would not have invited her to show up and accept process if they're going to charge her with a crime.”\n\nU.S. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin described the arrest as an example of governmental overreach by the Trump administration.\n\nMayor Cavalier Johnson also slammed the Trump administration’s move, calling it “ham-handed,\" “haphazard” and being more about “showboating” than about keeping Milwaukee’s community safe.\n\n“If a judge is being arrested in a courthouse, just imagine the chilling effect that it sends to other folks who would otherwise participate in judicial proceedings in our courthouse – and not just in the Milwaukee County Courthouse, but courthouses across the state of Wisconsin and courthouses across the United States,” Johnson said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, the state's top Republican, said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considering a run for governor in 2026, wrote on X: \"If you help illegal aliens evade arrest, you will be arrested.\"\n\nTiffany had attacked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers over a memo sent to state employees that provided instructions on how to interact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities who visit state buildings.\n\nState employees, Tiffany said, should now \"think twice\" before following such guidance.\n\nOn Friday, a group of protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee chanting: “No justice, no peace. Let the judge be released.” Some held signs that read, “Justice 4 all” and “Judge arrest = Trump guilt.”\n\nAt the end, protesters linked arms and stood in front of the courthouse doors and vowed to return.\n\nDugan accused of assisting undocumented defendant facing misdemeanor charges\n\nThe complaint says federal officials used biometric fingerprint comparisons to see that Flores-Ruiz, who was set to appear before Dugan on April 18, had been deported from the United States in 2013. ICE officials obtained an arrest warrant for Flores-Ruiz on April 17.\n\nA day later, six members of the Milwaukee ICE task force dressed in plain clothes and went to the county courthouse to arrest Flores-Ruiz at about 8 a.m., the complaint says. They then informed the bailiff in Dugan's courtroom that they were planning the arrest, agreeing to wait to do so until after his court appearance.\n\nA clerk notified Dugan that it appeared ICE agents were waiting in the hallway outside her courtroom.\n\n\"Judge DUGAN became visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers,\" the complaint said.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Dugan confronted members of the arrest team while \"visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor.\" She told the group members they needed a judicial warrant, not an administrative one, and directed them to report to Chief Judge Carl Ashley's office.\n\nWhile this was going on, the bailiff informed the arrest team — which included ICE, FBI and Drug Enforcement Agency officials — that Dugan had expedited Flores-Ruiz's case. Witnesses told federal authorities that she then \"forcefully motioned\" for the defendant and his attorney to exit through a side door near the jury box that leads to a private hallway and then to the public area outside the courtroom.\n\nA DEA agent then saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney get on an elevator, and he got on it with them, notifying others on the arrest team what was happening. Flores-Ruiz got off the elevator and was confronted by two agents outside the courthouse.\n\n\"A foot chase ensued,\" the complaint said. \"The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained.\"\n\nRecords show Flores-Ruiz was charged April 24 by federal authorities with illegal re-entry into the United States.\n\nIn an federal court appearance the same day, Flores-Ruiz's federal attorney Marty Pruhs said a judge assisted his client and that Flores-Ruiz was acting on the advice of his state attorney. Minutes from the court hearing said Flores-Ruiz, who has been working as a cook, has been living in Milwaukee for about 12 years.\n\nFlores-Ruiz is listed as being in ICE custody at Dodge Detention Facility in Juneau, according to the federal online detainee locator system.\n\nThat arrest marked at least the third time in recent months that federal immigration agents have come to the courthouse with arrest warrants. In March and early April, two people were arrested by ICE officials in the hallways of the courthouse.\n\nRecords show that Dugan had 25 cases on the morning of April 18. Flores-Ruiz's case was set for 8:30 a.m. He does not appear to have any other state or federal criminal offenses or charges.\n\nAccording to his criminal complaint, Flores-Ruiz is charged with three counts of misdemeanor battery. The charges include modifiers for domestic violence that could subject him to additional punishment if he is convicted.\n\nThe case stemmed from a fight on March 12 between two roommates at a home on the 3900 block of West Vliet Street. No one answered the door when the Journal Sentinel visited his residence April 23.\n\nThe criminal complaint said a fight occurred after Flores-Ruiz was accused of playing music too loudly in the home. The complaint alleges Flores-Ruiz punched another person 30 times, then struck a woman who tried to break up the melee.\n\nEach of the three Class A misdemeanors has a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine.\n\nDugan was elected to Branch 31 of the Circuit Court in 2016 by knocking off an appointee of Republican Gov.

Flores-Ruiz is facing three misdemeanor battery counts.\n\nThe two charges against Dugan carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine.\n\nHere's what to know about her charges and upcoming court date.\n\nWhen will Judge Hannah Dugan appear in court again?\n\nDugan is scheduled for a May 15 preliminary hearing and possible arraignment before Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Dries.\n\nWhat evidence did investigators share about Dugan's alleged misconduct?\n\nAccording to the complaint:\n\nAhead of Flores-Ruiz's court hearing, members of the Milwaukee Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations Task Force developed a plan to arrest Flores-Ruiz in a public area outside of Dugan's courtroom.\n\nWitnesses told investigators that Dugan guided Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to a jury door that leads to a private hallway solely used by deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies.\n\nBecause the hallway was not accessible to the public, the complaint says, Flores-Ruiz was intentionally concealed from arrest.\n\nFlores-Ruiz was apprehended by FBI agents and ICE officials after a footchase outside the courthouse.\n\nWill Dugan face a trial?\n\nDugan is facing federal criminal charges; her case will eventually go before a grand jury.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney for Wisconsin's Eastern District will present evidence to the grand jury to determine whether there is \"probable cause\" to believe a crime has been committed by Dugan.\n\nGrand juries usually consist of 16 to 23 members.\n\nIf the grand jury decides there is enough evidence, it returns an indictment against the defendant. An indictment is a formal notice that the individual has committed a crime.\n\nA grand jury does not decide civil disputes or determine guilt or innocence, according to the United States District Court.\n\nIs Dugan still doing work as a judge?\n\nNo.\n\nDugan's cases on April 25, the day she was arrested, were being handled by Judge Laura Crivello, according to a sign on her courtroom door.\n\nBy April 28, David Feiss, a reserve judge and former prosecutor in Milwaukee County, had been tapped to hear hear Dugan's cases.\n\nCan Dugan be removed from her role as a circuit court judge?\n\nWisconsin Republican lawmakers signaled they may act to remove Dugan if the obstruction charges against her are \"confirmed.\"\n\nLawmakers can remove sitting judges through an impeachment proceeding beginning in the Assembly, or a process known as removal by address.\n\nHow have Wisconsin officials responded to Dugan's arrest?\n\nDozens of Wisconsin lawmakers have commented on Dugan's arrest. Several Republican lawmakers have voiced their support for the arrest; many Democratic officials stated that Dugan's arrest is an intimidation tactic aimed to place pressure on attorneys and judges who do not express bold support for the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nWisconsin state Sen. Chris Larson wrote in an X post that \"the arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan was announced by FBI Director Kash Patel's on social media is indicative of the true goal of this action – to intimidate other judges into complying with this admin’s authoritarian goals.\"\n\nFormer Republican Gov.

Tony Evers\n\n“In this country, people who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing are innocent until their guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt and they are found guilty by a jury of their peers—this is the fundamental demand of justice in America.“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor.“I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson\n\nThe state's top Republican said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin\n\n“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons. The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power.\n\n\"Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country, and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Tom Tiffany\n\nTiffany, who is considering a run for governor as a Republican in 2026, wrote on X: \"If you help illegal aliens evade arrest, you will be arrested.\"\n\nTiffany attacked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for a memo sent earlier this week to state employees that provided instructions on how to interact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities who visit state buildings. State employees, Tiffany said, should now \"think twice\" before following such guidance.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tony Wied\n\nWied, who represents the state's 8th Congressional District, responded to the news of Dugan's arrest by saying she should \"resign immediately.\"\n\n\"Not only are activist judges trying to thwart the President's agenda, now they are actively breaking the law to protect illegal aliens,\" Wied said.\n\nState Democratic Rep. Ryan Clancy\n\n“We’ve never seen anything remotely like this before. All she did is what we should all be doing: standing up for folks when they need it.”\n\nState Democratic Rep. Christine Sinicki\n\nSinicki stood with protestors on the courthouse steps and told reporters she believes Dugan did the right thing. \"This is clear intimidation,\" Sinicki said. \"If they can walk into a courthouse and arrest a sitting judge, then what can happen to the rest of us? People are scared.\"\n\nState Democratic Rep. Robyn Vining\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about what appears to be the undermining of the independent judiciary, the eroding of the right to due process, and the fear that is tearing through our communities,\" Vining said.\n\n\"Our communities are less safe when courthouses are feared, when witnesses are afraid to testify, and when victims are scared to attend the very hearings that are meant to ensure them justice.\"\n\nFEDERAL OFFICIALS\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel\n\nPatel posted, deleted and then reposted different tweets about the arrest.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi\n\nMILWAUKEE POLITICIANS\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\n\"Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process. We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.\"\n\nAt a press conference later in the day, Crowley called the arrest “a direct attack” on the system of checks and balances and separation of powers. He also called the large law enforcement presence “performative.”\n\n“It is clear the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose these attacks on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” Crowley said adding his office is continuing to have discussions with law enforcement and other agencies about the case. “We are talking about a sitting judge who deserves the same level of due process just like anyone else in our country.”\n\nMilwaukee County Board Supervisor Jack Eckblad\n\n“To be clear: by depriving one person of their right to due process, the federal government is asserting it has the authority to deprive anyone and everyone of those same rights. Judge Dugan’s example is a testament to our ability to insist on our rights, and history will see her as a champion of our democracy. Judge Dugan should be released immediately.”\n\nMilwaukee County Supervisor Shawn Rolland\n\nRolland called the episode \"unprecedented\" and \"deeply concerning,\" and pushed for court proceedings to shift to virtual.\n\nDoing so would eliminate the collision points between ICE and our courthouse, while also saving millions of dollars in costs spent each year on bailiffs and overtime.\n\n“This arrest demonstrates the danger that ICE actions in public spaces create,\" Rolland said in a statement. \"Do we want to live in a country where the FBI is targeting and arresting our teachers, judges, public servants and our neighbors?\n\n“Her arrest by the FBI is an extreme escalation meant to intimidate and silence millions of Americans who believe in a more sensible, strategic and humane immigration policy. We will not be silenced. We will continue to stand for due process, for the Constitution, and for the long-term best interests of America, our economy and our people — both documented and undocumented.”\n\nMilwaukee County Board's Latino caucus\n\n“A federal arrest of a local judge is incredibly serious,\" said County Board Chairwoman Marcelia Nicholson. “It sends a chilling message to community members and leaders looking to do the right thing. Just yesterday, the board stood united, with 17 of 18 supervisors endorsing our resolution on public safety and access to the courthouse for all community members.\"\n\n“As courthouse events continue to unfold, we are reminded why due process is vital in the pursuit of justice,\" said Supervisor Caroline Gómez-Tom. “The broader implications of this administration that continues to devalue our justice system, instill a sense of fear and distrust within our community, many of whom are just seeking access to the Courthouse’s essential services. As I’ve known Judge Dugan, she has been a pillar of justice, standing for upholding the rule of law and the Constitution.”\n\n“The people will not stand for an administration that continues to weaponize our justice system as a means to intimidate immigrant communities, made clear by the cumulative actions over recent weeks,” said Supervisor Juan Miguel Martinez. “Our resolve to uphold due process, justice for all, and real community safety remains strong, as proven yesterday with the passing of our resolution.”\n\nMilwaukee Alderwoman Marina Dimitrijevic\n\nCouncil members Dimitrijevic and JoCasta Zamparripa joined protesters outside the courthouse, saying the judge's arrest was a signal from the federal government to immigrants in Milwaukee.\n\n\"This is not normal, this is not OK,\" Dimitrijevic said, urging local and state leaders to stand with immigrants who are afraid. \"Everyone is welcome in the city of Milwaukee at all times.\"\n\nWISCONSIN POLITICIANS\n\nFormer Republican Gov. Scott Walker\n\n\"The Members of the Wisconsin Legislature should vote to remove disgraced Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan from office,\" Walker said in one of a series of posts on X.\n\n\"It requires a two-thirds vote. They should come in for an extraordinary session ASAP and remove her from office.\"\n\nMILWAUKEE LAWYERS AND ATTORNEYS\n\nDefense attorney, former federal prosecutor Frank Gimbel\n\n“First and foremost, I know — as a former federal prosecutor and as a defense lawyer for decades – that a person who is a judge, who has a residence who has no problem being found, should not be arrested, if you will, like some common criminal,” Gimbel said. “And I'm shocked and surprised that the US Attorney's office or the FBI would not have invited her to show up and accept process if they're going to charge her with a crime.”\n\nHe said that typically someone who is “not on the run,” and facing this type of crime would be called and invited to come in to have their fingerprints taken or to schedule a court appearance.\n\nHe said law enforcement showing up to arrest her, “very, very outrageous, in my opinion and not professional.”\n\nAttorney and former federal prosecutor Stephen Kravit\n\nKravit said the federal government’s arrest of Dugan has “purposely … messed up the entire system.”\n\n“They’ll basically ruin Hannah Dugan’s life and sacrifice her on the altar for the policy that this administration wants to do,” he said. “I think the U.S. attorney’s office should be ashamed that they issued this process.”\n\nCriminal defense attorney Raymond Dall’Osto\n\nDall’Osto, who has practiced in Milwaukee County courts for many years, described the case against Dugan as a “political prosecution.” Instructing someone to go out of a side door isn’t anything “nefarious,\" he said.\n\nAt times, Dall’Osto had his clients exit through a side door as well.\n\n“Judge Dugan should never have been arrested or charged in the first place.

Judge Hannah Dugan's arrest was followed by a brief federal court hearing on federal charges of obstruction and concealing an individual for her role in allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week.\n\nHer arrest at the courthouse was criticized by some in the legal community, including former federal prosecutor and longtime defense attorney Franklyn Gimbel. Dugan's attorney, Craig Mastantuono, told the court during the hearing: \"Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.\"\n\nThe FBI Director posted and later deleted a post on the social media platform X announcing the arrest. U.S. Attorney Pam Bondi didn't delete her post on X confirming Dugan's arrest, summarizing the Justice Department's position that the arrest and charges against the judge came \"for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid arrest by @ICEgov.\"\n\nPlease share your thoughts on this case. We'll post comments as they start rolling in.\n\nJim Fitzhenry is the Ideas Lab Editor/Director of Community Engagement for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Reach him at jfitzhen@gannett.com or 920-993-7154.\n\nCorrection, April 28, 2025: Judge Hannah Dugan faces two federal charges: obstruction of a federal agency, which is a felony; and concealing a person to help them avoid arrest, a misdemeanor. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described one of the counts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/25"}]}

Crow could draw on smash hits from \"Leaving Las Vegas\" to \"All I Wanna Do,\" \"Everyday is a Winding Road\" to \"My Favorite Mistake,\" \"Anything But Down\" to \"Soak Up the Sun\" — and still have signature songs left over.\n\nIt's probably too much to wish for deeper album cuts such as \"The Difficult Kind,\" but a fan can dream.\n\nDo we know who will induct Sheryl Crow?\n\nThe short answer: No.\n\nHowever, the Hall announced that the following artists will either pay tribute to or perform with this year's class: Elton John, Brandi Carlile, Dave Matthews, Chris Stapleton, H.E.R., St. Vincent, New Edition. One could give the speech preceding Crow's induction, but that information — as well as who plays with who — has been kept close to the vest.\n\nAs far as Crow goes, the possibilities are numerous. Carlile helped induct Crow into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame last year; among their several collaborations and crossovers, Carlile has covered Crow's songs in concert and Crow has appeared with Carlile's all-star band The Highwomen.\n\nStapleton co-wrote two songs and sang on \"Tell Me When It's Over\" from Crow's 2019 album \"Threads.\"\n\nAlso on \"Threads\": Crow and Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent) dueted on \"Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" and Carlile showed up, along with Eric Clapton and Sting, on a track.\n\nCrow made a cameo in Dave Matthews Band's video for the 2001 song \"Everyday.\"\n\nWhat are Sheryl Crow's connections to Columbia, Missouri?\n\nBefore setting out on her hall of fame career, Crow was a music education student at MU, graduating in 1984. She made a triumphant return, playing the very definition of a crowd-pleasing set, at the 2021 Roots N Blues festival.\n\nCrow's alma mater honored her on multiple fronts last year, renaming their choral room Sheryl Crow Hall and treating a national audience to Crow's music during Marching Mizzou's appearance at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.\n\nAarik Danielsen is the features and culture editor for the Tribune.

Blige, Ozzy Osbourne and Dave Matthews Band.\n\nAwards for musical excellence were also bestowed to Dionne Warwick, MC5, Norman Whitfield and, posthumously, Jimmy Buffett, while the musical influence award went to a trio of blues heroes, Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton.\n\nYou can replay the full ceremony now on Disney+, or wait for a three-hour broadcast special that airs on ABC Jan. 1 with a replay on Hulu and Disney+ starting Jan. 2.\n\nHere is a roundup of the performances – including a tribute to Buffett from James Taylor and Kenny Chesney, a surprise from Foreigner and a searing homage to a clearly delighted Osbourne – from this year’s Rock Hall induction ceremony.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCher: ‘Believe,’ ‘If I Could Turn Back Time’\n\nOf all the megawattage in this year’s Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction class, none could out-wattage Cher.\n\nBut before the hair-tossing legend arrived, one of her many pupils, the lissome Dua Lipa, worked from Cher’s blueprint of commanding and sexy.\n\nIn a thigh-and-butt-baring outfit, her hair blackened to match her ensemble, Lipa pumped though “Believe,” Cher’s vocoder-tinged comeback from the dustbin in 1998, proving, for the 12 millionth time, that one should never, ever, for any reason, diminish the power of Cher.\n\nThat unrivaled magnetism was instantly apparent the second Cher, 78, appeared during the bridge of the song, her husky timbre overtaking a reverent Lipa, with whom she matched in her own black peekaboo outfit.\n\nAfter accepting her award with a typically unfiltered speech – “It was easier getting divorced from two men than getting into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” she quipped – Cher headed back to the performance stage. The Roots backed her and audience member Jelly Roll smiled uncontrollably as Cher strutted and stalked the stage with her enduring anthem, “If I Could Turn Back Time,” complete with a fiery solo from guitarist Joel Hoekstra.\n\n“The one thing I have never done, I never give up,\" Cher said during her speech. \"I’m talking to the women. We’ve been down and out and we keep striving and we keep going. We are somebody. We are special.”\n\nNo argument here.\n\nKool & The Gang: Medley\n\nIt took 30 years from their point of eligibility for the brilliant soul-pop of Kool & The Gang to be recognized. A few notes of the bass line of “Hollywood Swinging” from Robert “Kool” Bell and the brass bleats that power the 1974 song immediately reminded of the potency of the group’s songs aside from the wedding reception tripe “Celebration.”\n\nJames “J.T.” Taylor, the voice who joined in 1979 and coated “Get Down on It” and “Ladies Night” with his smooth pipes, joined Bell (with The Roots helping to lay down the groove) for a medley. Even Dave Matthews was dancing in the crowd as a giant disco ball spun on the video screen behind the band during “Ladies Night” before the stage bled red for the thick funk of “Jungle Boogie.”\n\nOf course “Celebration” ended the performance, an obvious closer we’ll allow simply because it fit the occasion and gave the confetti cannon operator something to do early in the show.\n\nDionne Warwick: ‘I Know I’ll Never Love This Way Again,’ ‘Walk on By’\n\nClad in a black sequined pantsuit in honor of Warwick’s chic 1970s style, the power-lunged Jennifer Hudson injected the 1979 soul anthem (produced by Barry Manilow) with her usual intensity. But after the first verse, she stepped aside to salute Warwick, who entered from the back of the stage wearing her own sequined pantsuit and a gleaming smile.\n\nWarwick and Hudson weren’t always in key as they launched into massive notes. But Warwick offered a masterclass in phrasing, particularly during her solo spin on “Walk on By,” on which she demonstrated the control she still has of her instrument.\n\n“They finally got it right,” Warwick said at the start of her induction speech, acknowledging her two previous nominations with a pointed observation in that tone that is distinctly Dionne.\n\nForeigner: Medley\n\nNo original member of Foreigner has played in the band since last year, when founding member Mick Jones stepped away because of the effects of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nSo it was no surprise to see Slash, Red Hot Chili Peppers stickman Chad Smith and Demi Lovato belt through “Feels Like the First Time.” Lovato possesses the rock grit to convincingly sell the song, while Sammy Hagar – who introduced the band with a charmingly ramshackle speech – added his own brawny vocal to “Hot Blooded.”\n\nSlash aped Jones’ monster riffs of the song and Hagar graciously shared the mic with Kelly Hansen, the band’s singer since 2005.\n\nIt also wasn’t surprising when Hagar said, “Now the real singer is coming out,” and a pristine-sounding Kelly Clarkson launched into the gospel beauty of “I Want To Know What Love Is,” her eyes closed with passion, her nuanced voice climbing the scales alongside a choir.\n\nBut it was a shock when Clarkson introduced Lou Gramm, the original muscular voice of the band and co-founder with Jones.\n\nGramm, who was in and out of Foreigner since 1990 before leaving for good in 2003, eased into the song, his familiar voice growing stronger as he traded verses with a respectful Clarkson.\n\nIn a dark suit, his hair straight to his shoulders, Gramm looked pleased as he closed the song and shared a hug with Clarkson.\n\nPeter Frampton: ‘Baby (Something’s Happening)’, ‘Do You Feel Like We Do’\n\nDespite producing a plethora of rock hits in the 1970s, Frampton opted to open his performance with the lesser-known title track of his 1974 album, “Baby (Somethin’s Happening)”. Seated with his guitar, a joyful-looking Frampton, who played at last year’s ceremony with Sheryl Crow, welcomed Keith Urban to share the moment.\n\nFrampton has suffered from the muscle-weakening inclusion body myositis since 2015. The disease has affected his legs and mobility, but not as much his hands, which ignited his fretboard with the slithering notes of his 1973 opus “Do You Feel Like We Do.”\n\nFrampton and Urban, both guitar aces, made their finger-splaying notes look effortless and (hopefully) inspired some young viewers to pick up an instrument.\n\nThe loudest cheers, however, were reserved for Frampton’s signature talk box. That is, until he practically played himself out of his seat while riffing on the song’s solo as Urban, floppy bangs flying, happily kept pace.\n\n“Now that’s a rock star!” proclaimed inductor Roger Daltrey at song’s end. Indeed.\n\nDave Matthews, James Taylor, Kenny Chesney: Jimmy Buffett tribute\n\nAn admittedly nervous Matthews graced the stage solo with an acoustic guitar, his emotion visible as he scrunched his eyes closed and sang Buffett’s contemplative “A Pirate Looks at Forty.” Matthews’ voice swung from gravelly to hushed in a simple, affecting tribute.\n\nAnother Buffett buddy, James Taylor, eulogized the irreplaceable musician, who died in September 2023, and then moved to the performance stage, flanked by Kenny Chesney and renowned session guitarist/producer Mac McAnally, also a longtime member of Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band.\n\nThe trio was visibly filled with emotion as they traded verses on “Come Monday,” harmonizing on the last line with a heavenly lilt directed at Buffett.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest: Guest medley\n\nWith The Roots laying down the beat after an agonizingly lengthy induction speech from ATCQ’s Q-Tip, Queen Latifah glided onto the stage asking hip-hop's enduring question, “Can I Kick It?”\n\nA starry parade honored the confab from Queens, New York, including Roots co-founder Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter during a taut “Check the Rhime.”\n\nCommon popped on stage to side dance and unroll the beckoning lyrics of “Bonita Applebum” with the kind of verve that had Dionne Warwick standing and clapping along to the gliding track, which bumped to a harsher level with the arrival of Busta Rhymes.\n\nThe swaggering Busta, all flailing arms and rubber faces, segued with The Roots into “Scenario,” the song that introduced Busta to the rap scene in 1992.\n\nMary J. Blige: Medley\n\nIn thigh-high black boots and matching elbow-length gloves, a wide brimmed hat nearly obscuring her face but not her cinnamon-hued hair, Blige reinstated her position as the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.\n\nYoung R&B singers Ella Mai and Lucky Daye joined Blige as she floated through her recent musical affirmation “Good Morning Gorgeous” and, from her 1992 debut album “What’s the 411?,” “Love No Limit.”\n\nJennifer Hudson mouthed along to “Be Happy” in the crowd while Blige swayed on stage, punctuating the air with her hands.\n\nThe highlight of Blige’s performance came with the snaking thump of “Family Affair,” Blige’s voice growing more urgent as plumes of steam erupted around her, a fitting finale for a queen.\n\nOzzy Osbourne: Guest medley\n\nFrom his throne onstage, the inimitable Osbourne bellowed the hallowed opening of “Crazy Train”: “All aboard!!!”\n\nChad Smith, back for another round behind the drums, bulldozed into the song as Tool’s Maynard James Keenan, in a chic black suit, handled the gritty vocals. If you want someone to play Randy Rhoads’ iconic riffs from Osbourne’s 1980 cruncher, you want Wolfgang Van Halen, whose finger-bleeding solo inspired chills. Guitarist/producer Andrew Watt and Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo rounded out the all-star crew.\n\nLongtime Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde played the sweet acoustic guitar that introduced “Mama I’m Coming Home” followed by a well-cast Jelly Roll pouring his versatile voice and usual pathos into the rich rock ballad.\n\nWylde stepped into the crowd to sizzle through the launch of “No More Tears” as a well-preserved Billy Idol sneered the lyrics alongside his longtime musical partner Steve Stevens on guitar. As they unleashed the thumping song, Osbourne, with fervent fan and inductor Jack Black seated next to him, sang along heartily, the Prince of Darkness still enlivened by his own songs.\n\nDave Matthews Band: Medley\n\nIn 2019, the Dave Matthews Band became the first artist to win the fan vote but not get voted in for induction.\n\nThis year, the outcome was different.\n\nWinners of the 2024 fan vote, DMB demonstrated their value from the signature snare drum smack that ushers in “Ants Marching.” With his guitar held high and against his chest, his eyebrows cocked in that way that could be quizzical or menacing depending upon the setting, Matthews unleashed his quirky vocals.\n\nHis unusual phrasing during “Crash Into Me” is part of the song’s charm – as well as his undiminished upper range, which dipped from soaring to squeaky – while the throwback “So Much to Say” provided a reminiscence to the band’s early days playing Virginia bars.\n\nCarter Beauford, perhaps the most unheralded drummer in music, busied himself with syncopated patterns and dizzying high hat on the song.\n\nBut DMB had one more burst to play a surely exhausted audience out of the arena – the band’s rugged cover of the Talking Heads’ “Burning Down the House.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/20"}]}

Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”\n\n“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/23/justin-trudeau-canada-liberals-reelection/77178139007/", "title": "When is Trudeau up for reelection?

The Globe and Mail, citing a Liberal source, said he would spend Christmas with family before taking a skiing vacation in the Pacific province of British Columbia.\n\nA Liberal source told Reuters last week that Trudeau would mull his future over the Christmas and New Year.\n\nOpposition parties say that given Trudeau's days are clearly numbered, and the incoming U.S. administration is promising to impose a crippling 25% tariff on all Canadian imports, the country needs an election now to produce a stable government.\n\nPolls show the Liberals would be crushed by the official opposition right-of-center Conservatives in an election.\n\nThe Liberal Party released an advert over the weekend saying that if the Conservatives won, they would slash public spending. The spot did not mention Trudeau once.\n\nTrudeau's options include staying on until a near-certain defeat in a no-confidence motion, probably in March, stepping down next month to allow the party to name an interim leader, or ending the current session of parliament to buy the Liberals some time to choose a new leader and prepare for the next election, though that risked alienating voters.\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Tomasz Janowski)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/europe/italy-election-results-intl/index.html", "title": "Italy election 2022: Giorgia Meloni claims victory to become Italy's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in a general election that seems set to install her as Italy’s first female prime minister, leading the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini.\n\nAddressing the media and supporters in the early hours of Monday morning, Meloni said it was “a night of pride for many and a night of redemption.”\n\n“It’s a victory I want to dedicate to everyone who is no longer with us and wanted this night,” she said. “Starting tomorrow we have to show our value … Italians chose us, and we will not betray it, as we never have,” she said.\n\nPreliminary results put an alliance of far-right parties, led by Meloni’s ultraconservative Brothers of Italy party, on track to win at least 44% of the vote, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.\n\nWith 63% of votes counted, the Brothers of Italy party had won at least 26%, with coalition partners the League, led by Matteo Salvini, taking around 9% and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia scoring over 8%.

Whereas Berlusconi and Salvini have both said they would like to review sanctions against Russia because of their impact on the Italian economy, Meloni has been steadfast in her support for defending Ukraine.\n\nA 45-year-old mother from Rome, Meloni is deeply conservative, openly anti-LBGT, and has threatened to place same-sex unions, which were legalized in Italy in 2016, under review. She has also called abortion a “tragedy,” raising fears for the future of women’s rights in the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister 02:57 - Source: CNN Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister 02:57\n\n‘A sad evening’\n\nThe preliminary results showed the center-left coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic Party and centrist party +Europe had won around 22% of the vote, while former prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s bid to revive the Five Star Movement appeared to have been unsuccessful, with around 15%.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Conte promised to lead an “uncompromising opposition.”\n\n“We will be the outpost for the progressive agenda against inequalities, to protect families and businesses in difficulty, to defend the rights and values of our Constitution.”\n\nDebora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party also conceded defeat early Monday morning, calling the results a “sad evening for the country.”\n\n“Undoubtedly we cannot, in light of the data seen so far, not attribute the victory to the right dragged by Giorgia Meloni. It is a sad evening for the country,” Serracchiani told reporters.\n\nSunday’s snap national election was triggered by party infighting that saw the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.\n\nVoters headed to the polls amid a number of new regulations, with voting hours also contained to one day rather than two.\n\nOther changes included a younger voting age for the Senate and a reduction in the number of seats to elect – down from 685 seats to 400 in the Senate and from 315 to 200 in the lower House of Parliament. That parliament is scheduled to meet on October 13, at which point the head of state will call on party leaders to decide on the shape of the new government.\n\nThe buildup to the election was dominated by hot-button issues including Italy’s cost-of-living crisis, a 209 billion euro ($200 billion) package from the European Covid-19 recovery fund and the country’s support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incoming prime minister – the sixth in just eight years – will be tasked with tackling a number of challenges, with soaring energy costs and economic uncertainty among the country’s most pressing.\n\nAnd while Meloni is slated to make history as Italy’s first female prime minister, her politics do not mean that she is necessarily interested in advancing women’s rights.\n\nEmiliana De Blasio, adviser for diversity and inclusion at LUISS University in Rome, told CNN Meloni is “not raising up at all questions on women’s rights and empowerment in general.”\n\nThe Italian results come as other far-right parties in other European countries have marked recent gains. That includes Sweden’s anti-immigration party, Sweden Democrats – a party with neo-Nazi roots – which is expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month.\n\nAnd in France, while far-right ideologue Marine Le Pen lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in April, her share of the popular vote shifted France’s political center dramatically to the right.\n\nAlthough Macron and Meloni ideologically diverge, the French president said Monday that France respects Italy’s decision to elect a government headed by Meloni.\n\nSince former German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in December, Macron has increasingly emerged as the top EU leader – a position that would put him at odds with the Euroskepticism expressed by the Brothers of Italy.\n\n“The Italian people have made a democratic and sovereign choice. We respect it,” Macron said, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\n“As a neighbor and friend, we must continue to work together. It’s as Europeans that we will succeed in overcoming our joint challenges,” he added.\n\nIn a social media post early Monday, Meloni dedicated her projected win to “all the militants, managers, supporters and every single person who – in these years – has contributed to the realization of our dream, offering soul and heart spontaneously and selflessly.”\n\nShe added: “We won’t betray your trust. We are ready to lift Italy up.”", "authors": ["Kara Fox Barbie Latza Nadeau Antonia Mortensen Nicola Ruotolo Sharon Braithwaite Valentina Didonato", "Kara Fox", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Antonia Mortensen", "Nicola Ruotolo", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Valentina Didonato"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/06/congress-certify-jan-6-donald-trump/77242723007/", "title": "Congress certifies Trump's 2024 victory on Jan. 6: Recap", "text": "WASHINGTON − Congress certified Donald Trump's 2024 election victory on Monday in a civil proceeding, four years after the president-elect's supporters rioted and attacked the Capitol building in a deadly insurrection.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris presided over the counting of the electoral votes in the House chambers, leading the certification of the election she lost to Trump.\n\nWith the nation's capital carpeted in snow and the Capitol grounds ringed in security fencing, Trump was certified the 2024 winner without a single objection. In a 40-minute ceremony, each state's votes were tallied, and lawmakers cheered for their delegations.\n\nBut members of Congress also reflected on the four years since the Capitol riot. On Jan. 6, 2021, a group of the president-elect's supporters, driven by false claims of election fraud, stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to block President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nDemocrats have a symbolic moment\n\nDemocratic leaders and the House chaplain, Margaret Grun Kibben, are at the site where Capitol rioters first breached the building in 2021. The chaplain opened with a prayer.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was less than 20 feet from rioters as he was ferried out of the Senate chamber that day.\n\n“We must never forget,” Schumer said. “Democracy is both sacred, its roots are deep, but at times it can be fragile.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Jan. 6, 2021 was “a day that will live in infamy.”\n\n“Hopefully today the peaceful transfer of power should serve as an example of how we as a country should move forward,” Jeffries said.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nDemocratic caucus stays unusually quiet with zero objections\n\nJan. 6, 2025, marked the first time that not a single congressional Democrat objected to certifying a Republican president-elect since 1988.\n\nDemocrats objected 11 times in 2017 when lawmakers were gathered to certify Trump's first presidential win. And 31 House Democrats in 2005 opposed certifying former President George W. Bush's reelection victory in Ohio, citing voting issues in the state.\n\nIn spite of these interruptions, electoral certification had been a traditionally routine process that garnered little attention from average Americans outside Washington before four years ago.\n\nIn 2021, 147 House and Senate Republicans opposed certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 win, shortly before a group of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent attempted insurrection.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris speaks after overseeing electoral vote count\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president in the 2024 election, oversaw the electoral vote count in her role as president of the Senate.\n\nToday was about \"a peaceful transfer of power,\" she told reporters following the ceremony.\n\n\"Today, I did what I have done my entire career, which is take seriously the oath that I have taken many times to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" she said, \"which included today, performing my constitutional duty to ensure that the people of America, the voters of America, will have their votes counted, that those votes matter, and that they will determine then with the outcome of an election.\"\n\nShe did not take questions from reporters.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\n'Particularly admirable': Mike Pence praises Kamala Harris for Jan. 6 duties\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was “particularly admirable” that Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the certification of Trump’s 2024 presidential victory.\n\n“The peaceful transfer of power is the hallmark of our democracy and today, members of both parties in the House and Senate along with the vice president certified the election of our new president and vice president without controversy or objection,” he said.\n\n“I also commend the members of the House, Senate and the Vice President who did their duty under the Constitution of the United States, it being particularly admirable that Vice President Harris would preside over the certification of a presidential election that she lost,” he later added in the post.\n\nTrump in 2021 urged Pence to reject President Joe Biden’s electoral votes as Pence oversaw the certification of the 2020 election. However, Pence insisted that he never had that authority, even as rioters threatened his life, saying at the time that there’s “almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'Absolute horror'\n\nWhen Maxwell Goddard, 29, woke up four years on Jan. 6, he didn't expect rioters would succeed in breaching the Capitol building.\n\n\"I watched that day as it unfolded in absolute horror,\" said Goddard outside the building four years later. Standing in front of a tall fence wearing a light jacket in the snow, Goddard held a sign reading \"14th Amendment Section 3.\"\n\nThe amendment states that officials are disqualified from holding office if they have \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the U.S. government.\n\nGoddard flew all the way from his home in Merrimack, New Hampshire, to demonstrate in front of the Capitol. He was one of few demonstrators on the street packed with police.\n\n\"I've somewhat spent the past four years of my life trying to understand what actually went on here,\" he said. \"I just don't know what else to do, except I got a flight down here and made this little sign.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nJD Vance jokes with Marjorie Taylor Greene after ceremony\n\nJD Vance, who is still a member of the Senate and will serve there until he's sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20, greeted supporters at the Capitol on Monday. He was seen joking with his fellow Republicans after the certification, including Trump loyalist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nPointing to her red MAGA hat, Vance said he bought his mother-in-law, Lakshmi Chilukuri, a MAGA hat for Christmas. The gifted hat was autographed by Trump and at least double in size a typical cap.\n\n“She makes you look like a Democrat,” Vance told Greene, eliciting laughter.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nJan. 6 proceedings were swift in 2025\n\nMonday’s ceremony only took around 30 minutes. No lawmakers objected, and the proceedings went smoothly.\n\nIn comparison, the same ceremony took hours four years ago.\n\nLawmakers initially met at the same time, 1 p.m. But just a few minutes later, lawmakers objected to the results in Arizona, forcing the chambers to split up and deliberate over the objection.\n\nAround 2 p.m., a mob of Trump’s supporters breached the building, and lawmakers began evacuating. The Capitol complex was finally secured by 8 p.m., and lawmakers came back into session around 9 p.m. However, more Republican lawmakers objected to results in key swing states. Congress finally declared Biden’s victory shortly after 3 a.m. the next day.\n\nIn 2009, it took 36 minutes to name Barack Obama president. In 2013, Obama's reelection was certified in 22 minutes. In 2017, confirmation of Trump's victory lasted 41 minutes.− Riley Beggin and Sarah D. Wire\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene: 'I enjoyed the process'\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., donning a red hat with “MAGA” embroidered in white, said she had a “great time” during the Jan. 6 proceedings.\n\n“I sat by Diana Harshbarger, who was really funny and a lot of fun to talk to. We just certified it, got it done quickly, and so I enjoyed the process,” she said, referencing her fellow Republican representative from Tennessee.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said that there was a “peaceful transfer of power which is what it’s all about.”\n\n“I think we’re ready to serve a new chapter,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican reflects on Trump’s victory\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said she was feeling “very excited” about lawmakers certifying Trump’s victory on Monday.\n\n“The American people have rejected socialism. They've rejected wokeism, and they've chosen president Trump to lead them. So we're very excited to be certifying results today,” she said.\n\nLuna said she doesn’t expect any Democrats to raise objections during the Jan. 6 proceedings.\n\n“They know that Trump won big,” said Luna, who has claimed voter fraud tainted Joe Biden's 2020 election.\n\nTrump received 312 electoral votes while Vice President Kamala Harris received 226 electoral votes in the 2024 presidential race.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nOhio lawmaker watches her first electoral vote count\n\nRep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio., was a state legislator in 2021 during the Capitol riot. She said it was one of the reasons she decided to run for Congress in 2022.\n\n“It’s very surreal to be a member of Congress. It's one of the reasons that I was encouraged to run for Congress to make sure that we could protect our democracy and ensure that peaceful transition of power that allows us to be the beacon of democracy for the entire world,” Sykes, who began her second term on Friday, said.\n\nBefore heading to her office, Sykes said she greeted the police stationed inside the Capitol and thanked them for their service.“I asked them how they are feeling today and thanked them for their service…and hopefully, didn't give them a false promise of we'll do better today,” she said.−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSeveral Democrats missing from chamber\n\nA significant number of House Democrats appear absent from the proceedings.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., urged members to stay in town over the weekend. Republicans also met to plan a policy package they aim to tackle as soon as possible.\n\nBut most Democrats returned home over the weekend. A snow storm blanketing the country may have interrupted many of their flights.\n\nThe Republican side of the chamber is packed, with several House members standing in the back as GOP senators take their typical seats.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nVice President Harris gavels the session into order\n\nAnd electoral vote count and certification of Donald Trump's victory begins.\n\nRepresentatives of the states, in alphabetical order, are reading alout their electoral vote tallies.\n\nVance, Vice President-elect, shares a laugh with Dem senators\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance, R-Ohio, is among the senators attending the ceremony. He is still a U.S. Senator until Jan. 20, when he will be sworn in to his new role.\n\nHe is taking his time walking down the center aisle, pausing to speak with House members including Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\nHe also shared a moment of laughter with several Democratic members.\n\nThe chamber is now coming to order.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\n‘Should be an unremarkable day’: Lawmaker reflects on four years since riot\n\nSen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., went viral four years ago for images of him, then a member of the House, picking up debris left by January 6, 2021, rioters. Four years later to the day, Kim, now a recently elected senator, said he retraced his steps in the halls he helped clean.\n\n“It’s a lot to process,” Kim said. “I don't think I have an adjective that can really encapsulate how I feel right now.”\n\nBefore making his way to the House side with other senators, Kim noted what he said should be a return to normalcy.\n\n“January 6th should be an unremarkable day,” Kim said. “You know, this is a day that the rest of America should never have to really think about it.”\n\n“The fact that it is a day that still lingers in our consciousness just kind of shows just how broken our politics are right now,” he added.−Savannah Kuchar\n\nU.S. Senators enter the House Chamber\n\nThe joint session of Congress is officially coming together to oversee the certification of President-elect Donald Trump's victory.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is the first to enter the chamber from the Senate side. She is the president of the Senate and will oversee today's proceedings.\n\nThe rest of the senators file in behind her. Rep. Madeline Dean, D-Pa., asks Harris for a handshake as she nears the podium and the two clasp hands in a brief moment of recognition.\n\nHarris will have the awkward task of certifying her loss, the first presidential candidate to do so since Al Gore in 2001.\n\n−Riley Beggin and Savannah Kuchar\n\nSchumer readies Democrats to certify results\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., revisited the events of Jan. 6, 2021 in a floor speech Monday. Lawmakers on that day returned to the chamber after a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol and oversaw the counting of Electoral Votes. With the Senate cleared of rioters, some Republicans moved to overturn the results in key swing states, but a majority of their colleagues voted against it.\n\n\"As hard as January 6th was, it will be one of my proudest moments in office. Because on that day the majority of us united to uphold our oaths to the constitution,\" Schumer said.\n\nHe pledged Democrats would not challenge the results this year.\n\n\"We can never again allow this level of unhinged election denialism to happen,\" he said.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nFederal employees take advantage of snow day\n\nThe national mall was empty hours before Congress was set to certify the election, save for a few walkers and a small group engaged in a snowball fight.\n\nThe snow was good news for Sara Ludewig and Casey Hughes, two librarians who took a stroll around the snowy mall on their lunch break. As federal employees, the pair teleworked for the day, and will have Thursday off for former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral.\n\n“I’m from the Midwest, so I like all the winter sports, and it's fun to see that people still do them out here,“ said Ludewig, 29.\n\nThe tall fences around Capitol building also ringed the National Mall. Hughes, 29, said she hadn’t realized that the January 6 riot four years ago was the reason for the extra security.\n\n“Every year when the date rolls around, people get anxious for good reason,” she said. “This year, at least the snow was a nicer way to think about different things.”\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDem knocks Trump before Congress certifies his victory\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted Trump on Monday, saying that he wants to “whitewash” the Capitol riot.\n\n“Four years ago, we watched an insurrection here, and now we are in a position to say, once again, we believe in democracy, and we are handing over power,” Warren told USA TODAY. “Donald Trump wants to whitewash the insurrection that occurred four years ago, but the American people know what they saw with their own eyes.”\n\nWarren said she was disappointed Trump's praise of the Jan. 6 rioters. Trump has called the Jan. 6 defendants “warriors” and politicial prisoners − and has promised pardons for some.\n\n“They're insurrectionists,\" Warren said. \"This is what transfer of power is supposed to look like. The side that wins gets the power, the other side ratifies the election.”\n\nOver a thousand defendants tied to the Capitol riot have been charged.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSnow and silence over U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 anniversary\n\nOn the anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots, silent snow fell over a heavy barricade around the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“Police line: do not cross,” read the signs zip-tied to roughly 8-foot fences blocking off the reflecting pool and the U.S. Capitol beyond it. Police cars with blinking lights surrounded the street.\n\nIn contrast with the thousands rioters who converged on the Capitol building four years earlier, a few passersby walked the street, some stopping to peer through the gates.\n\nA lone bicyclist holding a sign bearing an expletive directed at the president-elect passed slowly up and down the street behind a snow plow. He declined to be interviewed.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhere is Donald Trump today?\n\nAs Congress is set to certify the 2024 presidential election results, President-elect Donald Trump isn’t in Washington D.C. on Monday.\n\nNo details of Trump’s schedule have been released by his team, but the president-elect is currently in West Palm Beach, according to a transition pool report.\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nKamala Harris says she'll certify Trump's win\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said she would perform her constitutional duty and certify the results of the 2024 election in a Monday video, in which she emphasized the importance of protecting America’s democracy.\n\n“As we have seen, our democracy can be fragile. And it is up to each of us to stand up for our most cherished principles,” she said in the message, which she posted to X.\n\nHarris said her decision was “guided by love of country, loyalty to our Constitution, and my unwavering faith in the American people.”\n\n“The peaceful transfer of power is one of the most fundamental principles of American democracy. As much as any other principle, it is what distinguishes our system of government from monarchy or tyranny,” she said.\n\nHarris will become the first presidential candidate since former Vice President Al Gore in 2001 to certify their own electoral loss.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\n‘Do not leave town’: Lawmakers asked to stay in D.C. amid winter storm\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday urged lawmakers to stay in Washington D.C. amid the winter storm that hit the nation's capital early Monday morning.\n\n\"I hope we have full attendance,” Johnson said during an interview with Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.” “We have got a big snowstorm coming to D.C. and we encouraged all of our colleagues: do not leave town, stay here.”\n\nThe Electoral Count Act requires Congress to certify presidential results on January 6 at 1 p.m., Johnson said.\n\n“Whether we're in a blizzard or not, we are going to be in that chamber making sure this is done,” Johnson said. “President Trump had a mandate, a landslide…we cannot delay that certification. He deserves that.”\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nA bat in the corner: Lawmakers hope for smooth proceedings\n\nFor the last four years, there's been a baseball bat propped up in a corner of Elissa Slotkin's office.\n\nThe Democrat from Michigan bought it after Jan. 6, 2021, when she found herself barricaded inside that office as a frenzied mob of Donald Trump's supporters roamed the U.S. Capitol after overwhelming police. Slotkin, a former House member who began her first term as a U.S. senator on Friday, recalled rushing into her office and frantically looking around for a weapon to defend herself and others.\n\n\"It's a day that is seared on my memory,\" she told USA TODAY. \"It was an extremely dark stain on our country's history.\"\n\nUnlike Jan. 6, 2021, lawmakers say they expect Jan. 6, 2025, to be uneventful. \"Jan. 6 is going to be nice and calm,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, an avid supporter of the president-elect.\n\n−Riley Beggin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAccused in Jan. 6 riot, hoping to view Trump's inauguration\n\nAs he fights multiple felony charges for allegedly assaulting police on Jan. 6, 2021, Tommy Tatum of Mississippi had hoped to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration later this month.\n\nProsecutors resisted, arguing Tatum could end up face-to-face with the officers he's accused of attacking.\n\nA federal judge agreed in one of several recent rulings by judges barring Jan. 6 defendants from participating in events celebrating Trump’s return to office.\n\n“Tatum’s alleged conduct was particularly violent,” U.S. District Judge John Bates wrote of the need to restrict his travel to the nation’s capital while he’s awaiting trial.\n\nThe nearly 1,600 people charged with crimes related to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol are counting on Trump to fulfill his promise to pardon at least some of them.\n\nIn the meantime, some have had mixed success in getting judges to let them attend Trump’s inauguration.\n\n−Maureen Groppe and Bart Jansen\n\nAs Trump awaits certification in DC, reports say Justin Trudeau may resign in Canada\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation amid increasing pressure from the nation's lawmakers for him to step down, according to reports.\n\nTrudeau is expected to announce as early as Monday that he would quit as leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party after nine years in office, sources first told the Globe and Mail. A source close to Trudeau told Reuters on Sunday the prime minister was likely to announce plans to step down, but had not made a final decision.\n\nThe telegenic son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is under pressure to step down ahead of an anticipated election wipeout for the Liberals. Trudeau has had an often antagonistic relationship with Trump. Trump has promised to impose hefy tariffs on Canada and Mexico once he takes office.\n\n−Eric Lagatta\n\nJan. 6 is traditionally a brief, no-drama ceremony\n\nOne way of recalling the events of 2021 might be to compare what took place on that astonishing January day with the brief, orderly formalities Americans can expect at the Capitol on Monday.\n\nCertifying the Electoral College's vote is a perfunctory ceremony.\n\nOn Monday, the House and Senate will meet jointly. Vice President Kamala Harris will preside.\n\nThe chambers will appoint members as \"tellers\" to count the votes, weigh any objections − and then formally announce who won.\n\nIn 2009, it took 36 minutes to name Barack Obama president. In 2013, Obama's reelection was certified in 22 minutes. In 2017, confirmation of Trump's victory lasted 41 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, when a mob violently took control of the Capitol complex, it took 14 hours and 48 minutes to name Joe Biden the winner.\n\n−Sarah D.

No rioters storming the Capitol. No one pushing past police barricades and beating officers with makeshift weapons. No lawmakers running through the Capitol’s corridors in fear of their lives. No sitting president pressuring a vice president to thwart the process.\n\n“I think it will almost be a nonevent,” predicted Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.\n\n−Michael Collins, Bart Jansen and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat happens on Jan. 6?\n\nThe House and Senate will convene to count the Electoral College votes from coast to coast and declare the winner of the presidential election.\n\nSince the Capitol riot, Congress has passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results, a much higher bar than existed before when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.\n\n– Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez and Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nWhen does Trump take office?\n\nThe inauguration ceremony will be held on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025 at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C.\n\nAround noon on Inauguration Day, the president-elect recites the following oath in accordance with Article II, Section I of the U.S. Constitution:\n\n\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n– Victoria E.

Jake LaTurner, R-KS announced he would not seek reelection in April.The leading GOP candidates in a solidly conservative seat are former state attorney general Derek Schmidt, former LaTurner aide Jeff Kahrs, rancher Shawn Tiffany, veteran Michael Ogle, and Chad Young.

Mike Rogers against ex-Congressman Justin Amash and physician Sherry O’Donnell, a former congressional candidate.\n\nMichigan: U.S. House races\n\nDemocrats currently hold the majority of Michigan’s congressional delegation, 7-6, but seats are up for grabs in several districts that could decide control of the U.S. House.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Republicans Paul Hudson and Michael Markey are running for the chance to challenge incumbent Democratic first-term U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who has her own primary challenger in Salim Al-Shatel but is favored to win.\n\nIn the 8th District, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., is stepping down from Congress this year after six terms. Three Democrats and three Republicans are running in their respective primaries.\n\nIn the 10th District, Democrat Carl Marlinga, Emily Busch, Tiffany Tilley, and Diane Young are vying for the Democratic nomination against Republican Rep. John James. James barely beat out Marlinga in this race two years ago.\n\nMissouri: U.S. House seats\n\nDemocratic incumbent Rep. Cori Bush is expected to have a run for her money against St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell in the party’s primary for Missouri’s 1st District.\n\nBell, who has backing from pro-Israel groups, is attacking Bush, who is being framed as a partisan disruption to Democratic cooperation in the House. A member of “The Squad” made up of progressive congressional Democrats, if Bush falls short of votes, she would be the second ouster following New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s stunning upset in June.\n\nTwo other Democrats, Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Ron Harshaw, will also appear on the Democratic ballot. Five candidates are on the Republican primary ballot.\n\nWashington\n\nLeft-leaning Washington state will see contested primaries for its fifth and sixth congressional districts as the current representatives in each, GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Democrat Rep. Derek Kilmer, respectively, are retiring.\n\nIn the 8th District, centrist Democrat Rep. Kim Schrier faces disruption from a new candidate focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Meanwhile, in the 3rd District, Trump-endorsed Joe Kent is looking to unseat Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in what appears to be a tightly contested race.\n\nWashington has a nonpartisan primary system in which all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and the top two finishers in the race advance to the general election.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nTwo years ago, Democrat Gluesenkamp Perez pulled off a major upset by winning a congressional seat against Trump-backed candidate Joe Kent in a district that hadn’t voted Democratic in over a decade. Now, with Trump’s endorsement again, Kent is back to reclaim the seat in Washington’s southwest corner. However, he faces strong competition from former King County Prosecutor Leslie Lewallen, who has raised $820,000 compared to Kent’s nearly $1.4 million. Lewallen focuses on crime and homelessness, criticizing both Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent for being too extreme.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez has outpaced her challengers with $6.7 million in fundraising. She supports abortion access and climate change policies while advocating for increased border security to combat the fentanyl crisis. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for President Biden’s impeachment, accuses Gluesenkamp Perez of pretending to be a moderate.\n\n4th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Trump-endorsed Jerrod Sessler and former nurse Tiffany Smiley in Washington’s reddest congressional district, spanning from the Canadian border to the Columbia River. Newhouse, one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, focuses on agriculture and border security, key issues for a district reliant on immigrant labor.\n\nSessler, a Navy veteran and ex-NASCAR driver, proudly embraces Trump’s endorsement, while Smiley criticizes Newhouse’s stance on Trump. Newhouse has raised $1.6 million, outpacing Smiley and Sessler combined.\n\n5th Congressional District\n\nTen candidates are battling to succeed McMorris Rogers, who has served in Congress for two decades, in the Fifth District, a Republican-leaning district encompassing the eastern third of the state and Spokane.\n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats are competing for the top two spots to advance to the November ballot. (A fifth Democrat, Bobbi Bennett-Wolcott, will also appear on the ballot despite dropping out in July.) Republican Spokane Country treasurer and former state Sen. Michael Baumgartner is the race’s top fundraiser, while OBGYN Dr. Bernadine Bank holds a slight lead over the Democratic candidates in campaign contributions.\n\n6th Congressional District\n\nIn Washington's Sixth Congressional District, 5 candidates are vying to replace retiring Rep. Derek Kilmer (D). This includes state senators Emily Randall (D) and Drew MacEwen (R), Washington Public Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz (D), and independent Graham Ralston. Each one brings a different perspective on addressing the district's challenges, including rising living costs, economic development, and healthcare shortages.\n\nFranz, with a strong background in public lands and housing, advocates for increased housing production, support for workers' rights, and enhanced Medicare benefits. Randall emphasizes economic policies that support the middle class, clean energy investments, and expanding healthcare access. MacEwen focuses on reducing government spending, enhancing infrastructure, and addressing healthcare facility closures. Ralston, as an independent, stresses curbing inflation and expanding healthcare infrastructure while leveraging the district's natural beauty to boost the economy.8th Congressional District\n\nU.S. Rep Kim Schrier (D) is facing competition from both the left and right as she looks to retain Washington’s 8th congressional district. Imraan Siddiqi (D), the executive director of the Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is critical of Schrier's response to the Gaza crisis. Meanwhile Republican Carmen Goers. a commercial banker and former military spouse, focuses on issues like inflation, mental health care, and rural health care access.\n\nSchrier, the district's first Democrat representative, emphasizes her bipartisan track record and commitment to healthcare and abortion rights. As the primary approaches, the more moderate incumbent hopes that a significant fundraising advantage will propel her to the finish line.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/05/amarillo-election-results-texas-house-congress-county-commissioners-voting/72856395007/", "title": "Amarillo-area election results: See who won local primaries", "text": "Polls closed at 7 p.m. in Tuesday's Republican and Democratic primary elections featuring number of federal, state and local races.

Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

And now we are going to show it better for the Brazilian population, especially the most affected class, the consequence of the ‘stay at home, we’ll see the economy later’ policy,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nBolsonaro, who has routinely discredited the Brazilian electoral system and threatened to not accept its results, managed to beat Lula in the southeast states, the most populous of the country.\n\nMore than 123 million Brazilians waited in long lines to vote in the world’s fourth largest democracy, while another 32 million abstained.

This is the most important election. I am really happy.”\n\nHe also referenced the 2018 elections, where he had been unable to run – or vote – because of a corruption conviction that was overturned last year.\n\n“Four years ago I couldn’t vote because I had been the victim of a lie in this country. And four years later, I’m here, voting with the recognition of my total freedom and with the possibility of being president of the republic of this country again, to try to make this country return to normality,” Lula said.\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva raises his fist after addressing supporters in São Paulo, Brazil, on Sunday, October 30.

He has campaigned to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. He has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (about $110) monthly benefit known as Auxilio Brasil.\n\nHis government is known for its support for ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists are warning that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nBolsonaro has also been widely criticized for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 686,000 people in Brazil have died from the virus.\n\nLula, 76, focused his campaign on getting Bolsonaro out of office and highlighted his past achievements throughout his campaign.\n\nHe left office with a 90% approval rating in 2011, and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through the “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\nHis campaign promised a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nLula, however, is also no stranger to controversy. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\nFollowers of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they listen to the partial results after polls closed in Rio de Janeiro on October 2, 2022.

Stargazers in the United States will probably need only binoculars to see the bigger comet in late March. Scientists, however, are bringing out the big guns. The Hubble Space Telescope, the powerful ground-based Gemini telescopes and others will be trained on the celestial visitors, which will provide an extraordinary close-up of objects usually glimpsed only at a distance.\n\n“This is one for the record books,” says Michael Kelley of the University of Maryland, who’s never heard of two comets approaching close to Earth a day apart. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for professionals to learn more about comets, and if you have a chance to try to find them … it’s a fantastic chance to see part of history as it happens.”\n\nThe first member of the pair, known as comet 252P/LINEAR, is a bright green color from the carbon gas it’s puffing out, says the University of Maryland’s Matthew Knight. 252P will slide past Earth at a distance of roughly 3 million miles. That’s well beyond the moon but near enough to put 252P in the top 10 of closest-approaching comets.\n\n252P wasn’t expected to get terribly bright, but it has been “surpassing all expectations,” says amateur comet-hunter Michael Mattiazzo of Australia. It may even be visible to the unaided eye in southern hemisphere suburbs where light pollution is low.\n\nAstronomers discovered the trailing member of the pair, P/2016 BA14, a few months ago. It was shrugged off as yet another asteroid, or space rock. Then astronomers peering through a telescope saw it had a tail – and was therefore a comet. That means BA14 and its larger companion “are among the closest comets to pass by Earth in recorded history,” says Knight, who took the first snapshot revealing BA14 is a comet. The only comet known to have skimmed past us at a smaller distance was Lexell’s Comet in 1770.\n\nScientists aren’t yet sure of the nature of the relationship between 252P and its hanger-on. Perhaps BA14 broke off 252P decades ago. Both comets could be pieces from an even bigger comet, or they could be unrelated.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time, astronomers have captured an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nIt’s the first direct observation confirming the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.\n\nBlack holes don’t emit light, but the image shows the shadow of the black hole surrounded by a bright ring, which is light bent by the gravity of the black hole. Astronomers said the black hole is 4 million times more massive than our sun.\n\n“For decades, astronomers have wondered what lies at the heart of our galaxy, pulling stars into tight orbits through its immense gravity,” Michael Johnson, astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement.\n\n“With the (Event Horizon Telescope or EHT) image, we have zoomed in a thousand times closer than these orbits, where the gravity grows a million times stronger. At this close range, the black hole accelerates matter to close to the speed of light and bends the paths of photons in the warped (space-time).”\n\nThe black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth. Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy, which is why we’re so distant from the galactic center. If we could see this in our night sky, the black hole would appear to be the same size as a doughnut sitting on the moon.\n\nThe Gemini North telescope captured an image of a bright new supernova in the Pinwheel Galaxy.

The Astrophysical Journal/Northwestern University Wonders of the universe Prev Next\n\n“We were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity,” said EHT project scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, in a statement.\n\n“These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very (center) of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.”\n\nThe results of this groundbreaking discovery were published Thursday in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nSearching for the black hole\n\nIt has taken five years for astronomers to capture and confirm this image and discovery. Previously, scientists observed stars orbiting some invisible, massive object at the galactic center.\n\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to scientists Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for their discoveries about black holes, including evidence shared by Ghez and Genzel about the mass of the object at the center of the Milky Way.\n\n“We now see that the black hole is swallowing the nearby gas and light, pulling them into a bottomless pit,” Ramesh Narayan, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement. “This image confirms decades of theoretical work to understand how black holes eat.”\n\nThe discovery was made possible by more than 300 researchers from 80 institutions working with a network of eight different radio telescopes around the globe that make up the Event Horizon Telescope.\n\nThe telescope is named after the “event horizon,” the point at which no light can escape from a black hole. This global telescope network essentially forms a single “Earth-size” virtual telescope when all eight are linked and observing in tandem.\n\nIt’s the second image ever captured of a black hole, with the first being the EHT’s achievement of imaging M87* at the heart of the distant Messier 87 galaxy, located 55 million light-years away, in 2019.\n\nThese panels show the first two black hole images. On the left is M87*, and the right is Sagittarius A*. European Southern Observatory/EHT Collaboration\n\nWhile the two images look similar, Sagittarius A* is more than 1,000 times smaller than M87*.\n\n“We have two completely different types of galaxies and two very different black hole masses, but close to the edge of these black holes they look amazingly similar,” said Sera Markoff, cochair of the EHT Science Council and a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, in a statement.\n\n“This tells us that (Einstein’s theory of) General Relativity governs these objects up close, and any differences we see further away must be due to differences in the material that surrounds the black holes.”\n\nCapturing an impossible image\n\nAlthough the Milky Way’s black hole is closer to Earth, it was much harder to image.\n\n“The gas in the vicinity of the black holes moves at the same speed – nearly as fast as light – around both Sgr A* and M87*,” EHT scientist Chi-kwan Chan at the Steward Observatory and Department of Astronomy and the Data Science Institute of the University of Arizona, said in a statement.\n\n“But where gas takes days to weeks to orbit the larger M87*, in the much smaller Sgr A* it completes an orbit in mere minutes. This means the brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* was changing rapidly as the EHT Collaboration was observing it – a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail.”\n\nIf the supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A* were next to each other, Sagittarius A* would be dwarfed by M87*, which is over 1,000 times more massive. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nThe global network of astronomers had to develop new tools to allow for the quick movement of gas around Sagittarius A*. The resulting image is an average of different ones taken by the team. Taking the Sagittarius A* image was like capturing a photo of a grain of salt in New York City using a camera in Los Angeles, according to California Institute of Technology researchers.\n\n“This image from the Event Horizon Telescope required more than just snapping a picture from telescopes on high mountaintops. It is the product of both technically challenging telescope observations and innovative computational algorithms,” Katherine Bouman, Rosenberg scholar and assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences, electrical engineering and astronomy at the Caltech, said during a press conference.\n\nBouman also worked on capturing the M87* image shared in 2019. Despite the fact that the Sagittarius A* image may seem blurry, “it’s one of the sharpest images ever made,” Bouman said.\n\nEach telescope was pushed to its limit, which is called a diffraction limit, or the maximum fine features that it can see.\n\n“And that’s basically the level that we’re seeing here,” Johnson said at the press conference. “It’s fuzzy because to make a sharper image, we need to move our telescopes further apart or go into higher frequencies.”\n\nOn the horizon\n\nHaving images of two very different black holes will allow astronomers to determine their similarities and differences and better understand how gas behaves around supermassive black holes, which could contribute to the formation and evolution of galaxies. It is believed that black holes exist at the center of most galaxies, acting like an engine that powers them.\n\nSagittarius A* is at the center of our own galaxy, while M87* resides more than 55 million light-years from Earth. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nMeanwhile, the EHT team is working to expand the telescope network and conduct upgrades that could lead to even more stunning images, and even movies, of black holes in the future.\n\nCapturing a black hole in motion can show how it changes over time and what the gas does as it swirls around a black hole. Bouman and EHT member Antonio Fuentes, who will join Caltech as a postdoctoral researcher in October, are developing methods that will allow them to stitch images of the black hole together to reflect this motion.\n\nThis “first direct image of the gentle giant in the center of our galaxy” is just the beginning, said Feryal Özel, member of the EHT Science Council and a professor of astronomy and physics and associate dean for research at the University of Arizona, during the press conference.\n\n“This image is a testament to what we can accomplish, when as a global research community, we bring our brightest minds together to make the seemingly impossible, possible,” National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. “Language, continents and even the galaxy can’t stand in the way of what humanity can accomplish when we come together for the greater good of all.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/04/07/when-will-2024-total-solar-eclipse-delaware-happen-follow-our-april-8-2024-coverage/73217650007/", "title": "When will the 2024 solar eclipse happen?

While it has dominated news coverage for weeks, it's for good reason: There won't be another solar eclipse in the U.S. for 20 years.\n\nJournalists with Delaware Online/The News Journal will be out and about throughout the day, reporting from communities, schools and museums.\n\nWhether you're excited about the eclipse or ready for the news media to focus on something else, here's everything you need to know about the event.\n\nDelaware won’t be getting a full view of the total solar eclipse today, but the Small Wonder will still be in for a couple hours of worthwhile viewing time.\n\nHere’s what your eclipse itinerary for Monday, April 8, looks like.\n\nLater today, the moon will move between Earth and the sun, causing the sun's usual circular shape to transform into a crescent and temporarily plunge parts of our planet into darkness during broad daylight. Lasting just a few minutes, the eclipse promises to be a remarkable sight, but some may be worried that April showers and cloudy skies will ruin the experience.\n\nHere's the latest weather update for Monday, April 8, and what to expect in the sky during Delaware's view of the celestial phenomenon.\n\nWith the rare total solar eclipse happening on Monday, April 8, many people may be wondering where to watch the eclipse and when it's happening.\n\nThe total solar eclipse, which will not be visible again to the contiguous U.S. until 2044, can be witnessed by people in certain parts of the nation.\n\nThe path will allow only a partial solar eclipse for Delaware, but the eclipse is still expected to be a sight to behold.\n\nWatch parties, livestreams and even going out to your backyard are all options to watch, as long as safety measures are taken to protect eyesight, such as solar eclipse glasses.\n\nThe total solar eclipse is a few days away.\n\nWith Delaware’s week of heavy rain and flooding in the rearview, some might be wondering how the weather will play out on the day of the eclipse.\n\nHere’s the forecast for the eclipse on April 8.\n\nThe path of the totality of the total solar eclipse on April 8 has shifted based on new calculations, but Delaware remains outside of the main action.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the updated path of totality.\n\nApril 8 is quickly approaching so you know what that means — total solar eclipse time!\n\nSo as you prepare for the big event, see what time the eclipse will appear in your zip code:\n\nThe last time a total solar eclipse was visible in the contiguous United States was Aug. 21, 2017, but this year’s eclipse April 8 could be viewed by more people and may have more spectacular results.\n\nAnd this might be your last chance for two decades. According to NASA, the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States will be in 2044.\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the sun.\n\nWith the total solar eclipse coming up soon, it’s time to finalize your watch party plans.\n\nHere’s what weather Delawareans can expect to see on Monday, April 8, and what that means for eclipse viewing.\n\nAs you gather your supplies and draft your plans for the total solar eclipse in April, don’t forget the most important part of your itinerary: what time the eclipse will occur.\n\nIf you need a refresher, don’t fret.

Maybe you recall the logo for the mid-2000s show \"Heroes\" on NBC. The \"o\" was an eclipse image which showed the last bits of sunlight concentrated in one area before being totally obscured by the moon. Did you know this particular moment has a name and you have a chance to see it or capture it (with the right gear of course) on Monday?\n\nHere are some things take notice of and the words to put to what you are seeing during the total solar eclipse.\n\nDiamond ring effect and Baily's beads\n\nThe description above of the \"Heroes\" logo refers to what's called the diamond ring effect. One section on the edge of the disc will be extra bright and resemble a diamond sparkling on a circular wedding band. Astrophysicist Alain Brizard, who is professor of physics at St. Michael's College described it as \"the sun's last attempt to be relevant.\" This happens within moments of the moon fully obscuring the sun.\n\nAfter the diamond ring effect, you may notice what's called Baily's beads. This will look like small beads of light chained together along one edge of the circle. The topography of the moon is varied with mountains and valleys so the Baily's beads phenomenon is caused by the sunlight peeking through some of those lower level valleys, Brizard explained.\n\nOnce the Baily's beads disappear, this is your indication that totality has begun. This is also the moment you can remove your solar eclipse glasses and external filters covering cameras, telescopes or binocular lenses for about 3 minutes and 15 seconds (the estimated totality time for the Burlington area) only. At the end of totality the same thing will happen again, though in reverse. Be sure to put your glasses back on before Baily's beads appear again.\n\nThe moon's path will make a diagonal pass from the bottom right to the upper left of the sun. Look for the diamond ring effect and Baily's beads at the top left before totality and then near the bottom of the sun at the end of totality. You can see a simulation of the entire eclipse from the vantage point of Burlington at https://eclipse2024.org/eclipse-simulator/2024/index.html?city_id=41016.\n\nHere's a breakdown of timing for the Burlington area. (Note: times are expressed in p.m.):\n\n2:13 and 46 seconds - Partiality begins\n\n3:25 and 57 seconds - Diamond ring effect (lasts 5 seconds)\n\n3:26 and 2 seconds - Baily's beads (lasts 5 seconds)\n\n3:26 and 7 seconds to 3:29 and 26 seconds - TOTALITY (three minutes and 19 seconds in Burlington area. Only time when glasses and filters can be off.)\n\n3:29 and 20 seconds put eclipse glasses and filters back on for safety\n\n3:29 and 26 seconds - Baily's beads and then Diamond ring effect\n\n4:38 and 46 seconds - Partiality ends\n\nWhat to look for during totality - from planets to prominences from the sun\n\nWhile the sun will be covered up by the moon, viewers will have the opportunity to see details of the sun and sky that normally can't be seen due to the brightness of the sun. The sun's chromosphere may be visible briefly; it would look like a thin, red layer around the sun. Red, tongue-like protrusions extending off the surface of the sun, called prominences, may also be observed. Assuming the skies are clear, the sun's corona is likely to be seen even without the use of magnification. The corona would look like a ghostly white halo surrounding the sun.\n\nWhile the skies turn dark, you may be able to spot some planets and stars during the day time. \"It looks like the skies will be crowded,\" Brizard said looking at a night sky map during the time of the eclipse. From left to right, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and Mars would fall in a line along their orbit of the sun. Venus may be one of the brightest objects in the sky with Sirius being the brightest star in the sky while our sun's light is dimmed. Brizard also suggested looking for two prominent red spots. To the left of the sun and moon will be Aldebaran the eye of the Taurus constellation and Mars, further to the right of the convergence.\n\nA mirrorball of little partial eclipses\n\nFor some fun, you could project hundreds of little partial eclipses on the ground during the time before and after totality. Take a colander or anything with small holes in it and hold it up to the light while watching the ground. Like a mirrorball, the colander will scatter eclipse shapes across the ground. Brizard said it works best to stand on concrete or a flat surface, rather than grass or dirt. The scientific process that creates this effect has a name: camera obscura.\n\nWhy this total solar eclipse is special\n\nThere are some factors that make this eclipse special even among other total solar eclipses. The relative sizes of the moon and sun, when viewed from earth, will be about as equal as it gets. This means no \"ring of fire\" around the moon and the surface of the sun will be covered without too much of the corona being obscured.\n\nThis optimal alignment can only occur because of where the moon is in its elliptical orbit around the earth and where the earth is in its elliptical orbit around the sun. The moon, for instance, will be at its perigee − the closest it gets to the earth − one day earlier on April 7. So, the moon will appear larger than normal and larger than the 2017 eclipse. On the other hand, the earth's orbit puts the sun at its mid-point, size-wise and closeness to our planet. In January the earth is the closest it gets to the sun, also called perihelion, and in July the earth is furthest from the sun during its orbit, called aphelion.\n\nAlso interesting is the timing of the sun's solar cycle. Every eleven years or so the sun reaches its maximum level of activity and right now we are in that phase. That means more prominences, sun spots or coronal mass ejections can happen and solar winds bring more magnetic storms to earth which produce the aurora borealis. Sun astrophotographers, in particular, will be using the three and half minutes of moon coverage to get as many photos as they can to study the sun's corona during this time.\n\nSolar eclipses are categorized and belong to a series, which the ancient Babylonians first began tracking. The path of moon's shadow on the earth starts at one of the poles and travels toward the other pole over time, ending that series. This particular eclipse will be part of the Saros 139 series which began in 1501 and will end in 2763. Brizard said it is an unusual astronomical situation to take part in something that began as far back as the renaissance period in earth's history.\n\nAs much as there is so much to see, categorize and document, Brizard says it may be best to leave all that up to the scientists and don't forget to experience the moment as a human being who happens to be upon this earth, in this place in an auspicious time. It's a great community building event, he said, and it may be best to forego all the equipment and just look up. \"We spend our lives looking at screens and kids − they're always looking at screens,\" he said. \"For three minutes or an hour on Monday the 8th, everybody will be outside. As a community, people will be looking at the same place in the sky.\"\n\nContact reporter April Barton at abarton@freepressmedia.com or 802-660-1854.

YR4's discovery even prompted no shortage of comparisons to Apophis, its much larger cousin that gave humanity quite a scare in 2004 when calculations initially found that it had a decent chance of striking Earth in 2029.\n\nFor a few weeks, YR4's probability of impact steadily rose and rose, even briefly reaching record levels, before – mercifully – beginning to drop. Now, just as the infamous cruise ship-sized Apophis was eventually ruled out as a threat to Earth, so too has 2024 YR4.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nLatest calculations put risk of YR4 impact close to zero\n\nYR4's probability of impacting Earth first began to fall last Wednesday when NASA announced the odds had dropped to 1.5%.\n\nNASA then gave the \"all clear\" in a post Monday on social media site X, announcing that odds of YR4 impacting Earth have fallen to .004% when it passes by on Dec. 22, 2032. In fact, YR4 now has a higher chance of crashing into the moon that year, with odds standing at 1.7%, according to NASA.\n\n\"There is no significant potential for this asteroid to impact our planet for the next century,\" the space agency added in a blog post.\n\nThe European Space Agency shared a similar risk assessment of its own Tuesday, finding that the probability was .001%.\n\nThe asteroid also now rates as a 0 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, a method for astronomers to categorize and rate the threat of near-Earth objects. YR4 peaked at a 3 on the scale, which ranges from 0 (no chance of impact) to 10 (a collision is certain and would cause worldwide devastation.)\n\nWhat to know about asteroid YR4\n\nBecause it's big enough to destroy a city asteroid 2024 YR4 became a source of alarm due to the uncommonly high risk it had of colliding with Earth.\n\nThe space rock was spotted late last year and reported on Dec. 27, 2024, to the Minor Planet Center, the official authority for observing and reporting new asteroids, comets and other small bodies in the solar system. The object eventually caught the attention of NASA and other astronomers when it rose on the U.S. Space Agency's Sentry Impact Risk Table, which tracks any known asteroids with a non-zero probability of hitting Earth.\n\nFor a time, it was the only object among more than 37,000 known large space rocks with any chance of hitting Earth anytime soon.\n\nInitial projections gave the asteroid little more than a 1% chance of impacting Earth. Those odds steadily increased before peaking at 3.1%.\n\nWhile those odds may not sound high, that probability of a collision with Earth represented a record for large space rock.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope to study asteroid in March\n\nYR4's infamy meant that astronomers would be paying close attention to it.\n\nAnd just because it's been dismissed as a threat doesn't mean scientists are forgetting about it.\n\nThe asteroid will continue to be visible from Earth through April, giving astronomers some time to gather data with ground-based telescopes. While the asteroid won't again be observable from Earth until June 2028, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope will be able to study it in March from orbit.\n\nNASA and the European Space Agency are also interested in getting a better look at Apophis before and during its close approach to Earth in 2029.\n\nThough both YR4 and Apophis are no longer a risk to Earth, astronomers maintain that studying them could help the world's space agencies in mounting a planetary defense if the day ever comes that an asteroid does pose a threat.\n\nProtecting Earth from incoming space rocks could look a little like the test NASA pulled off in 2022 when it slammed into an asteroid during its Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART. Though the asteroid Dimorphos posed no threat to Earth, the maneuver demonstrated that it could be possible to nudge incoming objects out of harm's way.\n\nAs of October, a craft from the ESA is on the way to get an up-close look at the asteroid's remnants.\n\nNASA is additionally working on an asteroid-hunting telescope known as the NEO Surveyor to find near-Earth objects capable of causing significant damage. Now set to launch no earlier than 2027, the telescope is designed to discover 90% of asteroids and comets that are 460 feet in size or larger and come within 30 million miles of Earth’s orbit.\n\nContributing: Fernando Cervantes Jr., James Powel, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In astronomy, this is called a conjunction, when two objects appear near each other in the sky. Venus will be the brighter of the two star-like objects, and just above Venus will be the red planet Mars. Filling out the right side of the triangle will be a thin crescent Moon. All three objects will make a spectacular sight in binoculars, and the two planets should be visible in a small telescope at the same time. This celestial triangle will not last long, because the moon will move significantly eastward (13 degrees) each night. However, Venus and Mars will remain close together on Feb. 21-22.\n\nOn the opposite side of the sky will be the massive planet Jupiter. It will be seen just as it gets dark, dazzling and bright in the east. This gas giant is so big that all the other planets in our solar system could fit inside it. It is also famous for its red spot and its many moons. Astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered Jupiter's four largest moons in 1610 with an early version of the telescope. These moons are known today as Galilean satellites.\n\nIncidentally, Galileo used his discovery of Jupiter's moons as evidence that the Earth was not the center of our solar system. Decades later his observations would lead to the acceptance of Mikołaj Kopernik's theory that the sun was the center of our solar system.\n\nUpcoming programs\n\nThe last of Kopernik Observatory and Science Center's special winter programs will be \"Majestic Jupiter\" at 7 p.m. Friday. Learn more about Jupiter and the various spacecraft that have explored this planet.\n\nIn March, Kopernik resumes its weekly Friday night public programs. Have you ever thought about trying to brew your own beer? On March 6, brewmaster Seth Weisel from Galaxy Brewing Co. in Binghamton will discuss the basics of beer brewing. Find out about barley germination, malting processes, fermentation and various aspects of beer haze, foam and color, and more.\n\nOn March 13, Alex Harvilchuck from the Susquehanna Astronomical Society will present an introduction to radio astronomy, explaining how astronomers view celestial objects using radio waves.\n\nSee Kopernik's website for the rest of the spring Friday night line-up, which includes a variety of speakers and topics.\n\nTime for some pi\n\nOn March 14, Kopernik will celebrate Pi Day honoring the mathematical constant pi (π) — the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14. This year has special significance. At 9:26:53 a.m., the date and time will represent the first 10 digits of pi, 3.141592653.\n\nKopernik will mark the occasion with family-friendly activities and contests. Doors will open at 8:30 a.m. There will be a pi digit-memorization contest, pi shuffleboard, pi-ku poetry writing and a pi scavenger hunt. March 14 also is the birthday of Albert Einstein. Come in costume for an Einstein impersonator contest.\n\nFor the kids\n\nUpcoming classes at Kopernik include \"Extreme Magnification\" on Saturday, March 7, for students in grades 6-8. They will explore the smallest parts of our world using high magnification, capture images of tiny objects, and use software to creatively manipulate these images.\n\nOn Saturday, March 21, children age 3-6 are invited to \"Weather,\" the next class in the KoperniKids series. They will explore the different types of weather and make some instruments to measure it.\n\nStudents in grades 8-12 can learn about observing the night sky at \"Observational Astronomy\" on Friday and Saturday, March 27-28. This two-evening class will include training on the use of binoculars, Dobsonian and other basic telescopes, as well as more sophisticated systems such as our Celestron 14-inch telescope!\n\n\"Electricity & Magnetism,\" originally scheduled for Feb. 16, was rescheduled for Saturday, Feb. 28, due to weather. A few spots remain for interested fifth- and sixth-grade students who want to spend some time with Dr. Dangerous (Nicholas Guydosh, Ph.D.) making lightning and learning how to create magnetism from electricity and electricity from magnetism.\n\nKopernik will offer several classes during the school spring break. Girls in grades 3-5 and 6-8 can attend separate sessions of \"Girl Power: Girls who Code\" and learn about computer programming. Boys and girls in grades 6-8 can have fun with stop motion animation at \"Lights, Camera, Stop Motion!\"\n\nEven though the ground is covered in deep snow, it is not too early to think about summer camps at Kopernik. These week-long camps offer students in grades 1-12 fun, hands-on, high-tech adventures in science, technology, engineering and math in a nurturing environment.

While NASA spacecraft have been busy studying asteroids, gas giants and terrestrial planets, ocean worlds have largely remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nAnd though Europa has been imaged before, no vehicles have gotten as up-close a look as the Clipper should get. When the uncrewed orbiter reaches the moon by 2030, it will begin the historic task of mapping and scanning above and beneath Europa's surface to determine whether the celestial body is indeed habitable, as scientists have long suspected.\n\nWith the launch window set to open as soon as Oct. 10, NASA officials took the time Tuesday to provide an update on the Europa Clipper mission during a news conference.\n\n\"Our journey of exploration and discovery is about to begin,\" said Laurie Leshin, director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in prepared remarks. \"This is an incredibly impressive mission.\"\n\nWhy are scientists interested in Europa?\n\nThe fourth largest of Jupiter’s 95 moons, Europa is an icy celestial body teeming with enigma and intrigue.\n\nThough Europa is slightly smaller than Earth’s own moon and barely one-quarter the diameter of Earth, beneath its surface is a vast salty ocean twice the size of Earth’s own oceans combined. Scientists have long theorized that the icy crust above the ocean conceals evidence of organic compounds and energy sources – ingredients that are the stuff of life.\n\nThe icy shell encasing Europa – named for a woman from Greek mythology abducted by Zeus (Jupiter, in Roman mythology) – was first detected in 1972 through telescope observations. Thermal models a year earlier also suggested the presence of the layer of liquid water flowing beneath it, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is the Europa Clipper mission?\n\nIf the conditions to support life do indeed exist on Europa, then NASA is hoping the Clipper will be able to discover them.\n\n\"There's very strong evidence that the ingredients for life exist on Europa, but we have to go there to find out,\" Bonnie Buratti, deputy project scientist for the Clipper mission, said during Tuesday's news conference.\n\nAstronomers believe oceans worlds such as Europa are common outside of our solar system, so studying Europa could prove to be the first step to understanding how life could exist beyond Earth. But NASA officials were clear on one point: The Clipper is not looking to find life itself; just the conditions that could support it.\n\nDuring the course of 49 close flybys of Europa, the Clipper will gather and relay data to help scientists determine, for instance, the subsurface's salinity and how deep the water is, said Gina DiBraccio, acting director of NASA's Planetary Science Division.\n\n\"NASA is so excited to being one step closer to answering fundamental questions about the solar system and beyond,\" DiBraccio said in prepared remarks. \"This is going to pave the way for the future: for future missions to Europa and elsewhere in our solar system where we can search more directly for life.\"\n\nWhat to know about the Clipper spacecraft\n\nWith its massive solar arrays and radar antennas, the Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission.\n\nBigger than a basketball court, the spacecraft extends 100 feet from one end to the other and is about 58 feet across. With no propellant in the tank, the Europa Clipper weighs about 7,145 pounds.\n\nThe orbiter's solar arrays alone, which need to be huge so they can collect enough sunlight while near Jupiter to power the craft, measure about 46.5 feet long and about 13.5 feet high.\n\nThough mission engineers plotted orbits to limit the Clipper's time amid Jupiter's most intense radiation, the spacecraft was also designed with a thick-walled vault made of titanium and aluminum to shield sensitive electronics.\n\nNASA spacecraft have imaged Europa before – but not like this\n\nSix spacecraft have visited Europa since it became one of the first moons found beyond Earth.\n\nNASA’s Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft flew by Jupiter in the early 1970s, but the first spacecraft to image the surfaces of Jupiter's moons in significant detail were the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1979. NASA's Junospacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since July 2016.\n\nHowever, it was the imaging conducted in the 1990s during the Galileo mission that provided the most data on Europa to date.\n\nScientists have long been intrigued by the moon's surprising lack of large impact craters that lend it a notably smooth surface, especially relative to the other icy moons. Galileo's imaging also revealed reddish-brown cracks slicing the surface that scientists hope to better understand when the Clipper arrives.\n\nThe Europa Clipper's flybys will cover both hemispheres of the moon, the closest of which will be at an altitude of 16 miles above Europa's surface, NASA says.\n\nOn board, the Europa Clipper will carry nine observational instruments, including cameras needed for high-resolution imaging and an ice-penetrating radar to search for the subsurface water. The instruments, which will also study the moon's geology and atmosphere, will operate simultaneously on every pass so that scientists can layer the data together to paint a full picture of the moon.\n\n\"Every mission we have ever been to, we have always uncovered things we could not have imagined,\" Buratti said. \"There's going to be something there, the unknown, that is going to be so wonderful that we can't conceive of it right now.\"\n\nWhen will the Europa Clipper launch?\n\nNASA officials said Tuesday that the Europa Clipper remains on track to be ready when the launch window opens Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nEngineers have been hard at work readying the spacecraft to endure both a launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket as well as the harsh conditions of the vacuum of space, said Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The orbiter is now prepared to get fueled up and head to Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Evans said.\n\nAhead of the spacecraft is a 1.8 billion-mile journey to Europa on a trajectory taking it past Mars and then Earth, using the planets’ gravity as a slingshot to add speed for the trek. After journeying for more than five years, the Europa Clipper will fire its engines to enter Jupiter's orbit in 2030.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information and because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

For a time, the odds of impact fluctuated around 1% before suddenly jumping in recent days to 2.3%.\n\nThe unsettling odds are the highest any asteroid has had of impacting Earth in more than two decades since the infamous Apophis was first discovered and later ruled out as a threat.

The risk of Apophis impacting Earth during its 2029 flyby even rose as high as 2.7% on the Sentry Impact Risk Table.\n\nIn the case of Apophis, further observations eventually allowed astronomers in 2021 to rule out the possibility of an impact when the asteroid makes a close flyby to Earth in 2029 and again in 2036.\n\nNASA, other space agencies build planetary defense from asteroids\n\nIn the coming years, both NASA and the European Space Agency plan to take advantage of the rare flyby by sending uncrewed spacecraft to observe Apophis.\n\nIt's one of the many plans the agencies have in place as part of a larger effort to build a defense to protect humanity from threats posed by asteroids and other inbound space rocks.\n\nIn September 2022, NASA demonstrated that it was possible to nudge an incoming asteroid out of harm's way by slamming a spacecraft into it as part of its Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART.\n\nLaunched in November 2021, DART traveled for more than 10 months before crashing into Dimorphos at roughly 14,000 mph.

This will take Solar Orbiter inside the orbit of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun.\n\nThe European Space Agency, which jointly manages the mission with NASA, will share the first images and data within a few weeks because it will take time to download and analyze everything gathered during the flyby, according to ESA.\n\nYou can track Solar Orbiter’s progress using a tool developed by ESA to follow the sun explorer’s journey.\n\nSolar Orbiter’s 10 instruments will be running simultaneously, ready to measure the solar wind and keep an eye out for mini flares, called campfires, that researchers spied in the mission’s first images in 2020. The spacecraft also carries high-resolution telescopes.\n\nThe data collected during the flyby could help scientists unlock some of the biggest remaining solar mysteries, including why and how the temperature rises through the sun’s atmosphere.\n\nSolar Orbiter will also capture high-resolution images of the sun and record the solar wind, an energized flow of particles that stream away from the sun.\n\n“From this point onwards, we are ‘entering the unknown’ as far as Solar Orbiter’s observations of the Sun are concerned,” said Daniel Müller, Solar Orbiter project scientist, in a statement.\n\nStunning images\n\nThe latest images shared by Solar Orbiter provide a new perspective of the sun that captures unprecedented detail, including the highest-resolution image ever taken of the sun’s outer atmosphere. The images were taken on March 7 as the spacecraft crossed directly between Earth and the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft was halfway between the two celestial bodies, at a distance of about 46 million miles (74 million kilometers) from the sun.\n\nSolar Orbiter's new image shows the sun in extreme ultraviolet light. ESA & NASA/Solar Orbiter/EUI team\n\nOne shot, taken using the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument, called SPICE, is the first full sun image of its kind in 50 years, showcased in ultraviolet light.\n\nDifferent wavelengths of light can help researchers study temperature differences between the solar surface and the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere.\n\nThe corona can reach a million degrees Celsius (1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit), while the surface is 5,000 degrees Celsius (9,000 degrees Fahrenheit). Solar Orbiter could help determine why the temperature seems to rise away from the sun’s core, rather than drop.\n\nThis is just one of Solar Orbiter’s first close passes of the sun, with many more flybys planned to bring it closer and closer to the star in the coming years. Gradually, the spacecraft will raise its orientation to study the sun’s never-before-seen polar regions.\n\nSolar Orbiter comes equipped with a multilayer heatshield, a special coating called “Solar Black” made using burnt bone, sliding doors that protect its instruments, solar arrays that can tilt away from the worst of the heat and cooling elements inside the spacecraft. Together, these keep the spacecraft from melting as it studies the sun.\n\nHeating up\n\nThe sun is getting more active, and Solar Orbiter has been watching its solar temper tantrums.\n\nA large solar flare exploded from the sun on March 2. The eruption was rated as M-class, the fourth strongest type of the five categories measuring solar flare intensity. A burst of this strength can cause brief radio blackouts at Earth’s poles and minor radiation storms that might endanger astronauts on the International Space Station, according to NASA.\n\nThe Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on the Solar Orbiter captured a video of the dramatic event.\n\nSolar flare close up\n\nMeanwhile, the Parker Solar Probe, which became the first spacecraft to “touch the sun” at the end of 2021, recently experienced the extremes of a large solar prominence when the sun released tons of charged particles in Parker’s direction on February 15.\n\nIf solar flares and storms – like the impressive flare on February 15 (also captured by Solar Orbiter) or the solar storm that impacted SpaceX’s Starlink satellites in February – seem to be occurring more frequently, it’s because the sun is ramping up activity as it heads toward solar maximum.\n\nIt’s important to understand the solar cycle because space weather caused by the sun – eruptions like solar flares and coronal mass ejection events – can impact the power grid, satellites, GPS, airlines, rockets and astronauts in space.\n\nEvery 11 years, the sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one. The current solar cycle, Solar Cycle 25, officially began in December 2019 and the next solar maximum, when the sun is experiencing peak activity, is predicted to occur in July 2025.\n\nOver the course of a solar cycle, the sun transitions from a calm period to one that is very intense and active. This activity is tracked by counting sunspots and how many are visible over time. Sunspots, or dark spots on the sun, are the origin point for the explosive flares and ejection events that release light, solar material and energy into space.\n\nThis puts Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe in perfect position to watch as we head toward solar maximum.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/world/earth-trojan-asteroid-scn", "title": "Earth has a newly discovered rare asteroid companion | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

A study detailing the discovery of the Earth Trojan asteroid published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n“Trojans are objects sharing an orbit with a planet, clustered around one of two special gravitationally balanced areas along the orbit of the planet known as Lagrange points,” said study coauthor Cesar Briceño, SOAR telescope scientist at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, in a statement.\n\nLagrange points are regions of space where the gravitational pull from the sun and one of the planets is balanced, said lead study author Toni Santana-Ros, a researcher from the University of Alicante and Institute of Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe stable orbit of Earth Trojan asteroids would make them ideal for flybys from future space missions.\n\n“If we are able to discover more Earth Trojans, and if some of them can have orbits with lower inclinations, they might become cheaper to reach than our Moon,” Briceño said. “So they might become ideal bases for an advanced exploration of the Solar System, or they could even be a source of resources.”\n\nThis diagram shows the five Lagrange points for the Earth-sun system. The newly discovered asteroid is in the L4 orbit. J. da Silva//NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/Spa\n\nTrojan asteroids, which take their name from Greek mythology, have been found orbiting the sun along the same path as planets like Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter has more than 5,000 known Trojan asteroids that race ahead of and trail behind the giant planet. The recently launched NASA Lucy mission will be the first to explore some of Jupiter’s Trojans on its ambitious 12-year journey.\n\nThis is also the larger of the two Earth Trojan asteroids so far, measuring about 0.73 miles (1.2 kilometers) in diameter. The first one, 2010 TK7, was found over a decade ago, and it’s about three times smaller.\n\nAstronomers initially spotted the newly found Trojan asteroid on December 12, 2020, using the Pan-STARRS1 survey telescope in Hawai’i and followed up with observations from other telescopes. At first, they thought it was just a near-Earth asteroid crossing our planet’s orbit, but data from the SOAR telescope was compared with previous observations captured by the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope in Chile from 2012 to 2019.\n\nNearly a decade’s worth of data helped scientists refine the asteroid’s orbit to confirm that it’s a Trojan asteroid. The space rock will maintain its current orbit for the next 4,000 years before gravity will likely send it off on a journey through space or in a highly elliptical orbit around the sun.\n\nResearchers also determined that it’s a C-type asteroid that contains a lot of carbon, making it the most common type of asteroid found in our solar system. It’s possible that this object originated from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but was kicked out due to the massive gravitational influence of Jupiter. But more research is needed to determine the asteroid’s origin.\n\nDiscovery challenges\n\nAstronomers think there are likely many more Earth Trojan asteroids to discover, but they are incredibly difficult to spot. Trojan asteroids are on orbits that place them in front of or behind a planet as it orbits the sun, and the asteroids appear close to the sun in our sky if we’re observing them from Earth.\n\nObservations of Trojan asteroids can only be carried out very close to sunrise or sunset with telescopes aimed near the horizon. This configuration means the telescopes have to peer through the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere. The SOAR telescope was able to point 16 degrees above the horizon.\n\nThis graphic shows where 2020 XL5 would appear in the sky from Cerro Pachón in Chile. J. da Silva//NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/Spa\n\n“These were very challenging observations, requiring the telescope to track correctly at its lowest elevation limit, as the object was very low on the western horizon at dawn,” Briceño said.\n\nAs more and more satellite constellations are launched, this could impact astronomers trying to observe objects just above the horizon.\n\nFinding more Earth Trojan asteroids could shed light on the early days of our solar system.\n\n“Asteroids are time capsules from the earliest days of our Solar System and can teach us lots about the era of planetary formation,” Santana-Ros said. “Earth Trojans are particularly interesting, as they could be leftover material from the formation of Earth. Finding an Earth Trojan made of material leftover from Earth’s formation would be incredibly helpful for unravelling many secrets of the early Solar System.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}]}

Trump, who'd been expected to sign a deal, abruptly sent Zelenskyy packing, saying in a social media post that the Ukrainian president could \"come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\nZelenskyy stated on Sunday he was still prepared to sign the agreement. \"I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard,\" he told reporters, through a translator, in London, where European leaders convened a hasty meeting after the blowup.\n\n\"I think our relationship will continue,\" Zelenskyy said of the U.S. \"I do not think it's right when such discussions are totally open.\"\n\nThe shouting match between Trump, Vance and Zelenskyy left the deal, and U.S. military support for Ukraine, in the air, as Europe scrambled to cobble together a separate peace plan. Since he took office, Trump has made an about-face in the country's financial support for Ukraine, first demanding economic payback in the form of the mineral deal, then signaling after Friday's fight that additional U.S. military assistance could be on the line.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has said he would sign the minerals deal, but he wants a clear commitment from the U.S. about protection for his country.\n\nHours after the Oval Office clash, Zelenskyy said he intended to sign a deal, telling Fox News host Brett Baier it would be the \"first step to security guarantees.\"\n\n\"But it's not enough,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has since pulled back from the talks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying on Sunday that a deal was \"not at present\" on the table. \"It's unclear now. President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing,\" he said in an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n“What's the use in having an economic agreement that's going to be rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue? President Trump wants a peace deal,\" Bessent said.\n\nThe minerals agreement would set up a joint fund for the U.S. and Ukraine in which 50% of the proceeds from future investments in government-owned natural resources would be deposited. The framework agreement does not include a commitment from the U.S. to support the country militarily against Russia's invasion, an event that marked its third anniversary last week.\n\nTrump suggested Friday evening that he did not want to provide the country with more weapons as part of the minerals agreement because it would not get the U.S. closer to his immediate goal of bringing the war to an end. He'd said earlier in the day before the dispute with Zelenskyy that he was willing to arm Ukraine but was looking to advance peace talks.\n\nInstead, Trump has said the agreement itself is a long-term security guarantee because Russia will not want to attack Ukraine if American businesses and workers are in the country.\n\nTrump has also said the U.S. has not received enough in exchange for the more-than-$100 billion it has already provided Ukraine since the war began – a sharp contrast from the policy of former President Joe Biden, who gave Kyiv open-ended support in its effort to confront Russian aggression.\n\nEx-Trump ambassador calls clash 'classic negotiation'\n\nGordon Sondland, Trump's former ambassador to the European Union, who testified against the president in his first impeachment case, said that the U.S. and Ukraine are in the midst of a \"classic negotiation\" that the president allowed to play out publicly to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"There will be a deal signed with Zelenskyy, there's no question about it,\" Sondland predicted on Friday night. \"Maybe Zelenskyy has to fight a little further and realize that he doesn't have any cards to play, but there will be a deal.\"\n\nSondland said of Trump, \"He's a real estate guy. And do you know how many negotiations over a building or a lease, people storm out, say, 'F--k you, we'll never talk again.' And then someone calls someone back a day later?\"\n\nThe ex-Trump ambassador said the minerals deal \"is almost as good as any other security guarantee\" because Putin is not going to want to launch an attack that endangers American workers. Whoever succeeds Trump as president would have to keep that pressure on Ukraine though, he said.\n\nEurope finds an alternative to support Ukraine\n\nIn the wake of the Oval Office shouting match, European leaders have signaled they are ready to take up the mantle of support for Ukraine as the Trump administration pulls away. European leaders, led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, met in London over the weekend to draw up a peace deal to present to Trump.\n\nStarmer stepped up to offer a vast swath of military resources to guarantee Ukraine's security, including British boots on the ground. But any agreement would need U.S. support, he said.\n\n\"I've always been clear that that is going to need a U.S. backstop, because I don't think it would be a guarantee without it,\" he said on Sunday.\n\nStarmer waved away calls from British politicians to cancel an invitation he gave Trump to visit London amid the dustup. He visited Trump in Washington last week but left without a firm commitment the U.S. would back a peacekeeping force.\n\nTrump has pushed Europe to take a larger stake in support for Ukraine, including pushing NATO allies to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense – more than double the current guidelines.\n\n\"We welcome Europe stepping up for Europe,\" Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday. \"But they also have to invest in the capabilities to do so.\"\n\n\"All of that was evident and repeatedly communicated with the Ukrainians before Friday,\" Waltz said, adding that Zelenskyy could have left the meeting with Trump \"with an economic guarantee that would have benefited Ukraine, and I think the world for a generation.\"\n\nTrump administration officials, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, convened with their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia earlier this month to kickstart negotiations to end the war in a meeting that did not include Ukrainian representatives. Trump also held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin – the first confirmed direct contact with Putin from a U.S. leader since the war began – before the administration's talks in Saudi Arabia last month.\n\nZelenskyy has underscored since the start of the war that a peace deal would need to include a guarantee of Ukraine's security against further Russian aggression. Otherwise, there would be nothing to stop Putin from launching yet another invasion, as he did of Crimea in 2014 and the entirety of Ukraine eight years later, Zelenskyy and his allies say.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said it's in the strategic and financial interest of the United States to move forward with the minerals deal.\n\nChina has more critical materials under its control than the U.S., and the competitor nation could withhold access to them in the future, Herbst said.\n\n\"They've been willing to use, to play hardball, to deny these minerals, to show unhappiness with policies of other countries,\" said Herbst, senior director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. \"And so we have to be prepared for that, and Ukraine can help us resolve at least part of this problem.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/04/04/ukraine-raw-minerals-us-deal/82775688007/", "title": "Ukraine signs agreement giving the US access to its rare minerals", "text": "Reuters and Janet Loehrke\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAfter months of intense negotiations, Ukraine signed an agreement Wednesday that gives the U.S. preferential access to Ukrainian mineral resources in return for American investment in the war-torn country's reconstruction.\n\nThe deal is a full economic partnership that will allow President Donald Trump to negotiate with Russia on a stronger basis, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday.\n\nThe agreement was due to be signed in February, but collapsed after a heated exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on how to end the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\nThe accord establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in three-year-old war, according to Reuters.\n\nMapping Ukraine's crucial raw mineral deposits\n\nWith more than 5% of the world's total mineral resources, Ukraine is a top 10 global provider because of its diverse geological zones, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nUkraine has 20,000 mineral resources of 116 different types, 3,055 (15%) of which were active before Russia's invasion in 2022.\n\nWhat's behind the US deal\n\nOne of the main drivers of the U.S. pressure campaign to lock Ukraine into a minerals deal is the Trump administration’s focus on China, which is the world's largest producer of rare earth minerals. China has slowly grown to control the entire sector over the past 30 years.\n\nThe minerals are crucial in a variety of industries such as health care, power generation, petroleum refining and consumer electronics, and they can play a crucial role in national security, energy independence, environmental future and economic growth, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nUkraine's vital minerals and other resources\n\nUkraine has deposits of 22 of the 34 minerals identified by the European Union as critical, according to Economy Ministry data. That includes industrial and construction materials, ferroalloy, precious and non-ferrous metals, and some rare earth elements.\n\nKyiv says these resource represent trillions of dollars of untapped mineral wealth, but industry experts say it could take years for investors to make significant profits from a sector reeling from war and chronic underinvestment.\n\nIn addition to minerals, the agreement includes sharing oil and natural gas resources, according the BBC, which said Ukraine will retain ownership while giving the U.S. joint access.\n\nThe BBC also reported it appears Trump will no longer demand Ukraine repay the U.S. for American military aid received during the war.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Francesca Chambers, Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSOURCE Reuters; U.S. Geological Survey; Ukrainian Geological Survey; USA TODAY research", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/28/trump-raw-earth-deal-ukraine-zelenskyy/80856299007/", "title": "Trump: US deal with Ukraine's Zelenskyy over 'raw earth' looks to be ...", "text": "President Donald Trump wants Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make a deal with the U.S. over the country's \"raw earth\" minerals.\n\nBut what does that actually mean?\n\nZelenskyy came to the White House on Friday under expectations he and Trump would reach a deal with Ukraine that would put 50% of future revenue from mineral resources, oil, natural gas, and other materials into a joint Ukraine-U.S. investment fund.\n\nTrump described the potential deal on Friday, saying, \"We don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it’s going to be a lot of money,” Bloomberg reported.\n\nPotential profits from the deal could satisfy Trump's request that Ukraine repay the U.S. for its help defending the country since Russia's invasion in 2022.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Trump described the deal as involving \"raw earth.\" Earlier this week, Trump suggested Zelenskyy would sign an agreement in Washington on Friday. \"We've pretty much negotiated our deal on raw Earth and various other things,\" said Trump on Tuesday.\n\nAnd again on Friday, Trump said the deal covers minerals vital to industry. \"This has just about every component of the raw Earth that we need for computers for all of the things we do. This puts us in great shape,\" he said The National News Desk reported.\n\nUkraine doesn't currently produce any rare earth metals but, according to Ukraine's Institute of Geology, possesses large deposits of such minerals, including lanthanum, cerium, neodymium and yttrium. Detailed data about those reserves is classified, Reuters reported.\n\nUkraine also has one of the largest lithium reserves in Europe – amounting to about 3% of global total reserves – but is not currently mining it, NPR reported. Lithium is used in batteries for smartphones and many other devices.\n\n'Raw earth': What does it mean?\n\nSo, what is \"raw earth\"? Well, that's a good question. Here's a possible answer. Rare-earth metals and elements such as lanthanum and lutetium are raw materials of which there are limited concentrated deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nWhat President Trump may be doing is using a shorthand phrase of \"raw earth\" to cover all the rare-earth elements and raw materials covered by the proposed agreement.\n\nThat could be a suitable description because Ukraine has a lot of raw materials on its own. “About 5% of all the world’s ‘critical raw materials’ are located in Ukraine, which occupies only 0.4 percent of the Earth’s surface,” Ukraine’s deputy minister of environmental protection and natural resources, Svetlana Grinchuk, said in 2022, reported CNBC.\n\nThe deal does involve \"raw material\" that is excavated from the earth and \"is shipped somewhere to be refined,\" Michael Tamvakis, a professor of commodity economics and finance at City St. Georges University of London.\n\nStill, that \"doesn't sound like the appropriate term,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nWhether the deal will come about remains to be seen before the planned joint press conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, which was canceled after a discordant meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance told Zelenskyy he was being \"disrespectful\" to Trump and should be thanking the U.S. for its support, rather than lecturing it on the cause of the war.\n\nTamvakis doesn't think the deal is doomed. \"I think right now there will be some cooling off\" and perhaps subsequent talks \"will be in the hands of people who are lower ranked,\" he said.\n\nRegardless, any execution of the agreement remains problematic. Some of the resources are located in lands currently occupied by Russia, he said.\n\nAnd to make the operation truly worthwhile there needs to be refineries nearby. Currently, most mined resources are sent to China to be refined, Tamvakis said. \"So I think it requires substantial investment,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Joey Garrison, and Mary Walrath-Holdridge.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X:mikegsnider & @mikegsnider.bsky.social & @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

This makes mining, separating and purifying them “not only highly labor intensive” but may also “have adverse health effects”.\n\nThe group of 17 metals is “critical for both human and national security”, Brookings added. They are used in a breadth of electronics including computers and smartphones, as well as in renewable energy technologies such as solar panels and batteries. This is alongside national defence uses like jet engines and GPS equipment.\n\nNeodymium, dysprosium and terbium, for example, are used in the “permanent magnets required to drive motors in electric vehicles, offshore wind turbines and increasingly within robotics”, said WSJ. Experts suggest “they are going to become more crucial as the drive to adopt clean-energy technology grows”.\n\nIndeed, the need for rare-earth minerals is growing. Global demand reached 125,000 tonnes in 2021, and is forecast to reach 315,000 tonnes by 2030, Brookings added. By 2050, the EU estimates demand for lithium will be 57 times greater than today, and “raw materials will soon be as important as oil and gas”, according to Politico.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhy do other nations want to challenge China’s dominance?\n\nChina aims to switch from being the largest producer and refiner of rare-earth minerals and become “the world’s major high value-add manufacturer” of clean energy technologies, said Brink News. Countries around the world, however, “have a singular purpose: to loosen China’s grip” on the market, said Quartz.\n\nThe key reason is that China is threatening an export ban on rare-earth minerals, in response to the US imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports. Such a ban could be “quite damaging”, said UnHerd, with the threats “likely to push Western countries to find new sources of supply”.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is “clearly concerned about supply”, said Rana Foroohar in the Financial Times (FT), and his administration “flagged the importance of securing more critical minerals” in a White House supply chain report published in 2021.\n\nOther countries including European states, as well as Japan and Australia, are also engaging in a “huge realignment in trade” by striking several deals, according to Quartz. European and US companies struck an agreement two years ago, while another deal sees ores mined in Canada undergo domestic processing before being shipped to Norway. Japan, meanwhile, has increased investment in Australian company Lynas, “further expanding the Japan-Australia rare earth supply chain”.\n\nCan African nations pose a threat to China?\n\nThe global race also “opens up a window of opportunity” for African nations given their “rich endowment of key commodities”, said Brookings. These countries can take advantage of the race for new sources of rare-earth minerals to “bring in much-needed revenue to finance core socioeconomic objectives and reduce poverty”.\n\nBut there is currently much work to be done. “Africa’s full potential in rare earths is largely untapped given low levels of exploration,” added Brookings. Mining exploration budgets in sub-Saharan Africa were the second lowest in the world in 2021 and grew at the slowest rate (12%) versus the likes of Canada (62%), Australia (39%) and the US (37%). The majority of exploration also “continues to be concentrated in gold, rather than rare earths”.\n\nTo “join strategic global value chains and utilize revenue inflows”, African nations should take a number of measures. First, according to Brookings, they should “strengthen tax policy to maximize revenue collection”. They should also “leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area to maximise value addition”. Finally, they should “use resources strategically to build strong trade partnerships”.\n\nBy following this guidance, African countries can, “as a bloc”, forge partnerships with those seeking to move away from reliance on China and “build more resilient rare earths value chains”.", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/26/what-are-rare-earth-metals/80497955007/", "title": "What are rare earth metals and why are they in demand?", "text": "Jason Neely and Eric Onstad\n\nReuters\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine have agreed on the terms of a draft minerals deal central to Kyiv's push to win Washington's support as President Donald Trump seeks to rapidly end the war with Russia, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal could open Ukraine's vast mineral wealth to the U.S., but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused to sign an earlier draft of a minerals agreement as Washington sought rights to $500 billion in the country's natural wealth.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 elements, including 15 silvery-white metals called lanthanides, or lanthanoids, plus scandium and yttrium.\n\nWhat are they used for?\n\nThey are used in a wide range of products, including consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), aircraft engines, medical equipment, oil refining, and military applications such as missiles and radar systems.\n\nWhich country is the biggest producer?\n\nChina accounts for about 60% of global mine production and 90% of processed and permanent magnet output. Beijing sets quotas on output, smelting, and separation, which are closely monitored as a barometer of global supply.\n\nWhat are the names of these elements?\n\nIn their periodic table order, they are: scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium.\n\nWhich ones are most common?\n\nLanthanum and cerium are among the most common rare earth metals.

No one in their right mind actually believed him, but the MAGA blind faith has given the new administration room to play word games instead of crafting real foreign policy.\n\nTake last Friday’s debacle at the White House. Trump and Vice President JD Vance ‒ neither of whom has ever set foot in Ukraine or seen actual war combat ‒ ambushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, treating a wartime leader like a prop in their political theater. As if on cue, Secretary of State Marco Rubio then tried to justify the embarrassing behavior of the White House.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, he tried to echo Trump’s bravado about making deals ‒ repeating the idea that Trump is a world-class negotiator. But then he admitted the truth: There’s no actual peace deal with Russia on the table.\n\n\"Maybe they don't want a deal, either. We don't know. But we haven't talked to them in three years,\" Rubio said. \"Can we try to sit with them and figure out whether there’s any – what are the Russian demands? Under what conditions would the Russians be willing to stop this war?\"\n\nYet, the Trump camp keeps hammering the word “deal” into every sentence, applying it to rare earth minerals, Russia, Ukraine, imaginary agreements between Kyiv and Moscow. The repetition is deliberate. The confusion is the point. This isn’t just sloppy messaging: It’s a classic authoritarian tactic straight out of the Russian propaganda playbook. Flood the conversation with contradictions, repeat vague slogans until facts lose meaning, and train people to accept conflicting statements without question.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThere is no peace deal ‒ because Russia doesn't want one\n\nI’ll set aside the fact that you can’t make deals with Russian leaders ‒ because they will break them. Even in the case of a ceasefire, they will regroup and attack again, whether foreign peacekeepers are present or not.\n\nAnd they certainly won’t care if American companies show up to extract rare earth minerals.\n\nLet’s be clear: There is no peace deal with Russia in place now. Even if the U.S. president offered dictator Vladimir Putin everything and invited him for a tango for the whole world to see, Russia wouldn't be interested in making a deal ‒ especially one that leads to lasting peace.\n\nTrump has no influence over Putin. He can only continue to humiliate himself, Americans, NATO and the very image of the United States ‒ a country that has spent decades building its reputation as the world’s toughest yet democratic country.\n\nUkraine rare earth minerals deal has nothing to do with peace\n\nThe Trump administration insists that the rare earth deal was a step toward peace, but it has nothing to do with peace. It’s an economic treaty that has nothing to do with the country during an active war ‒ because no company will invest in a country that is bombed daily.\n\nAnd it’s not going to stop Russia from continuing its war against Ukraine or other neighboring countries.\n\nWhite House officials are desperately trying to reframe Russia’s war as a fight for resources. But they either know the truth and ignore it ‒ or they’re simply that ignorant.\n\nThis isn’t a war over minerals. It’s an imperial war of expansion and domination.\n\nRussia is willing to flatten cities, destroy entire countries and obliterate infrastructure ‒ including factories. They are actively mining Ukrainian fields, the very lands that sustain Ukraine’s global economic importance. No one can use these fields ‒ not Russians, Ukrainians or Americans. Ukraine is now the most mined country in the world.\n\nAnd you certainly can’t extract rare earth minerals from areas filled with explosives, the ones under Russian occupation or not protected by the air defense systems.\n\nAt any rate, the Pentagon confirmed Tuesday that Trump has stopped U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n\nTrump's endgame: Blame Zelenskyy for a nonexistent deal\n\nIt seems the ultimate goal of the Trump administration is to shift the blame onto the Ukrainian president ‒ to accuse him of refusing a so-called peace deal.\n\nBut Zelenskyy reiterated Tuesday his country's commitment to peace: \"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\"\n\nPerhaps even more telling is this: Trump and his administration are too cowardly to address the Ukrainian people directly. Not once have they spoken to those who are actually fighting and dying for their country. When did Republicans forget that in a true democracy, it is the people ‒ not the politicians ‒ who fight for their nation, who sacrifice for it and who ultimately decide its fate?\n\nIf the United States is invaded, it’s going to be Trump voters, not Trump himself, who will go fight on the front lines.\n\nIf anyone in Trump’s circle had even an ounce of courage, they would look Ukrainians in the eye and admit the truth: There is no deal.\n\nAnd that the only thing they care about is cozying up to regimes like Russia ‒ nations that won’t judge them, even if they drag the United States into complete darkness.\n\nAnastasiia Marushevska, co-founder of theUkrainian nonprofit PR Army of communication experts, is editor-in-chief at Ukraїner International, host of \"Decolonisation\" podcast.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/25/rare-earths-trump-ukraine-putin/80054133007/", "title": "What are rare earths and why does Trump want them?", "text": "As President Donald Trump works to strike a deal to end the three-year war in Ukraine, an important piece of the negotiations for the president has revolved around accessing rare earth elements from the war-torn country as compensation for American military support.\n\nDuring a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in the White House on Monday, Trump said that the agreement was “very close to a final deal.”\n\n“The agreement's being worked on now . . . they're very close to a final deal. It'll be a deal with rare earths and various other things,” he said, adding that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy might come to the Oval Office as early as this week to sign the agreement.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump wrote that during the Group of Seven summit earlier in the day, he had emphasized the importance of the “vital ‘Critical Minerals and Rare-Earths Deal’ between the United States and Ukraine.”\n\n“This deal, which is an 'Economic Partnership,' will ensure the American people recoup the Tens of Billions of Dollars and Military Equipment sent to Ukraine, while also helping Ukraine’s economy grow as this Brutal and Savage War comes to an end,” he wrote.\n\nConcurrently, he said he was “in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War.” Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022,\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. opposed a Europe-backed U.N. resolution on Monday, condemning Russian aggression and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.\n\nWhat are the rare earths and why does Trump want them?\n\nThe rare earths are a group of 17 metals that are key ingredients in things such as magnets, batteries, aircrafts and medical imaging and are used in many manufactured items, from cell phones to cars.\n\nCrucial in a variety of industries such as health care, power generation, petroleum refining and consumer electronics, they can play a crucial role in national security, energy independence, environmental future and economic growth, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nChina, with whom Trump has threatened a trade war, is the world's largest producer of rare earths.\n\nAbout 40% of Ukraine’s metal resources are now under Russian occupation, according to Reuters, which cited estimates by Ukrainian think-tanks We Build Ukraine and the National Institute of Strategic Studies.\n\nHow much did the U.S. spend on the war in Ukraine?\n\nSince Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago, Congress has appropriated $183 billion for Operation Atlantic Resolve and the broader Ukraine response, according to the government’s Ukraine Oversight Working Group, a federal oversight committee. In addition, the U.S. provided $20 billion in loans as part of the G7 nations extraordinary revenue acceleration loans initiative.In a Feb. 10 interview with Fox News, Trump said Ukraine had “tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earth” and that he wanted the “hundreds of billions of dollars” the U.S. was spending “back.”\n\n“I told them that I want the equivalent like $500 billion worth of rare earth. And they've essentially agreed to do that so at least we don’t feel stupid,” Trump said, without giving an explanation of where the figure came from.\n\nOn Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent presented Zelenskyy a minerals cooperation agreement calling for 50% of Ukraine’s mineral and natural resources revenues to go to the U.S. But Zelenskyy refused to sign the agreement as it included no security guarantees for Ukraine. A new agreement is currently being worked on.\n\n\"We're going to get our money back because it's just not fair,\" Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22.\n\nWhat is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s take on U.S. interest in rare earths?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, speaking to state TV Kremlin on Monday, said that a U.S.-Ukraine possible deal involving rare earth metals is not a concern for Russia, according to Reuters.\n\nPutin said that potential rare earth metals exploration deals could also be extended to deposits in territory in eastern Ukraine that Russia controls after three years of military action. He also offered the U.S. the opportunity for joint exploration of the country's rare earth metals deposits, as well as the supply of aluminum to the U.S. domestic market, under a future economic deal, reported Reuters.\n\nRussia has the world's fifth-largest reserves of rare earth metals, after China, Brazil, India and Australia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey data.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

On Sunday he said the tariff rate on semiconductors would be announced in the coming week, though he made room for flexibility with some companies.\n\nMonday's filing showed the investigations began April 1 and the tariffs would be imposed under the authority of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president such power to protect national security.\n\nThe U.S. relies heavily on Asian sources like Taiwan for semiconductors − which control electrical currents − and also gets the vast majority of its pharmaceutical ingredients and much of its production from abroad, especially India and China.\n\nTrump sees that reliance as a security issue and believes tariffs can bring more manufacturing to America. Drugmakers say the duties could create shortages and reduce access for patients. Even if they don't, the process would take considerable time.\n\nThe Trump administration just days ago unveiled some technology tariff exemptions that include most of the stiff levies Trump levied on Chinese imports such as smartphones, computers and flat screen televisions. The exemptions were a rare piece of good news for the battered financial markets, and U.S. stocks closed higher Monday.\n\nChina isn't backing down, steeply increasing its tariff on U.S. goods and choking off the flow of valuable, rare-earth metals and magnets into the U.S.\n\nToday's stock market news: Futures rise amid smartphone tariff exemption\n\nTrump ponders exemptions from auto tariffs\n\nTrump said he's considering temporary exemptions from his 25% tariffs on the auto industry to give car companies more time to transition to manufacturing in the U.S.\n\nTrump's remarks from the Oval Office came after his administration on April 11 excluded smartphones, computers and other electronics from his steep reciprocal tariffs in a move his economic aides said is only temporary.\n\n\"I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they're switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places,\" Trump said April 14. \"And they need a little bit of time, because they're going to make them here.\"\n\nAn exemption on some auto tariffs ‒ which include 25% levies on all foreign cars and light trucks as well as some auto parts ‒ could be a major reprieve for automakers as the industry grapples with tariffs that threaten to raise vehicle prices for American consumers. Stock shares of the three largest U.S. automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, shot up after Trump's comments.\n\nChina cuts off flow of minerals. Can US firms step in?\n\nChina has suspended exports of many rare-earth minerals and magnets crucial for automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world, the New York Times reports. Shipments have been halted from many Chinese ports while the Chinese government drafts a new regulatory system − one that could permanently prevent supplies from reaching American military contractors and other U.S. companies.\n\n“Drones and robotics are widely considered the future of warfare,” James Litinsky, chief executive of MP Materials, the sole U.S.-based rare-earth mining and processing firm, told the Times. \"Based on everything we are seeing, the critical inputs for our future supply chain are shut down.\"\n\nThe minerals themselves are not actually rare, but the ability to refine them at scale is, Litinsky said in a post on X. The company announced in January that it had begun commercial production of the magnets and plans to begin supplying magnets to General Motors and other manufacturers by year's end.\n\nChina, Vietnam trying to 'screw' US on trade, Trump says\n\nTrump accused China and Vietnam of working to “screw the United States” as leaders from the two communist-run nations signed deals April 14 to strengthen their trade alliance.\n\nAmid an escalating U.S.-China trade war, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vietnam's top leader, To Lam, met in Hanoi and reached new agreements on supply chains, cooperation over railways and other areas.\n\nTheir meeting came after Trump raised tariffs last week on imports from China to 145%, triggering retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. exports. Vietnam, meanwhile, is among the more than 75 countries that have engaged in negotiations with the Trump administration for trade deals to avoid steep reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"I don't blame China, I don't blame Vietnam. I see they're meeting today. Isn't that wonderful? That's a lovely meeting,\" Trump said, adding they're \"trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America?\"\n\nFinancial markets rally\n\nFinancial markets have struggled mightily in recent days, first with a string of announcements placing tariffs on products from certain nations such as Canada, China and Mexico, and on certain products such as steel and aluminum. In ensuing days the number of nations and products rapidly expanded, crushing investors and fueling turmoil in the bond markets.\n\nA series of temporary tariff rollbacks have brought some relief, but uncertainty has prompted concerns of inflation and a possible recession. Aided by the latest tech exemptions and a possible auto industry exemption, U.S. financial markets finished in positive ground Monday.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow closed up 0.78%, or 312.08 points, to 40,524.79; the broad S&P 500 added 0.79%, or 42.61 points, to 5,405.97; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.64%, or 107.03 points, to 16,831.48.\n\nChina position on US trade: 'We will never yield'\n\nChina has put civilian government officials in Beijing on “wartime footing” and ordered a diplomatic charm offensive aimed at encouraging other countries to push back against Trump’s tariffs, Reuters reports, citing four people familiar with the matter. Communist Party propaganda officials have played a leading role in framing China’s response, one of the people said, and government spokespeople posted defiant clips on social media featuring former leader Mao Zedong saying “we will never yield.”\n\nBureaucrats in the foreign affairs and commerce ministries have been ordered to cancel vacation plans and keep mobile phones switched on around the clock, two of the people said. Departments covering the U.S. have also been beefed up, they said.\n\n\"This trade war was started by the U.S. and imposed on China,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. \"If the U.S. really wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiations, it should stop applying extreme pressure. Any dialogue should be established on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.\" Read more here.\n\nAs part of a previously scheduled visit to Vietnam on April 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for stronger economic ties between the two countries, which said they have signed dozens of new agreements as they face severe U.S. tariffs.\n\n“The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,” Xi said, according to a story in the newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist Party. Xi also encouraged closer links on artificial intelligence and the green economy.\n\nTiny Lesotho, hit with onerous tariffs, cuts deal with Musk's Starlink\n\nLesotho, the small country in southern Africa that was the target of Trump's largest \"reciprocal'' tariffs, granted a license to provide satellite internet services to Starlink, a company owned by Trump ally Elon Musk.\n\nThe Lesotho Communications Authority said the license would be in place for 10 years. The decision was condemned by civil society groups such as SECTION 2, which advocates for domestic ownership.\n\nLesotho, with 2 million people and a gross domestic product of a little over $2 billion, hopes to negotiate with the Trump administration over the 50% tariffs it faces, which are now under a 90-day pause.\n\nBillionaire Trump backer: Wait 90 days before bringing 'hammer down' on China\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman, a Trump supporter now at odds with the president over tariffs, called April 13 for a three-month pause on China. Ackman lauded Trump for showing \"considerable flexibility\" and understanding the challenges U.S. companies face in adapting to the tariffs so rapidly.\n\nChina is under pressure to negotiate a deal whether the tariffs take effect immediately or in three months, Ackman said in a post on X. The pause would provide U.S. businesses with time to make supply- chain adjustments while giving China a chance to negotiate a trade deal in good faith, Ackman said.\n\n\"If China does not cooperate and negotiate a deal that makes sense for our country, President Trump can bring the hammer down in 90 days,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nEconomy will likely slow: Near-standstill or recession likely despite Trump tariff pause: Survey\n\nExperts forecast little economic growth this year\n\nForecasters have a bleak outlook on the U.S. economy because of Trump’s escalating trade war − and they see the odds of a recession as a tossup. The experts predict the economy will nearly stall in 2025, growing 0.8%, down from their projection of 1.7% just last month, according to the average estimate of 46 economists surveyed by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators on April 4 and April 7. They estimated there’s a 47% chance of a recession, up from 25% in February.\n\nThe poll was conducted after Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries April 2 but before he announced a 90-day pause on duties as high as 50% on all nations other than China on April 9 and exemptions for many electronics products a few days later.\n\nA separate survey of 31 experts this week – 21 of whom responded the day Trump announced the 90-day pause – reveals a similarly dour view, according to the poll by the National Association of Business Economics. They expect the economy to grow just 0.7% this year. Read more here.\n\n− Paul Davidson\n\nIt's not just the experts who are worried about the economy\n\nTrump’s approval ratings on the economy and inflation have fallen after weeks of tariff policy twists and turmoil in the stock market, according to a new poll released April 13. The CBS News survey of 2,410 Americans found 44% approved of Trump’s handling of the economy and 40% approved of his handling of inflation, both down 4% from March 30. The president's overall approval rating dropped to 47% this month, down from 50% in March and 53% in February.\n\nMore than half of respondents − 59% − rated the state of the U.S. economy as either fairly bad or very bad, and 53% said they feel the economy is getting worse.

The moves have cheered Russia and unnerved traditional allies in western Europe.\n\nOn Ukraine, Trump said he is “working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.” Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians, as well as Russian soldiers, have been wounded or killed in the fighting that began in 2022 when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy agreed to negotiate with Russia after Trump doubled down on Friday’s Oval Office spat and on Monday night suspended shipments of U.S. arms to Ukraine, a critical link to keep Ukrainian troops supplied. Zelenskyy left without signing an agreement with Trump to grant the U.S. access to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Trump contends that the deal would protect Ukraine by linking U.S. business interests to the country.\n\nIn a social media post Tuesday, Zelenskyy praised Trump, expressed gratitude for U.S. support and promised to “make things right.”\n\n\"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday, describing their previous encounter as \"regrettable.\"\n\nWhat the war in Ukraine means for Americans: Sign up for USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine Crisis newsletter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}]}
