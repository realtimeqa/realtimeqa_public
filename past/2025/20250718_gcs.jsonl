He said he thought progress towards de-escalation would be made within hours.\n\nScores of people have been killed this week in violence in and around the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, pitting fighters from the Druze minority against government security forces and members of Bedouin tribes.\n\nReuters reporters heard warplanes swoop low over the capital and unleash a series of massive strikes mid-afternoon. Columns of smoke rose from the area near the defence ministry. A section of the building was destroyed, the ground strewn with rubble.\n\nA Syrian medical source said the strikes on the defence ministry killed five members of the security forces.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the Israeli military struck the entrance to the military headquarters in Damascus and a military target near the presidential palace.\n\nThe Israeli official said Syrian forces were not acting to prevent attacks on Druze and were part of the problem. Defence Minister Israel Katz said the Israeli military would \"continue to operate vigorously in Sweida to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely\".\n\nSharaa is facing major challenges to stitch Syria back together in the face of deep misgivings from groups that fear Islamist rule - mistrust exacerbated by mass killings of members of the Alawite minority in March.\n\nSyrian government troops were dispatched to the Sweida region on Monday to quell fighting between Druze fighters and Bedouin armed men but ended up clashing with the Druze militias.\n\nLate on Wednesday, the Syrian interior ministry and a Druze leader, Sheikh Yousef Jarbou, said a ceasefire had been reached.\n\nHowever, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajari, another Druze leader, said fighting should continue until Sweida is \"entirely liberated\". A ceasefire that was announced on Tuesday collapsed.\n\nSweida residents said they were holed up indoors. \"We are surrounded and we hear the fighters screaming ... we're so scared,\" said a resident of Sweida who was reached by phone.\n\nThe crack of gunfire interspersed by booms could be heard in the background. \"We're trying to keep the children quiet so that no one can hear us,\" the man added, asking not to be identified for fear of reprisals.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights said 169 people had been killed in this week's violence. Security sources put the toll at 300. Reuters could not independently verify the tolls.\n\nMinority\n\nDruze are followers of a religion that is an offshoot of Islam and are spread between Syria, Lebanon and Israel.\n\nFollowing calls in Israel to help Druze in Syria, scores of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday, linking up with Druze on the Syrian side, a Reuters witness said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli military was working to save the Druze and urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border. The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.\n\nU.S. Syria envoy Tom Barrack, who has praised Syria's new rulers and declared in May that peace was possible between Syria and Israel, condemned violence against civilians in Sweida.\n\n\"All parties must step back and engage in meaningful dialogue that leads to a lasting ceasefire. Perpetrators need to be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli Druze man Faez Shkeir said he felt helpless watching the violence in Syria. \"My family is in Syria - my wife is in Syria, my uncles are from Syria, and my family is in Syria, in Sweida, I don't like to see them being killed. They kicked them out of their homes, they robbed and burned their houses, but I can't do anything,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Reuters reporter said they had seen government forces looting and burning homes and stealing cars and furniture in Sweida. One man showed the reporter the body of his brother who had been shot in the head inside their home.\n\nA Syrian government statement on Wednesday said those responsible for lawlessness in Sweida would be held accountable. It said the government was committed to protecting the rights of the people in Sweida.\n\nSharaa has repeatedly promised to protect minorities.\n\n(Reporting by Khalil Ashawi in Damascus, Maya Gebeily, Yamam al-Shaar and Laila Bassam in Beirut, Steven Scheer and Crispian Balmer, Emily Rose in Jerusalem; Tala Ramadan, Ahmed Elimam, Elwely Elwelly in Dubai, Nayera Abdallah; Siyabonga Sishi in Majdal Shams, Jonathan Spicer in Istanbul, Trevor Hunnicutt, Katharine Jackson in Washington; Writing by Maya Gebeily and Tom Perry; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Ros Russell)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/07/syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-leaves-damascus-rebels-advance/76846432007/", "title": "Syria updates: Assad flees to Russia as rebels took control of capital", "text": "Syrian rebels seized Damascus on Sunday, and long-time President Bashar Assad fled the battle-scarred country amid the stunning collapse of his regime after 13 years of war.\n\nAssad and his family arrived in Russia, granted asylum \"on humanitarian grounds,\" Russian news agencies reported on Sunday, citing a Kremlin source. Rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist movement that was once an al-Qaeda affiliate, declared in a statement on state-owned TV that Syria was \"free from the tyrant\" Assad.\n\nThe rebel coalition said it was working to complete the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with executive powers to rule the ancient nation of more than 23 million people.\n\n\"The great Syrian revolution has moved from the stage of struggle to overthrow the Assad regime to the struggle to build a Syria together that befits the sacrifices of its people,\" it added in a statement.\n\nFrom eye doctor to brutal dictator: The rise (and fall) of Syria's Bashar Assad\n\nPresident Joe Biden was monitoring the events in Syria, the White House said. President-elect Donald Trump said the U.S. should not get involved.\n\nBiden on Sunday also said his administration is still trying to return Austin Tice to his family, bringing home the former U.S. Marine missing in Syria since 2012. His parents in a statement said they are \"eagerly anticipating seeing Austin walk free.\"\n\nAssad's ouster brings to a close nearly 25 years of his tight-grip rule, liberating Syria from a dynasty that has brutally controlled the country for a half-century and injecting fresh turmoil into a Middle East region already spilling over with warfare and political uncertainty.\n\nAssad's downfall also marks the latest development in one of the deadliest civil wars of the 21st century. The war began amid the 2011 \"Arab Spring\" pro-democracy protests that quickly led to the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi.\n\nAssad, aided by his brutal tactics and Russian support, held on until now.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm living this moment,\" Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP. \"We've been waiting a long time for this day. We are starting a new history for Syria.\"\n\nBiden addresses Austin Tice, an American missing in Syria since 2012\n\nThe collapse of Assad's regime is being watched closely by the family of Austin Tice, an American journalist who has been missing in Syria for more than a decade. His mother, Debra, said last week she was confident her son was alive, citing information she said came from a \"significant source,\" without elaborating.\n\nBiden, speaking Sunday, said his administration remains committed to returning Tice to his family.\n\n\"We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that,\" Biden said.\n\nTice, now 43, is a former U.S. Marine who was working as a freelance journalist in Syria ahead of his final year at Georgetown Law School when he vanished in 2012. He has not been heard from since.\n\nA video released a month after he disappeared shows him blindfolded and trembling as he's led up a hillside by armed men.\n\n“Oh, Jesus,\" Tice says in the video. “Oh, Jesus.\"\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Tice's parents, Marc and Debra Tice, said: \"We are eagerly anticipating seeing Austin walk free. We are asking anyone who can do so to please assist Austin so he can safely return home to his family.\"\n\nA senior U.S. government official pointed out the $1 million reward that was put out by the FBI in 2022, recognizing the 10th anniversary of his kidnapping.\n\n“The United States Government is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading directly to the safe location, recovery, and return of Austin Bennett Tice,” according to the FBI's website.\n\nOfficial: Chemical weapons in Syria a 'top-tier priority'\n\nAfter rebel forces toppled Assad's government and seized control of Damascus, caring for the country’s stock of chemical weapons has become a \"top-tier priority\" for the U.S., a senior administration official told reporters during a National Security Council call on Sunday.\n\nThe efforts include working with other partner countries in the region, as well as other Syrian groups as they work through the transition. But there are no plans to deploy the U.S. military to help with the task, according to the official.\n\nAssad's regime repeatedly used chemical weapons against the rebels and his people during the civil war, according to human rights monitors, and U.S. officials. Syria says it has destroyed its stocks, but if the munitions remain it is unclear who will gain control over them.\n\nAt a U.N. Security Council briefing Thursday on Syria's claim, U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu said Syria's assertion could not be fully verified. Nakamitusu cited 19 \"unresolved issues\" in the country’s declaration.\n\n“I reiterate that this is extremely worrying,” Nakamitsu said.\n\n75 targets hit in US strike on Syria against ISIS\n\nWith Biden's authorization, a strike on a “significant gathering” of ISIS fighters was launched Sunday which hit 75 targets. The strike also dropped 140 munitions on the site, a senior administration official said during a National Security Council call on Sunday with reporters\n\nThe official did not offer precise details of the targets saying an assessment of the strike had been completed yet.\n\nISIS has been trying to reconstitute in a broad area known as the Badiya Desert in Syria, according to the official.\n\n“We have worked to make sure they cannot do that. And so, when they try to gather, when they try to train, and we see it, which we do, we take them out,” he said.\n\nThere happened to be a “fairly broad gathering” and the president made a decision to launch a strike, the official said.\n\nBiden: U.S. forces launched precision strikes in Syria targeting ISIS\n\nBiden said Sunday that the fall of Damascus has heralded a period of “risk and uncertainty,” and that the U.S. will work with its partners and the stakeholders to “seize an opportunity” and manage the risk. He said the Islamic State − ISIS − might try to take advantage of the political chaos to create a haven for terrorists.\n\n“We will not let that happen,\" Biden said. He said U.S. forces on Sunday conducted a dozen precision strikes within Syria, targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives.\n\nThe U.S. will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition to an independent and sovereign Syria, he said.\n\nU.S. to maintain presence in eastern Syria\n\nU.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Sean Savett said Biden was \"closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners.\"\n\nDaniel Shapiro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said Sunday that the U.S. will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of ISIS, which had gained a foothold in Syria before essentially being driven out by U.S. and coalition forces in 2019.\n\nShapiro said the U.S. plans to maintain its presence in eastern Syria, and he called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and to respect international norms.\n\n“We remain focused on ensuring that ISIS cannot regroup and pose a threat again, either regionally or globally,” Shapiro said.\n\nSyrian prime minister offers olive branch to rebels\n\nUnverified footage published on social media appeared to show residents of Damascus and other cities pouring onto the streets, dancing and chanting, \"Assad is gone.\" Rebels said they would swiftly free political prisoners.\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said he wants Syria to be a \"normal country that builds good relations with its neighbors and the world.\" He said he wouldn't flee, wants to peacefully transfer power, and is willing to work with any new leadership chosen by the people.\n\n\"I am in my home, I did not leave it because I belong to this country,\" he said.\n\nTrump says US should stay out of Syrian chaos\n\nTrump said in a post on X and his social media platform that the U.S. should have nothing to do with the war in Syria.\n\n\"THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,\" he wrote. \"LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED.\" Trump later followed that post up by saying Assad had fled Syria because Russia was no longer willing to protect him. Russia, he said \"lost all interest because of (its war in) Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Assad is gone,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat's happening in Syria?\n\nHours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting.\n\nThe fall of Homs came after a new Syrian rebel offensive that started about 10 days ago. It gave insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from a coastal region that's key to the power of Assad's Alawite sect. The Alawites are a Muslim minority group who have ruled Syria for decades.\n\nHoms is also where Assad's Russian allies, who enabled him to stay in power during a 13-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 300,000 civilians, have a naval base and air base. Russia provided Assad's government with vital air cover. Assad was also propped up by Iranian-backed militants including Hezbollah fighters.\n\nBut analysts say that Assad was effectively left to fend for himself because Russia was distracted by its war in Ukraine and Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been under intense pressure from an Oct. 7-related conflict with Israel.\n\nSights on Damascus: Syrian rebels claim key city of Homs\n\nWhat do we know about Bashar Assad?\n\nAssad inherited Syria's leadership from his father Hafez, a powerful military dictator who leaned heavily on the nation's feared security services to crush dissent and suppress all challenges to his rule.\n\nWhen the younger, Western-educated Assad, who studied to be a dentist, took over from his father in 2000 there were hopes Syria might chart a new reformist course for its citizens and ties with the international community.\n\nThose hopes faded fast.\n\nWhat began as a series of hopeful pro-democracy protests in Syria in 2011 ballooned into a devastating and intractable conflict that contributed to one of the most severe refugee crises since World War II.\n\nAssad regime punctuated by violence, torture\n\nSyria's war has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, displaced millions, and helped spur the rise – then entrenchment, then toppling – of the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, humanitarian groups, and Syria watchdogs, Assad's violence has taken many forms: imposing starvation sieges on rebel-held areas; repeatedly bombing, with Russian assistance, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure; arresting and torturing thousands of activists, bloggers, and civilians, then holding them at secret prisons deep underground, where they languish without trial.\n\nHe has also allegedly used chlorine bombs and sarin gas — chemical weapons — against opposition fighters, killing children and civilians.\n\nAssad's downfall: What happens next in Syria?\n\nAssad's toppling raises hard-to-answer questions about what comes next for Syria. Early reports indicated Assad fled to Russia. Moscow has been known to give shelter to exiled authoritarians and dictators. The two countries have a bond shaped by their opposition to the West during the Cold War and nurtured by Moscow's more recent attempt to have a more assertive foreign policy on the world stage.\n\nGeir Pederson, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, called it a \"watershed moment.\"\n\n\"To those displaced, this moment renews the vision of returning to homes once lost,\" he said in a statement. \"To families separated by war, the beginnings of reunions bring hope. To those unjustly detained, and the families of the detained and the missing, the opening of prison doors reminds us of justice’s eventual reach.\"\n\nMohammed Albasha, founder of Basha Report, a Virginia-based consultancy specializing in Middle East affairs, said the critical question for Syria is how effectively the rebels can establish control and manage the transition of power.\n\n\"Will Syria follow the path of Libya, descending into prolonged chaos? While many questions linger about the nation's future, one thing seems certain: today likely marks the end of the Assad regime.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/05/29/syria-sectarian-war-spreads/2370085/", "title": "Syria's deepening sectarian war bleeds across borders", "text": "Oren Dorell and Ahmed Kwider\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n%22The war is spreading to Jordan%2C Lebanon%2C Iraq as we speak%22\n\nObama administration is seeking to hold peace talks in Geneva\n\nSyrian rebels are getting support from powerful sheikdoms\n\nAMMAN, Jordan — The Syrian civil war is increasingly drawing in nations across the Middle East, a regionwide conflict that threatens to pit world powers against each other.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Nations Human Rights Council pushed through a resolution to investigate the abuses of the Syrian regime, over the objections of the regime's ally Russia, who insisted the West was making matters worse.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry continued his travels in the region, trying to get all parties to agree to a peace conference in Geneva in the next few weeks. But councils representing the Syrian rebels again refused to join, demanding representatives of Bashar Assad's regime be banned.\n\nThis came in a week when Israel warned Russia it may use airstrikes to prevent Syria from activating sophisticated missile systems that Moscow says it is sending to Syria, home of Russia's only port on the Mediterranean. Early Thursday, Lebanese TV quoted Assad as saying the first shipment of Russian missiles has arrived in Syria. He made the comments in an exclusive interview, which was to air later in the day on Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar TV.\n\nOn Monday, the European Union lifted its embargo of sending arms to the rebels and could later decide to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, a leading proponent of arming the rebels, U.S. Sen. John McCain, arrived this week in rebel-held territory in Syria on a surprise visit to offer his support.\n\nIn a war that is now clearly pitting the two main branches of the Islam — Sunni and Shiite Muslims — against one another, the dithering and differences between world powers is bringing about a desperate situation, according to experts.\n\n\"The war is spreading to Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, as we speak, and will only spread more. It's a regional sectarian war, where Turkey, the Gulf states and Iran, as well as the U.S., EU countries and Russia, other countries, are backing factions,\" says Andrew Parasiliti, a former foreign policy adviser to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and editor of Al-Monitor.com, a Middle East news and analysis website.\n\n\"The sooner regional peace can coalesce around diplomacy, the better. ... If this conference fails, the Sunni-Shia conflict will probably get worse.\"\n\nCENTURIES OF CONFLICT\n\nWhether the battle will be contained to Syria alone is in doubt now that Islam's two major strands have taken sides against one another, threatening to spark a wider war that is centuries in the making between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.\n\n\"There is great fear over a massive sectarian war starting. If it does, the entire region will turn into a genocidal war, engulfing everyone,\" says Samir al-Ibrahim, 55, secretary-general of the Syrian Free Religious Scholars Association and a Sunni Muslim in Idlib, Syria.\n\nSunni Muslims who include the royal families of the Persian Gulf oil sheikdoms, have banded behind the rebels, who as Sunnis are the majority in Syria. The royal family of Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been funneling arms and cash to rebels, and Sunni Muslims who dominate al-Qaeda have dispatched fighters to the front.\n\nAssad has appealed to the Shiites, who are helping him hang on to his regime. The Shiite theocracy of Iran has deployed officers and fighters from its Revolutionary Guards and the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hezbollah, which has fought two wars with Israel from its base in Lebanon, is pouring militants into Assad's forces.\n\nReligious leaders from both Islamic branches in Sunni-dominated Egypt and Shiite-heavy Iraq have denounced each other for killing Muslims. Arab capitals have expressed fears that restive members of one sect or the other will erupt in the streets as they did in Bahrain during the Arab Spring of 2011.\n\nAlready, the fighting has bled across Syria's border with Lebanon, where Lebanese Alawites are fending off attacks from Sunni citizens of the same nation, leaving several people dead. Rockets have been fired back and forth between Turkey and Syria and Iraq.\n\nVali Nasr, dean of John Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, says the signs are there for a multination hot war and the Obama administration needs to act more forcefully to prevent it.\n\nThe Obama administration has resisted getting involved in the conflict \"and has not seen this as vital to our national security interests,\" Nasr says. \"That's becoming a more difficult position to maintain.\"\n\nThat's because multiple recent developments in Syria have made the two-year civil war a more immediate threat to the United States, its allies in the region, Europe and beyond, Nasr and other analysts say.\n\n\"The longer this conflict goes on the more chances it has of spilling over,\" he says.\n\nSUNNI VS. SHIITE\n\nThe schism that gave birth to the Sunni and Shiite divide occurred in the seventh century soon after the death of Islam's prophet Mohammed.\n\nSome Islamic leaders took the position that is was legitimate for Mohammed's successor to be chosen through consultation, and they selected the father of Mohammed's wife to be caliph, or leader of the Muslim world. Others believed Mohammed intended his cousin and son-in-law Ali, a blood relative, to be his rightful heir.\n\nThe disagreement led to war. Ali was killed as were his two sons. The two branches flourished as the Shiites, translated roughly as \"the followers of Ali,\" and the Sunnis, \"the people of the tradition of Mohammed and the consensus of the Ummah,\" or the Islamic world.\n\nOver the centuries, there were many conflicts. The Sunnis achieved dominance in numbers, wealth and power. The Sunnis of the Ottoman Empire based in modern-day Turkey swept through the Arab world in the Middle East and controlled the caliphate for centuries until World War I.\n\nThe victorious allied powers divided up the empire into nations, turning power over to their favored tribes and leaders in newly created counties such as Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia -- but they also threw together Sunnis and Shiite communities and largely left Sunnis in positions of power.\n\nToday, Sunnis are the majority in most Muslim countries, except in Iraq, Lebanon, Bahrain and Iran. Syrian leader Bashar Assad's Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.\n\nASSAD 'MUST GO'\n\nWhen Assad launched his attacks against the Syrian people, his Alawite-minority government was coming up against the Sunni majority. When his father, Hafez Assad, launched a similar slaughter against a Sunni uprising in the 1970s, the Arab world paid little notice.\n\nThe Arab Spring, which toppled dictators in several Arab world nations, gave rise to religiously affiliated parties that maintain direct relations with their brethren in other countries. And today, all eyes are on Syria.\n\nPresident Obama said two years ago that Assad \"must go.\" Yet the Obama administration's reliance on diplomacy without arming rebel fighters has helped put Russia, which for decades has been a minor player in the Middle East, in a position of expanding influence.\n\nThe United States has a history of tamping down conflicts in the Middle East before they become catastrophic. In the past two years, U.S. forces have intervened in Yemen to prevent that country from falling into the hands of al-Qaeda-linked rebels while negotiating the departure of Yemen's dictator, President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nIn Syria, where Russia has been supplying the Assad regime with heavy weapons, the Obama administration has provided rebels with only non-lethal aid, such as food and radios. The State Department says it has been coordinating Syria's political opposition, which remains fractured.\n\nLebanese Shiite fighters recently joined forces with Syrian forces in the rebel-held city of Qusair. Assad in recent weeks launched a major offensive to retake the town, which both loyalist and rebel forces consider key to obtaining supplies from the Mediterranean. Though scores of Hezbollah fighters reportedly died in the fighting, Assad's forces have secured the air base in Qusair and are in control of sizeable parts of the town, according to media reports.\n\nNow the Obama's administration's proposed solution is to join forces with Russia and co-sponsor a peace conference in June in Geneva between Syria's opposition leaders and the Assad regime.\n\nAt this stage in the conflict, \"the only thing it (a peace conference) does is rehabilitate Bashar al Assad, and locks in a moment when he is making some gains around the city of Homs,\" says Tony Badran, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"You lock in that moment and say, 'Let's negotiate a settlement.' \"\n\nThe Obama administration's stated goal, to negotiate Assad's departure, without giving aggressive lethal aid to the rebels or striking regime assets, such as air fields, \"is premised on a fantasy,\" Badran says. Assad \"is not going to leave voluntarily.\"\n\nMichael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says that without \"putting any skin in the game,\" the United States has little leverage in determining the outcome of the Syrian conflict.\n\nSingh sees Obama's Syria policy as \"symptomatic\" of U.S. policy across the Middle East and beyond, he says. \"We maintain the rhetoric that we have core interests in the Middle East, but our actions do not match our words. We're pulling back in the Middle East, not putting more resources in.\"\n\nWith Russia sending weapons, Iran sending fighters and key Arab states involved, a diplomatic solution will only succeed \"when all those parties around the table can arrive an outcome that for them is better than any likely alternatives,\" Singh says. \"Without armed intervention… you're going into those negotiations without leverage.\"\n\nSingh sees nothing wrong with Involving Russia in a potential solution, because that could prevent the Syrian conflict from becoming a proxy war between Russia and the United States, he says.\n\nBut \"right now, Assad and his allies think they can achieve a military victory outside of the negotiating table,\" Singh says. \"Once that prospect of a military victory is ruled out or reduced, the Assad regime might be willing to compromise,\" and the Russians would be willing to push them to do so, he says.\n\nParasiliti, the former foreign policy adviser, disagrees. He says diplomacy represents the best chance at stopping the conflict from engulfing the region.\n\nOther observers say the timing couldn't be worse.\n\nNasr says the current proposed conference is unlike the talks that ended the Bosnian war in 1995, which came after a two-week U.S.-led NATO bombing campaign that left Bosnian leader Slobodan Milosevic with little choice but to compromise.\n\nThen, \"there was a serious show of force that made our position credible,\" Nasr says. \"That's not the case here. The rebels are losing ground the week before we go into negotiations.\"\n\nThe flow of refugees and fighters across Syria's borders is exacerbating Sunni-Shiite tensions in neighboring countries that could engulf the region. It has already ignited fighting in neighboring Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Jordan.\n\nViolence in Iraq has also increased, with stepped-up suicide bombings attacks against Shiites reminiscent of the brutal Sunni-Shiite civil war that erupted months after the U.S. invasion in 2003.\n\nThen there is the wildcard of Israel.\n\nThe S-300 anti aircraft system promised by Russia are so advanced that U.S. ally Israel has pledged to destroy them as soon as they arrive in Syria, fearing they will interfere with Israel's ability to operate over Syria.\n\nIsrael has already launched three airstrikes inside Syria to blow up weapons shipments it believed were going to Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. It has exchanged fire with the Syrian military in the Golan Heights, and its government is warning Israelis of a possible \"surprise war\" on multiple fronts, prompting a run on gas masks.\n\n\"Clearly, this move is a threat to us,\" Israel's defense minister Moshe Yaalon said.\n\n\"The shipments have not been sent on their way yet,\" Yaalon said. \"And I hope that they will not be sent.\" But, \"if God forbid they do reach Syria, we will know what to do.\"\n\nOne reason given by the Obama administration for refusing to arm rebels to topple a man it wants gone is concern over who will replace him. Sunni foreigners allied with al-Qaeda have been streaming into the fight and winning some battles.\n\nThe Obama administration has designated one, the al-Nursra front, as a terror organization and is concerned it could get a hold of the chemical weapons in Assad's stock should his government be overrun. But the Syrian rebels refuse to denounce the group.\n\nAbu Said, 35, a Sunni member of the Revolution Council in Outer Damascus, a rebel group, says foreign fighters fill a void for anti-government fighters who are outgunned and out-funded by Assad's forces.\n\n\"There aren't even bullets or (rocket-propelled-grenade) shells, and when there are, the rebels can't afford them,\" Said says.\n\n\"As for al-Qaeda, it's not only our problem, but yours too,\" Said added referring to the West. \"You've allowed our country to become a feasible environment for everyone to operate, whether al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, or Iran's and Iraq's volunteers. The United States has neglected working to empower humane values in this region and limit hatred. Had the superpowers intervened to solve the conflict…sectarianism would have been nipped in the bud.\n\nAdnan Oumama, a hardline Lebanese Sunni sheikh, sees the strife already bleeding into his country.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the war in Syria has turned into a sectarian conflict pitting Shiites and Alawites against Sunnis,\" Oumama says.\n\nHundreds of fighters for the Iranian backed Lebanese Shiite militia, Hezbollah, have been killed in Syria in recent months, according to media reports. And \"Hezbollah's involvement in the nearby war has exacerbated sectarian tensions in Lebanon,\" Oumama said.\n\nOumama pointed to reports of ethnic cleansing in Syria and of Shiite Hezbollah and Iraqi factions fighting there along sectarian lines. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has kidnapped injured Syrian Sunni refugees while on their way to hospital. Tents of Syrian refugees have been burned. And this week, two rockets were fired against Dahieh, a Hezbollah's bastion in the capital, he said.\n\nThe rockets were fired after Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech on Saturday that his fighters \"will continue to the end of the road\" in their pursuit of victory on Assad's side in Syria.

His administration won significant backing from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nBut he has struggled to meet his aims as armed groups kept their weapons, sanctions remained and sectarian killings left minority groups afraid of his rule.\n\nIsrael, alleging Sharaa remains a jihadist, has declared south Syria off limits to his forces. It said a strike near the presidential palace in Damascus on May 2 was a warning that it would not let Syrian forces deploy south of the capital or allow any threat to Syria's Druze minority.\n\nThe challenges were demonstrated in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces in the coastal region, prompting a wave of revenge killing in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, from which Assad hailed.\n\nIt amplified fears about the jihadist roots of Syria's new ruling group despite Sharaa's promises of tolerance and accountability for the killings. Fears of a slide back towards authoritarian rule were hardened by a temporary constitution focusing power in his hands.\n\nSharia law in Syria?\n\nSharaa characterised Assad's defeat as a God-given victory.\n\nHe sidestepped interviewers' questions on whether he thought Syria should apply Islamic sharia law, saying it was for experts to decide. The temporary constitution strengthened its role.\n\nHe cited revolutionary legitimacy for his designation as interim president. He has said elections will take place, but that Syria needs up to five years to organise them properly.\n\nIn a Reuters interview at the presidential palace, Sharaa underlined his intention to turn the page on Assad's rule.\n\n\"My chest tightens in this palace. I'm astonished by how much evil against society emanated from every corner,\" he said.\n\nSharaa was born in Saudi Arabia, where he spent the first years of his life before moving to Syria. His father was an Arab nationalist, an ideology at odds with Sharaa's political Islam.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with PBS' Frontline, Sharaa said he was influenced by the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising against Israeli occupation, which began in 2000.\n\nHe returned to Syria from Iraq once the uprising began, sent by the leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State group in Iraq at the time, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, to build up al Qaeda's presence.\n\nSuicide bombers\n\nThe U.S. designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. It said the Nusra Front had carried out suicide attacks that killed civilians and espoused a violent sectarian vision.\n\nSharaa gave his first media interview in 2013, his face wrapped in a scarf with his back to the camera. He told Al Jazeera Syria should be run according to sharia law.\n\nIn his 2021 FRONTLINE interview, he faced the camera in a shirt and jacket. He said the terrorist designation was unfair and that he opposed the killing of innocent people.\n\nAsked about his views on the September 11 attacks at the time they happened, Sharaa said anybody in the Arab or Islamic world who said \"he wasn't happy would be lying to you, because people felt the injustice of the Americans in their support of the Zionists, their policies towards Muslims in general, and their clear and strong support of the tyrants in the region.\"\n\n\"But people regret the killing of innocent people, for sure,\" he said.\n\nThe Nusra Front had never presented a threat to the West, he said. Despite its al Qaeda ties, Nusra was regarded as relatively less heavy handed in dealings with civilians and other rebel groups than the Islamic State.\n\nSyria-Israel ties?\n\nTrump told reporters Sharaa said he would be willing to eventually join the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered 2020 agreement that saw the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalize relations with Israel. Syrian officials have signaled an openness to normalize under the right circumstances.\n\n\"I told him, 'I hope you’re going to join when it’s straightened out.’ He said, ‘Yes.’ But they have a lot of work to do,\" Trump said, according to a White House pool report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/12/14/syrias-revolutionary-flag-raised-at-paterson-city-hall/76965330007/", "title": "Syria's revolutionary flag raised at Paterson City Hall", "text": "Paterson, a longtime home for Syrian Americans, raised the three-star flag of the Syrian revolution before cheering crowds Saturday, six days after the toppling of the Assad regime in Damascus.\n\nHundreds of jubilant onlookers celebrated as the flag was hoisted at City Hall on Market Street. The banner, they said, symbolized a new beginning for a nation that was under brutal dictatorship for more than five decades and a civil war since 2011.\n\n“Today, we stand in solidarity because we celebrate victory,” said Mayor André Sayegh, standing behind a lectern on the front steps of the city government.\n\n“Victory for human rights,” he added. “Victory for justice. And victory for freedom.”\n\nStory continues below photo gallery\n\nPaterson may be the first American municipality to raise the revolution's flag since the stunning fall of President Bashar Assad, said Sayegh, who himself is of Syrian ancestry. He said the event was a show of support for the community and that he hoped to see democracy prevail in Syria.\n\nSayegh raised the flag alongside Mayor Mohamed Khairullah of Prospect Park, who was born in Syria, and who also spoke at the event.\n\n“Now is the day that we honor all of our martyrs,” Khairullah said. “We have never forgotten — we will never forget. You are our number one cause. Let’s honor all the martyrs, and all those who suffered, by raising the flag of the revolution.”\n\nPaterson had raised opposition flag before\n\nAssad’s toppling prompted celebrations across Syria and in diaspora communities around the world, including in New Jersey earlier this week.\n\nSaturday's event was not the first time that the city raised the opposition flag.\n\nIn the throes of an uprising and war, the city raised it in April 2017. At the time, an onlooker told NorthJersey.com that she hoped for a day “when we come here again and celebrate the independence from the Assad family.”\n\nThat day came Saturday.\n\nThey blared music from portable speakers while chanting, dancing in a circle and waving their own flags that they brought from home.\n\nAfter the event, cars paraded along the streets with passengers cheering and honking horns. An evening celebration was planned at Manchester Regional High School in Haledon.\n\nSyrian Americans said they were glad to be rid of a regime that ruled with repression. Many have seen loved ones imprisoned or killed at the hands of the Assad regime, especially during the bloody 13-year civil war that devastated and divided the country.\n\nMore than 500,000 Syrians were killed, and 14 million forced from their homes, during the war. About 90% of the victims were killed at the hands of Syrian regime forces and their allies, according to a United Nations analysis.\n\nSyrian Americans concerned about future\n\nBut even amid celebrations, Syrian Americans are concerned about the future.\n\nThey worry that another repressive regime or Islamic extremists will take power. Leaders of the rebel coalition vowed to embrace inclusiveness and tolerance for minority groups and other faiths — messages that many saw as hopeful. They worry, too, about foreign aggression in a power vacuum. Already, Israel, Turkey and the U.S. launched airstrikes to promote their interests, and Israel seized territory in Syrian-controlled areas of the Golan Heights.\n\nDespite those concerns, Syrian Americans hailed this moment in their history as a joyful one, giving them hope for the first time in a long time and a chance to live in freedom.\n\n“We’re all gathered here to celebrate, not just the end of a horrible chapter,” said Nawal Alqudah of Wayne, who emceed the event, “but a promise to rebuild, heal and honor those who have sacrificed for the dream of a free Syria.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/21/syrian-americans-visiting-their-home-country-rejoice-and-weep/77493064007/", "title": "Syrian Americans, visiting their home country, rejoice and weep", "text": "Mohamed Khairullah crossed the border into Syria and headed straight to the Rawdah Mosque in Aleppo, the city where he was born.\n\nHe walked by the skyscraping stone minaret, passed through the white columns and prayed under the dome roof over the great hall — the same hall where his grandfather, the late Sheikh Taher Khairullah, delivered sermons in the 1980s that cried for dignity and freedom under the fist of the Assad regime, inspiring the faithful to protest for their rights. Those sermons made his grandfather a target for execution, and the family had to flee the country in 1990.\n\nBut one feature of the mosque disturbed Khairullah on his Dec. 26 visit. In the mosque's former library, which a regime-aligned mufti had turned into a reception space, he spotted an old Syrian flag, the one that has been replaced across streets, homes and institutions with the three-starred flag of the revolution since the overthrow of President Bashar Assad a month ago.\n\nHe marched up and tore it off its staff before dropping it on the ground. Then, as an insult to the old regime, he stomped on it. It was an act of defiance after seeing his native country wither under decades of repression and a 13-year brutal civil war.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"I've been upset at the old regime since the time I had to be removed out of my house when I was almost 5 years old. So it’s a sense of closure. The desire to be free has manifested itself into reality. This regime is now behind us, and it’s a memory to us, really, something that we step on and we step over as we move forward. At least for me, I feel free.\n\n\"I wanted my family in Syria,\" he added, his voice breaking, \"to enjoy the same freedom that I enjoy in the United States, and now they have an opportunity to do so.\"\n\nFor half a century, the Assad family governed Syria as a totalitarian police state, crushing dissent, imprisoning and torturing critics and engaging in systematic corruption. In 2011, inspired by the Arab Spring, Syrians launched mass protests demanding democratic reforms. Assad responded with a brutal crackdown that spiraled into civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused 13 million to flee their homes.\n\nThe regime crumbled last month after rebel forces launched an astonishing offensive, capturing city after city over 12 days, facing little resistance from the Syrian Army. As they converged on Damascus on Dec. 8, Assad fled the capital city, boarding a plane to Russia. Opposition fighters declared victory and an end to Assad rule.\n\nSyrian Americans were rapt as events unfolded, feeling that an end to a long nightmare was finally within reach. When Assad was ousted, Syrians in the diaspora broke into celebrations across the world, including in New Jersey, where they joined parties, car parades and flag raisings. Some, like Khairullah, promptly booked travel, wanting to be in Syria to witness and revel in an end to war and a newfound freedom after years of estrangement and exile.\n\nIn interviews, they described emotional family reunions, triumphant visits to landmarks of the revolution, and sorrowful stops in places leveled by punishing airstrikes and gunfire.\n\n‘Happiness and relief’\n\nKhairullah rejoiced as he went through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing from Turkey into Syria, where he found his cousin waiting for him at the gate.\n\n\"We said 'Alhamdulillah,'\" he said, meaning \"thank God\" or \"praise be to God.\" \"We embraced each other and cried.\"\n\n“I’m choking up now just thinking about it — the fact that I knew I could walk in and not fear being kidnapped or being taken to prison and tortured, not having to worry about barrel bombs being dropped on us or Russian jets firing at us, or snipers targeting us while walking through the streets,” he said. “It was just a big sense of happiness and relief.”\n\nAlong the way, he met families that had been displaced during the war and were coming home. More than 115,000 people are estimated to have returned from countries including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon since the fall of the Assad regime, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Still, return is fraught with challenges in a country where destruction and poverty are severe. Many simply have no home left to return to.\n\nKhairullah, an assistant principal at Passaic County Technical-Vocational Schools, has lived in the U.S. since 1991 and served as mayor of Prospect Park for nearly 25 years. But he never forgot the plight of Syrians, and he organized several humanitarian missions to help refugees during the war. He also aided families who settled in the U.S. as refugees.\n\nNow he is calling for the U.S. to hold talks with Syria's new leaders and lift sanctions so people can begin the enormous task of rebuilding. The cost of reconstruction is uncertain. A 2019 report by the Carnegie Middle East Center estimated it between $250 billion and $400 billion. Another report, by the humanitarian group World Vision, put the total far higher, at more than $1.2 trillion.\n\nHugging a border guard\n\nWaddah Azzawi of Wyckoff had not visited Syria since he came to the United States in 2009. As an activist, he worried he would be targeted.\n\n“I was involved in every protest in the U.S., in lobbying and any activity against the regime,” said Azzawi, a pharmacist with a business in Prospect Park. “That put us directly under immediate threats, immediate danger. If any one of us would come back at that time, we would be arrested immediately, and you knew what would happen.”\n\nCrossing the border from Jordan on Dec. 29, he had tears in his eyes. “I hugged the first Syrian person I saw,” Azzawi said.\n\nThat person happened to be a border guard working for the rebel coalition now in power. Azzawi said he was overcome with joy to return, but also was moved by the guard's treatment of him and his fellow travelers, including his 15-year-old son, Moawya, and a friend, Hamid Imam.\n\nIn the past, crossing the border took hours. Assad's guards would interrogate travelers, rifle through belongings, demean them and solicit bribes. This time was different.\n\n\"He was very respectful,\" Azzawi said. \"He greeted us and said 'Welcome back.' He asked us if anyone had asked us for a bribe, because it was common practice in the old regime. He asked if anyone bothered us, and we said no. He told us, 'Welcome home. This is your country.'\"\n\nAfter entering, he headed to Damascus and walked the streets for hours. In the morning, he joined crowds in Umayyad Square, where people rallied in the early days of the pro-democracy uprising and which today is a central site for celebrations. There, he joined in singing, chanting and flag waving.\n\nAzzawi reunited with an uncle, but most of his family no longer lives in Syria, having been displaced or killed, he said. His former city, Deir ez-Zor in the north, is largely in ruins.\n\nImam, a former New Jersey resident now living in Colorado, also had not visited since 2009 because of his involvement in Syria’s pro-democracy movement, he said. Retuning, he said, was a longtime dream.\n\n“Every time we would have a rally, and it would end, I would say, ‘Next time I hope we meet in a free Syria,’” said Imam, who also aided displaced refugees.\n\nImam was also elated that no one interrogated him, detained him or asked for a bribe as he entered Syria. “No one asked me anything,” said Imam, a mental health and addiction counselor. “The only word was welcome.”\n\nFrom Damascus, he called his mother, surprising her with news of his visit. She was in disbelief, so he sent her a photo of his ticket to Jordan to prove that he had traveled there. She journeyed from her seaside village of Jableh to the capital, about four hours away, to reunite with her son. They posed for photos with the flag of the revolution with the word \"freedom\" written across it in Umayyad Square.\n\nImam then traveled through Syria’s main cities on what he called a “tour of freedom,” stopping at places where “the biggest protests took place, and the biggest sacrifices took place.” Along his trip, he waved flags in Freedom Square in Homs. He danced outside the citadel in Aleppo to revolutionary songs. He surveyed the destruction in Daraa, a city considered the birthplace of the revolution.\n\n\"I don't recall being happier than this,\" Imam said in a call from Syria. \"There's a lot of pride and relief, but there is also sadness to see destruction and the brutality of the regime. Every single spot you go through, you see buildings burned and destroyed, bullet marks, everything — schools, hospitals, houses, even one of the oldest mosques destroyed.”\n\nAfter years of war, poverty was stark, he said. Many were out of work and begging for money. Electricity and heat were lacking in the cold of winter, and people bundled in jackets and blankets. Posters of the missing, many of whom were detained by government forces and never heard from again, hung on public walls.\n\nA new year, new hope\n\nAs they welcomed a new year and new hope, Syrian Americans also acknowledged the difficulties ahead.\n\nThe Syrian civil war was among the most devastating conflicts of the century, with over half of the country’s population displaced and hundreds of thousands killed. Bombings and sectarian violence ravaged Syria. Before the war, about a third of Syrians lived below the poverty line. Today, more than 90% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the U.N.\n\nAlaa Kamnaksh, director of operations at the Syrian American Council and the American Coalition for Syria, organizations advocating for a democratic Syria, said she was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the country's future.\n\n\"They are going to need a lot of support,\" she said, \"and I think that support is going to come from easing of sanctions and a lot of communication with the international community that has showed goodwill and confidence. Keeping it in a silo is not going to allow for rebuilding and reopening and a transition to a democratic free Syria that we really want to see.\"\n\nThe U.S. on Jan. 6 issued a sanctions exemption, known as a general license, allowing some energy transactions and transactions with governing institutions. But it's unclear what will happen in the months ahead.\n\nThe Biden administration declined to take Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the Islamist rebel group that led the military offensive and heads the transitional government, off its list of designated terrorist groups. Biden indicated he will leave the decision to Trump, a move likely \"to substantially extend the timeline of powerful U.S. sanctions,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nHTS was placed on the list in 2018 due to its affiliation with the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate. It broke from the group years ago and has taken a more moderate approach. International observers are watching to see if its leaders keep their word to protect all ethnicities and faiths and form a power-sharing, inclusive government.\n\nAmid political upheaval, Syrians do not want to see a repeat of events that took place in other nations with Arab Spring uprisings, where new despotic leaders replaced old ones, and corruption and repression persisted.\n\nSyrians also must overcome ethnic and sectarian divides that hardened during the war. Many are also calling for accountability and justice for war crimes and theft by the Assad family and regime officials. In a regional tinderbox, Syria also grapples with the possibility of proxy clashes between Turkey and Israel, which sees Turkish support for Syrian groups as a security threat and has bombed its military and intelligence bases over the past month.\n\nKamnaksh hoped the international community would act to support a transition to democracy in Syria. In the meantime, many Syrian Americans are eager to go back and provide support and to invest, she said.\n\nAzzawi is among them. He felt the same optimism and inspiration as in the early days of the uprising, saying that \"we have that spirit again.\"\n\n\"We want to rebuild,\" he said. \"I am willing to do anything to help rebuild the country, emotionally, financially, whatever.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/14/israel-war-iran-live-updates/73318473007/", "title": "Israel updates: US says it would not be part of Iran attack response", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war and the Iran attack for Sunday, April 14. For the latest news, view our live updates file for Monday, April 15.\n\nOne day after Iran launched a historic missile and drone strike on Israel, the U.S. stressed Sunday that it is committed to defending its longtime ally − but it would not be a part of any responsive action that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government could take.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is not seeking escalation and does not want a war with Iran.\n\nA U.S. official who briefed reporters emphasized the U.S. was not involved in the initial Israeli strike that killed two Iranian commanders in Syria earlier this month and led to Iran's assault on Saturday. The official indicated President Joe Biden sought to take the temperature down in a call with Netanyahu on Sunday night.\n\nMeanwhile, top Israeli officials who huddled Sunday back retaliation but are divided on the method and timing, Reuters reported. Netanyahu's five-member War Cabinet was expected to meet again to weigh a response to the attack, which has ratcheted up global concerns about a wider Mideast war.\n\nWar Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz vowed Iran would pay. \"We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” Gantz said.\n\nIsrael and Iran have long been engaged in a so-called shadow war, with Iran using its proxies − militant groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Yemen's Houthi rebels − to target Israel, which has undertaken targeted assassinations inside Iran.\n\nBut the attack marked the first time that Iran directly targeted Israel from its own territory. The assault underscores how the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which began with the militants' attacks on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, risks spilling over into a broader regional conflict.\n\nWill it spark a wider war? Israel's long-simmering conflict with Iran moves out of the shadows.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" program that he would try to pass aid to Israel this week. The White House later confirmed that Biden convened a call Sunday afternoon with Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to discuss the urgent need for the House to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible.\n\n∎ The Israeli military lifted restrictions early Monday, saying children can return to school. Nationwide restrictions were enacted as Israel went on \"high alert\" Saturday and prohibited school activities and restricted gatherings to 1,000 people, the Times of Israel reported.\n\n∎ Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Sunday for the third time this weekend to review the combined operation by the United States, Israel, and their partners to defend Israel from attacks launched from Iranian territory and by Iran's proxies. Austin emphasized that while the United States does not seek escalation, it will continue to take all necessary action to defend Israel and U.S. personnel.\n\n∎ Biden spoke Sunday with Jordan's King Abdullah II and strongly condemned the attack launched by Iran that also threatened Jordan. Both leaders noted that they are monitoring the situation and will remain in close touch over the coming days.\n\n∎ The U.S. and Iran were in contact through Swiss intermediaries both before and after Iran's drone and missile attack, a senior Biden administration official told Reuters on Sunday. The official, who was not named, also said reports that Tehran gave regional countries 72 hours notice of the attacks were not true.\n\n∎ Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps' intelligence unit warned Iranians Sunday against any pro-Israel social media posts after some people in Iran have voiced support for Israel after Iran's attack.\n\nIran defends attack on Israel\n\nIran's U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said Sunday that the country's action was necessary and proportionate. He added that while Tehran does not seek an escalation or war in the region, it reaffirms its right to defend itself.\n\n\"If the U.S. initiates military operations against Iran, its citizens, or its security and interests, Iran will use its inherent right to respond proportionately,\" he said.\n\nUN chief urges restraint after attack\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint Sunday after Iran’s attack on Israel and reminded members of the U.N. Security Council that acts of reprisal involving the use of force are barred under international law. He also condemned the attack and warned against further escalation.\n\nGuterres told member states during a Security Council meeting that the U.N. charter prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\n\n\"The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,\" Guterres said.\n\nUS-Israel alliance 'ironclad'\n\nIn the wake of Saturday's attack by Iran, Schumer called the United States' commitment to Israel's security \"ironclad.\"\n\nHundreds of drones and missiles from Iran had been fired in Israel's direction, but Schumer, speaking during a Sunday news conference following a call with Biden and congressional leaders, noted Israel and a U.S.-led coalition were able to take down about 99% of the munitions.\n\nDaniel Hagari, a spokesman for Israel's Defense Forces, said in a Sunday briefing that out of more than 120 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, a small number penetrated Israel's border. The rest were shot down. He said an Israeli air force base in southern Israel sustained some \"minor damage to infrastructure.\"\n\nUS-led coalition played key role in stopping attack\n\nIsrael's response to the historic Iran strike was boosted by a U.S.-led coalition of warplanes and naval assets that helped intercept 300 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles, according to a U.S. official.\n\nU.S. fighter aircraft and guided-missile destroyers knocked down some of the incoming missiles and drones, according to the official who was briefed on the operation but not authorized to speak publicly. Israel’s Arrow, David’s Sling and Iron Dome also took down most of the attack.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nG7 nations vow to 'avoid further escalation'\n\nA group of nations that includes some of the world's top economies said Sunday that they are fully committed to Israel's security.\n\nGroup of Seven nations said in a unanimous statement that Iran's attack on Israel risked \"provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation.\"\n\nBiden met Sunday with the group, the White House said.\n\n\"This must be avoided,\" G7 leaders said. \"We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.\"\n\nThe group also said it planned to work closely together \"to end the crisis in Gaza,\" and recommitted to working toward a permanent cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas, release of all militant-held hostages and the delivery of more humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.\n\nWill Israel retaliate against Iran?\n\nIran's armed forces chief, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, told Iran's state TV on Sunday that if Israel retaliates, Iran's response would be \"much larger\" than the overnight drone and missile assault.\n\nBagheri also warned that if the U.S. backs an Israeli retaliation it would lead to the targeting of U.S. military bases.\n\nIn a separate statement, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said \"any new Israeli adventure will be met with a heavier and regretful response.\"\n\nWill US go to war with Iran?\n\nKirby said Sunday that the U.S. is not interested in a battle with Iran.\n\n\"The president's been very clear: We don't seek a war with Iran, we're not looking for escalation here, we will continue to help Israel defend itself,\" Kirby said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential threats to U.S. troops in the region, Kirby said the Pentagon is staying vigilant. “We have not seen any attacks on U.S. troops or personnel in the region or our facilities and nothing to report to this morning. But we’re obviously going to watch that very, very closely.\"\n\n− Elizabeth Beyer\n\nBritish leader says British jets shot down drones\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Sunday that British military jets also helped thwart Iran's attack. “I can confirm that our planes did shoot down a number of Iranian attack drones,” Sunak said.\n\nHe appealed for calm in the region to avoid an escalation of the conflict. “If this attack had been successful, the fallout for regional stability would be hard to overstate,\" Sunak said. \"We stand by the security of Israel and the wider region, which is of course important for our security here at home, too. What we now need is for calm heads to prevail.”\n\nPalestinians in Gaza see Iran attack as payback\n\nMany Palestinians in Gaza, which has been under constant bombardment from Israel for months, applauded the Iranian attack.\n\n“Whoever decides to attack Israel, dares to attack Israel at a time when the whole world acts in its service is a hero in the eyes of Palestinians regardless of whether we share their (Iran’s) ideology or not,” said Majed Abu Hamza, 52, a father of seven, in Gaza City. “We have been slaughtered for over six months and no one dared to do anything.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said Sunday that it will soon call up two reserve divisions for operations in Gaza.\n\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have died amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas after the Oct. 7 border attacks by militants, who killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostage.\n\nLives lost in Gaza: Visualizing the death and destruction of Israel's war in Gaza\n\nCongress could quickly agree on Israel aid, Rubio says\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., seemed to suggest Congress could quickly send aid to Israel, without sending anything to Ukraine.\n\n“We could go on Monday to Washington, D.C., and we could pass aid to Israel, right away,” said Rubio, vice chair of the Senate select committee on intelligence.\n\nAid to both countries has stalled, as several House Republicans have opposed sending additional funding to Ukraine. A $95 billion aid package to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan sits currently stuck in the House after passing the Senate in February.\n\nRubio said he is confident, though, that if the Senate were to send the House an Israel-only aid bill, that the lower chamber would support it.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nIran's attack on Israel: How did we get here?\n\nIsrael never confirmed it was behind an April 1 attack on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria, that killed seven of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps officers, including two senior military commanders: Brig-Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig-Gen. Mohammad Hadi Haji-Rahimi.\n\nHowever, Israel has carried out dozens if not hundreds of strikes on Iran-aligned groups in Syria and elsewhere in recent years. Since the start of Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, cross-border assaults on northern Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria have intensified.\n\nIran severed all diplomatic and commercial ties with Israel after its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIsrael's airspace reopens after attack\n\nIsrael reopened its airspace Sunday after Iran's attack led to its closure and caused flight cancellations. Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan also said their respective airspaces had reopened to commercial traffic.\n\nEL AL, Israel's flag carrier airline, said its operations had resumed, but many flights were delayed or canceled.\n\nMajor Iranian airports have cancelled all flights until Monday, the country's state media reported.\n\nNo anesthesia after 6 months of war: Pregnant women in Gaza Strip face starvation\n\nHamas says Iran had 'natural right' to attack Israel\n\nIran's ally Hamas, which has been fighting Israel in Gaza for more than six months, defended the drone and missile attack on Israel.\n\n\"We in Hamas regard the military operation conducted by the Islamic Republic of Iran a natural right and a deserved response on the crime of targeting the Iranian consulate in Damascus and the assassination of several leaders of the Revolutionary Guards,\" said Hamas in a statement seen by the Reuters news agency.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas rejected a new cease-fire proposal from Israel, which is trying to secure the return of hostages seized by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack.\n\nU.S. Embassy lifts 'shelter in place' order\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem lifted its \"shelter in place\" order for U.S. workers. In a statement, the diplomatic mission said that the \"threat of drone and/or missile barrages has diminished.\"\n\nThe embassy did not lift more general travel restrictions in Israel for its employees and their families, reiterating that their personal travel is limited to within and between Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Be’er Sheva.\n\nIran attacked Israel. What happens now?\n\nWorld leaders and officials from China to the U.K. expressed alarm in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel and called for both Israel and Iran to exercise restraint and to avoid further escalation.\n\n\"The EU strongly condemns the unacceptable Iranian attack against Israel,\" Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, said in a post on social platform X. “This is an unprecedented escalation and a grave threat to regional security.\"\n\nJordan's Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh said that any escalation would lead to \"dangerous paths.\"\n\nJonathan Panikoff, director of the Atlantic Council think tank's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, wrote in a blog commentary that \"Iran’s launch of ballistic missiles, in conjunction with over 100 drones, puts the region on the precipice of a broader war that almost no one seems to actually want; one that most actors − the United States, Arab states, even Hezbollah − have sought to avoid over the last six months.\"\n\nPanikoff added that, \"At best, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is almost certain to respond and take steps to attack Iranian targets, probably in Iran, in a manner that will be specific and contained and won’t lead to another significant Iranian response. At worst, the Israeli response will be intense and include the bombardment of important Iranian sites.\"\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/09/turkeys-syria-offensive-imminent-after-trump-pulls-u-s-troops-back/3916434002/", "title": "Turkey launches military offensive in Syria after Trump pulls back US ...", "text": "Turkish forces launched a military offensive into Kurdish-controlled parts of Syria Wednesday, just days after President Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing U.S. troops in the region -- a move that left the Kurds, longtime U.S. allies, vulnerable to the Turkish operation.\n\n\"The Turkish Armed Forces, together with the Syrian National Army, just launched #OperationPeaceSpring\" against Kurdish fighters in Syria, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president announced on Twitter.\n\n\"Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\" he said of Turkey's long-planned assault on the Kurds, who have been America's chief ally in Syria fighting the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS.\n\nThe move comes in defiance of international criticism and just days after President Donald Trump announced U.S. troops supporting Kurdish forces in the area would be pulled back from the border zone.\n\nAmerican lawmakers vowed to retaliate against Turkey and begged Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.\n\n\"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\" Sen.

Trump administration officials have defended the decision to remove American troops from that region, saying the president did not want U.S. forces to be in the line of fire.

Katie Hobbs to call for an investigation into the National Park Service's handling of the fire, which began July 4.\n\n“I am incredibly saddened by the destruction of the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, and my heart goes out to every person impacted by the Dragon Bravo Fire,\" Hobbs said. \"As someone who was born and raised in Arizona, I know what the Grand Canyon National Park means to so many people, not just in Arizona, but all over the world, and how devastating it is to see this damage done to one of Arizona’s most cherished landmarks.\"\n\nThe lodge, which opened in 1937, was the only hotel located inside the national park at the North Rim. There are few other lodging options near the main visitor hub of the North Rim, with the closest more than a dozen miles further north of the canyon's edge.\n\nThe fire had burned between 50 and 80 structures on the North Rim, according to park officials.\n\nHobbs thanked the firefighters and first responders tasked with combating the blaze and called for an independent investigation into the decision-making that resulted in the devastation.\n\n\"An incident of this magnitude demands intense oversight and scrutiny into the federal government’s emergency response,\" Hobbs said. \"They must first take aggressive action to end the wildfire and prevent further damage. But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park. While the flame was started with a lightning strike, the federal government chose to manage that fire as a controlled burn during the driest, hottest part of the Arizona summer.\"\n\nDo you have photos or video of the Grand Canyon Lodge to share on azcentral.com?

Send it to us atour video-photo upload site.\n\nThe lodge building was made of a limestone façade that was sourced nearby, and massive ponderosa pine trees were turned into support beams to hold up a sloped roof capable of supporting heavy loads of snow, according to the National Park Service. The property consisted of a main lodge building with 23 deluxe cabins and over 90 regular cabins.\n\nThe original lodge that opened in the late 1920s burned down in a fire in September 1932. That fire destroyed the lodge within minutes, sending the lodge's staff fleeing in the early morning hours, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe original North Rim lodge was built in part for the Union Pacific Railroad, which quickly reestablished a cafeteria and recreation hall after the 1932 fire, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe new lodge sat on the foundation of the former and used many of the original's materials, but was scaled back in its design, removing a second story and observation tower that were part of the original, according to the National Park Service.\n\nArchitect Gilbert Stanley Underwood followed National Park Service guidelines that required buildings to represent their surrounding environment. The lodge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.\n\nAmong the amenities typical of a hotel, the lodge complex included a saloon, a deli, a coffee shop, a post office, a gift shop, and a visitors center. They were all in operation before wildfire closed the North Rim to visitors, according to the National Park Service.\n\nAramark operated the Grand Canyon Lodge for the National Park Service.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of the Grand Canyon Lodge and numerous other historic buildings at the Grand Canyon’s North Rim,\" said Debbie Albert, an Aramark spokesperson. \"We are grateful that all of our employees and guests have been safely evacuated, and we join the National Park Service in mourning the loss of these iconic and beloved structures.\"\n\nThe inner canyon, including Phantom Ranch, was closed, as were trails to the inner canyon, because a water treatment facility on the North Rim was damaged by fire and was leaking chlorine gas, park officials said. Chlorine gas is toxic and is heavier than air, meaning it could settle into the lower part of the canyon.\n\nPark officials said the gas leak prevented fire retardant from being dropped and forced firefighting personnel to evacuate.\n\nCurt Stanley, an air traffic controller who has been working on the fire, said that crews were unable to use fire retardant on July 12, the day the lodge burned, due to orders from the National Park Service. Fire retardant leaves red stains, caused by a dye used to make it easier to identify areas where retardant was dropped. The use of retardant is often avoided near historic structures. \"That ground stays red until it rains,\" Stanley said.\n\nRetardant is typically used when firefighting efforts focus on suppression, rather than a contain-and-confine strategy, as officials employed at the start of the Dragon Bravo Fire.\n\nOnce the lodge and other structures burned, Stanley said crews were given the go-ahead to switch to full suppression efforts and use retardant.\n\nThe North and South Kaibab Trails, as well as the Bright Angel Trail below Havasupai Gardens, were closed to hikers.\n\nRep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., said on social media that the lodge's destruction was a reminder of the need for the federal government and states to invest in wildfire resilience.\n\n\"Heartbreaking news for Arizona & everyone who loves this special place,\" Stanton wrote.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said Arizona lost a piece of state history.\n\n\"As Governor Hobbs has rightly called for, there must be a comprehensive, independent investigation into the handling of fire and the rationale for treating it as a controlled burn — especially as Arizona experiences the driest, hardest part of summer,\" Gallego wrote on X. \"I will do my part on the federal level to get answers.\"\n\nThe office of Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., offered thanks to firefighters on the social media platform and said the Trump administration would do all it could \"to preserve our great national parks and end the failed Biden administration practices that have led to too many of these conflagrations.\"\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., whose 2nd Congressional district includes the Grand Canyon's North Rim, described the losses as devastating in a statement to The Arizona Republic.\n\n\"The Grand Canyon National Park is one of the greatest treasures in Arizona. The losses at the North Rim are devastating. We are in touch with park leadership, as well as the Department of Interior,\" wrote Crane.\n\nHe expressed gratitude for the continued firefighting efforts.\n\n\"We’re so grateful for all of the firefighters and first responders who continue to risk everything protecting rural Arizonans. There is a lot of work ahead,\" Crane said.\n\nWhite Sage and Dragon Bravo wildfires burn on the North Rim\n\nTwo wildfires burning around 30 miles apart to the north of the Grand Canyon had grown to over 45,000 acres by July 13, according to state and federal fire officials.\n\nA vast area, the Kaibab Plateau from the Utah-Arizona line down to the Grand Canyon, had been put under evacuation orders. Fire crews urged the public to avoid the area. Highway 89A was closed at Fredonia and Bitter Springs.\n\nThe northernmost of the two fires, the White Sage Fire, had burned 40,126 acres. Smoke was first reported on the evening of July 9, after a thunderstorm. The fire was sparked by lightning and intensified by strong winds and low relative humidity, according to InciWeb, a federal government wildfire tracker. It burned through grass, shrubs, and native pinyon-juniper trees, the Bureau of Land Management reported.\n\nThe Dragon Bravo Fire, burning to the south within Grand Canyon National Park, has reached 5,000 acres according to InciWeb.\n\nThe Dragon Bravo Fire was responsible for burning the North Rim structures, including the historic lodge. Hot, dry, and windy conditions fueled its growth, with flames spreading through mixed conifer, aspen, and ponderosa pine forests, according to InciWeb.\n\nOver 500 fire personnel were assigned to the White Sage fire, while 70 were assigned to the Dragon Bravo Fire. Both fires remained at 0% containment on July 13.\n\nThe National Park Service initially opted to monitor the Dragon Bravo Fire as a controlled burn when it first ignited on July 4, but switched gears after uncommonly strong winds on July 11 and 12 allowed it to jump multiple \"containment features\" and subsequently destroy numerous structures.\n\nA \"complex incident management team\" will assume command of the Dragon Bravo Fire beginning on July 14, according to InciWeb.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/14/grand-canyon-wildfire-north-rim/85189413007/", "title": "Grand Canyon wildfire: Historic lodge, cabins destroyed; evacuations", "text": "Editor's note: This page summarizes news of the Grand Canyon North Rim fire for Monday, July 14. For the lastest news on the Grand Canyon fire, visit USA TODAY's story for Tuesday, July 15.\n\nFirefighters in Arizona were trying to contain a pair of fast-moving wildfires that destroyed a historic lodge in Grand Canyon National Park, closed a section of the park for the rest of the season and prompted calls for an investigation into federal authorities' wildfire response.\n\nThe two wildfires burning at or near the park's North Rim include the White Sage Fire and the Dragon Bravo Fire. The blazes have consumed about 45,000 acres of land as of July 14, an area about the size of Washington, D.C.\n\nPark officials said the Dragon Bravo Fire, which has burned 5,000 acres within the park, destroyed dozens of structures, including the Grand Canyon Lodge, the only hotel inside the national park at the North Rim.\n\nAbout 35 miles north, the White Sage Fire has torched about 62 square miles of land and triggered evacuations across communities near the Utah border and the Grand Canyon's North Rim. Lightning strikes ignited both fires, and a combination of strong winds, low humidity and high daily temperatures fueled their rapid expansion, officials said.\n\nHere's what we know about the wildfires.\n\nGrand Canyon North Rim under 'extreme heat warning'\n\nThe National Weather Service issued an \"extreme heat warning\" for the Grand Canyon Village and the park's North Rim on July 14.\n\nSuch warnings are reserved for the hottest days of the year and are issued only when \"extremely dangerous heat conditions are expected or ongoing,\" according to the weather service. Daytime temperatures in the area could reach 106 to 115 degrees.\n\nThe scorching heat has hampered firefighters' ability to battle the blaze on the ground in the daytime, officials said.\n\nWhite Sage Fire triggers evacuations, closures near Arizona\n\nNorth of the Grand Canyon, the White Sage Fire was first reported July 9 and has grown steadily, leading to evacuation orders over a vast area, from the Kaibab Plateau to the Utah-Arizona line and the North Rim.\n\nAs of July 14, the wildfire had destroyed 40,186 acres of land and remains 0% contained, according to InciWeb, a federal government wildfire tracker. No injuries or damaged structures have been reported.\n\nFire officials said they made progress over the weekend. Containment lines near the White Sage community held as firefighters suppressed growth on the fire's southern edge, according to InciWeb.\n\nTo the north, however, \"the fire is experiencing rapid growth,\" particularly in the footprint of a 2020 wildfire that temporarily closed the North Rim, officials said.\n\n\"Hot, dry, and windy conditions continue to challenge firefighting efforts,\" InciWeb said.\n\nDragon Bravo Fire: How it started and ravaged North Rim\n\nThe Dragon Bravo Fire was ignited by a lightning strike July 4. Initially, fire officials sought to manage the blaze by setting up containment lines and halting its growth.\n\nBut over the weekend, powerful wind gusts up to 40 mph led the fire to expand 500 acres overnight, swallowing dozens of structures, including historic cabins. It also threatened a water treatment facility, leading officials to evacuate some firefighting personnel and halt aerial operations because of a possible chlorine leak.\n\nNo injuries or deaths were reported as staff and hikers were evacuated from the North Rim area before the blaze exploded in size.\n\nPark officials said the North Rim will remain closed for the rest of the season, which runs from May 15 to Oct. 15. Visitors to the more popular South Rim, which is open all year, were advised to stay updated on possible air quality alerts.\n\n\"The fire is being managed with an aggressive full suppression strategy,\" the National Park Service said. \"Fire behavior is still very active.\"\n\nGrand Canyon Lodge destroyed in wildfire\n\nThe Grand Canyon Lodge sat perched on the canyon's edge and offered guests panoramic views of the natural wonder.\n\nThe lodge opened in 1937 after the original building burned to the ground in a wildfire in September 1932. The new property was made up of the main lodge building, 23 deluxe cabins and more than 90 regular cabins, the park service said.\n\nThe lodge building was made of a limestone facade that was sourced nearby, and massive ponderosa pine trees were turned into support beams for a sloped roof capable of withstanding heavy loads of snow.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of Grand Canyon Lodge and historic buildings on the North Rim,\" read a statement from the National Park Service.\n\nRep.

He had since retired, but he came back into service as a \"casual hire\" under the U.S. National Forest Service, Stanley said.\n\nStanley was no stranger to Arizona. He visited the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in the mid-1990s, when the Lodge was still standing, he said.\n\nIn 2004, he returned to Arizona to help fight the Willow Fire, which burned nearly 120,000 acres southwest of Payson. While battling the fire, Curt met his wife, Christina, who lived in Arizona at the time. \"Fire has been part of our life ever since,\" Christina said.\n\nCommunity rallies to support employees and residents of Grand Canyon Lodge\n\nNate Loper, a Grand Canyon tour guide, organized a fundraiser to help support victims of the Dragon Bravo Fire, many of whom were employees, guides and seasonal staff of the national park who were impacted directly by the wildfire.\n\nThe North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park was closed for the duration of the 2025 season, according to park officials.\n\n\"These are the men and women who pour their hearts into maintaining trails, guiding guests, and creating unforgettable experiences for millions of visitors,\" Loper said in a statement.\n\nDonations were sought on GoFundMe, and Loper shared the message on a custom website just for the fundraiser.\n\n\"If the North Rim has ever inspired you, welcomed you, or left you in awe, now’s the time to give back,\" Loper said.\n\nLoper has years of experience exploring the rim and rafting through the Colorado River.\n\nHe said he took his family and children to stay at the Lodge in the past, describing it as a quiet and scenic retreat.\n\nHistory repeated. Grand Canyon Lodge was destroyed by fire in the past\n\nThe original North Rim lodge was built in part for the Union Pacific Railroad and opened in 1928, according to the National Park Service.\n\nIn September 1932, a fire destroyed the lodge quickly, sending the lodge's staff fleeing during the early morning hours, according to the National Park Service.

But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park.\"\n\nHobbs called for an independent investigation into the fire's management and a report on the decisions that were made that led to the Grand Canyon Lodge and other structures burning.\n\nGallego said Hobbs was right to call for an investigation. \"I will do my part on the federal level to get answers,\" he said.\n\nWhat's been lost to the Dragon Bravo Fire?\n\nAs of July 14, the Dragon Bravo Fire destroyed an estimated 70 structures, including the Grand Canyon Lodge, along with National Park Service administrative buildings, visitor facilities and historic cabins, according to Stefan La-Sky, public information officer for Southwest Area Complex Incident Management Team.\n\nLa-Sky said the Grand Canyon Lodge burned overnight on July 12.\n\nAramark operated the Grand Canyon Lodge for the National Park Service.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of the Grand Canyon Lodge and numerous other historic buildings at the Grand Canyon’s North Rim,\" said Debbie Albert, an Aramark spokesperson. \"We are grateful that all of our employees and guests have been safely evacuated, and we join the National Park Service in mourning the loss of these iconic and beloved structures.\"\n\nNo human deaths or injuries were reported, and all staff and North Rim residents were evacuated before the wildfire’s rapid escalation, according to the park officials.\n\nWhat parts of the Grand Canyon are closed?\n\nThe entire North Rim of the Grand Canyon remained closed as of July 13, along with all inner Canyon corridor trails, campgrounds and associated areas until further notice. Closed trails include North Kaibab Trail, South Kaibab Trail, Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Trail below Havasupai Gardens.\n\nPark officials recommended that people planning to visit the South Rim check the air quality by visiting fire.airnow.gov.\n\nWhat other wildfires are burning in the area?\n\nThe White Sage Fire, roughly 30 miles north of the Dragon Bravo Fire, has burned 49,286 acres after it was ignited due to a lightning strike, according to InciWeb, a federal government wildfire tracker.\n\nSmoke was first reported on the evening of July 9, after a thunderstorm. It burned through grass, shrubs, and native pinyon-juniper trees, according to the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nA vast area, the Kaibab Plateau from the Utah-Arizona line down to the Grand Canyon, had been put under evacuation orders. Fire crews urged the public to avoid the area. Highway 89A was closed at Fredonia and Bitter Springs.\n\nOn the evening of July 13, the fire crossed over Highway 89A and headed southeast.\n\n\"Extreme fire behavior\" was seen on July 13, according to an official on InciWeb. Air tankers dropped nearly 180,000 gallons of fire retardant on July 13 alone.\n\nStrong northerly winds pushed the fire further south, with fire embers spreading through the wilderness, aggravated by dry, hot weather with low humidity. There was a slight chance of storms, according to InciWeb.\n\nCrews worked overnight to try to establish a containment line, according to InciWeb.\n\n'Just short on resources': Air traffic controller details North Rim fire fight\n\nCurt Stanley fought the Dragon Bravo Fire as an air traffic controller called in to be part of an aircraft crew for a plane through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A resident of Weiser, Idaho, Stanley was in Show Low along with his plane, which was being swapped out for another in Mesa, he said in a phone interview July 13.\n\n\"The lodge and all the historic cabins, and employee housing, all that was our number one area for protection,\" Stanley said.\n\nBattling the fire overnight before it burned the Lodge in the early morning hours of July 13, Stanley said there were not enough crews or resources to fight the fire effectively.\n\nHe described an image of the destroyed Grand Canyon Lodge that was seen by infrared cameras mapping the fire overnight.\n\n\"I can't see it with the naked eye from the air, so I have a screen up in front of me that I can see what my camera operator is looking at,\" Stanley said. \"There were multiple buildings destroyed,\" he added.\n\nStanley said he would continue suppression efforts on the fire on July 14, working as part of a three-man aerial attack crew, flying other federally managed aircraft.\n\nReach the reporter Perry Vandell at perry.vandell@gannett.com or 602-444-2474.

{"question_id": "20250718_2", "search_time": "2025/07/19/05:14", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/01/biden-state-union-transcript/6979398001/", "title": "State of the Union 2022 transcript", "text": "President Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. The roughly hour-long speech started a little after 9 p.m.\n\nBiden spoke about several of his administration's domestic priorities such as voting rights, combatting rising inflation, the electrification of the transportation system to fight climate change and other challenges facing the nation.\n\nHe also addressed Russia's ongoing invasion into Ukraine.\n\nHere's a transcript of Biden's speech:\n\nState of the Union: Biden faces a nation rattled by inflation, uncertain of his leadership\n\nFrom Ukraine to inflation: 5 things to watch for in Biden's State of the Union address\n\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we're finally together again.\n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats, Republicans, Independents. But most importantly as Americans. With a duty to one another, to America, to the American people to the Constitution and with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.\n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined.\n\nHe met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world.\n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nAnd in this struggle, President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States (Oksana Markarova) is here tonight sitting with the first lady.\n\nLet each of us, if you’re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world. To Ukraine.\n\nWe, the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving.\n\nAnd the cost, the threats to the America, and America, to the world keeps rising.\n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created, to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.\n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated – repeated – efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united, and that’s what we did. We stayed united.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\n\nWe spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas, from the Americas to Asia and African continents to confront Putin.\n\nLike many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsify and justify his aggression.\n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with the truth, and now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and many others – even Switzerland –are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.\n\nTogether, along with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We’re cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\n\nWe’re choking Russia’s access, we’re choking Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. I mean it.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd tonight I’m announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.\n\nThe Ruble has already lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.\n\nTogether with our allies, we’re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We’re giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and we’ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.\n\nBut let me be clear. Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in a conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose, we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nAnd as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power, every single inch.\n\nAnd we’re clear-eyed. Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a pound of Ukrainian people, a proud, proud people, pound for pound ready to fight with every inch of energy they have. They’ve known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russian economy. And that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home, but I know news about what’s happening can seem alarming to all Americans.\n\nBut I want you to know we’re going to be okay. We’re going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West. We see unity among the people who are gathering in cities, in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is the real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you. We stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he’ll never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHe’ll never extinguish their love of freedom, and he will never – never – weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing and so much more.\n\nI understand. Like many of you did, my Dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when, if the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family. It had an impact.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as president was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nBecause people were hurting, we needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk.\n\nIt cut the cost of health care insurance and, as my Dad used to say, it gave people just a little bit of breathing room.\n\nUnlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people — and left no one behind.\n\nAnd it worked. It worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America.\n\nThe economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth rate in 40 years, and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn’t worked for working people in this nation for too long.\n\nFor the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would benefit. But that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nLook, Vice President Harris and I ran for office, and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this, but ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows, when the middle class grows, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges and airports on Earth, and now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix it.\n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I thank my Republican friends, who joined to invest and rebuild America. The single biggest investment in history.\n\nIt was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re now talking about an infrastructure decade.\n\nLook, it’s going to transform America, to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world – particularly China.\n\nI’ve told (China President) Xi Jinping, it’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways all across America.\n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of climate change and promote environmental justice. We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes so every child, every American, has clean water to drink at home and at school. We’re going to provide affordable high-speed internet for every American, rural, suburban, urban and tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nWhen we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America – we’re going to do it by buying American: buy American products, support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration, Democrat or Republican, says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it.\n\nWe’ll buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.\n\nBut folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need a level playing field with China and other competitors.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nWe used to invest almost 2% of our GDP in research and development. We don’t now. China is.\n\nLet me give you one example why it’s so important to pass.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of Dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\n\nThat’s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor “mega site.”\n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten-thousand new jobs. In those factories, the average job about $135,000 a year.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology, the internet, technology that has yet to be invented.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight... Pat came to see me, and he told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion. That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history.\n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. So let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it, and we’ll really take off in a big way. And folks, Intel is not alone. There’s something happening in America. Just look around and you’ll see an amazing story. The rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.\" The revitalization of American manufacturing. Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas.\n\nThat’s what’s happening. Ford is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone. Powered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, 'It’s time to bury the label ‘Rust Belt.’ It’s time to see what used to be called the Rust Belt become the home of significant resurgence of manufacturing.\n\nAnd with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth, higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. Look, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. You didn’t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out. The factory was closed.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars last year. One-third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. And guess what, prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well. And so we have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI think I have a better idea to fight inflation: lower your costs, not your wages. That means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nLook, economists call this “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\nSeventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and I believe most Americans support the plan.\n\nAnd here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy, the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That’s what it costs the pharmaceutical company.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times that amount. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God’s name you’re going to be able to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your family, what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it, think about that. That’s what I think about.\n\nJoshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\n\nFor Joshua, and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nAnd drug companies will do very, very well, their profit margin. And while we’re at it, I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this, let’s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families with Affordable Care Act plans to save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make these savings permanent.\n\nSecond, let’s cut energy costs for families – an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments, tax credits to weatherize your home and your businesses to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you’re not going to have to pay at the pump.\n\nThe third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of child care, cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major city in America you pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single dad for five years raising two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother and a sister that really helped.\n\nBut middle-class and working folks shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income to care for their young children.\n\nMy plan will cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work generating economic growth.\n\nBut my plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. All these will lower costs for families.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody, let me say this again, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.\n\nI may be wrong, but my guess is if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we’d all agree that the present tax system ain’t fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share. Look, last year, last year, like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman, we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in (Delaware) than every other state in America combined, and I still won 36 years in a row.\n\nThe point is, even they understand you should pay just a fair share. Last year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes. Now look, it’s not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nAnd that’s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we’re able to put together, I was able to be somewhat helpful, 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\n\nIt’ll raise billions of dollars. That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.\n\nSo that’s my plan, but we’ll go in more detail later. We will grow the economy and lower costs for families. So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. We all know we’ve got to make changes.\n\nAnd while you’re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs, the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see every day how much money was being spent or was going to the right place.\n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs are back.\n\nWe’re going to go after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans. And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half of what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up profits.\n\nWhen corporations have to compete, their profits go up, but your prices go up when they don’t have to compete. Small businesses and family farmers and ranchers, I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states. Guess what? You’ve got four basic meat packing facilities. That’s it. You play with them or you don’t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more because there’s only four.\n\nSee what’s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less of foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will looked at closely\n\nWe’re also going cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on skills not just their degrees.\n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nLook, let’s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union — they shouldn’t be able to be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated and exhausted. That doesn’t even count close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.\n\nBut I also know this, because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guideline.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free. And based on projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives.\n\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19.” But tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard.\n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely in my view\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children.\n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.\n\nWe are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\n\nI’ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd now we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. On testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\n\nIf you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order another group of tests. Go to covidtests.gov starting next week, and you can get more tests.\n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years.\n\nAnd if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed. I can’t promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt’s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.\n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. With 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks.\n\nOf course, continuing this costs money. So it will not surprise you, I’ll be back to see y’all.\n\nI’m going to soon send a request to Congress. The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again. We may need them again, so I expect Congress, and I hope you’ll pass that quickly.\n\nFourth, we’ll continue vaccinating the world. We’ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any nation on Earth.\n\nWe won’t stop. You can’t build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine. The vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.\n\nWe’ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, much loss of life.\n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. So stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we really are: fellow Americans.\n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. It’s a long time coming, but we can change how to move forward — on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices, and we’ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nLike some of you that have been around for a while, I’ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investigating crime prevention and community policing, cops who’ll walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Let’s come together and protect our communities, restore trust and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in more proven strategies. Proven strategies like community violence interruption — trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.\n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd we’ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home,. No serial numbers. Can’t be traced.\n\nI ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Why? Why?\n\nFolks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\n\nLook, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. The only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufacturers.\n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And, look, it’s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote – we’ve been there before - but to subvert the entire election.\n\nWe can’t let this happen.\n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans know who’s funding our elections.\n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer: an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd we all know, no matter what your ideology, one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a president has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAs I did four days ago, I’ve nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation’s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. From a family of public school educators and police officers. She’s a consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support including the the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice and former judges supported by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.\n\nAnd as you might gas, I think we can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster and those who aren’t legitimately here can be sent back.”\n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do, it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nFolks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade — standing precedent for half a century —is under attack as never before.\n\nIf you want to go forward, not backwards, we must protect access to health care., preserve a woman’s right to choose, and continue to advance maternal health care for all Americans.\n\nAnd folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families, it’s simply wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have your back as your president, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nFolks, as I’ve just demonstrated, while it often appears that we do not agree, we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd we’ll be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the nation. Four big things we can do together in my view.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. Stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nAnd if you’re suffering from addiction, you should know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health, especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. They have the money. We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nFolks, it’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care if we treat it that way in our insurance.\n\nThe third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They’re the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for those and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration provided assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne being stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits,” Many of you have been there. I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste – the waste of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and so much more.\n\nAnd they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors. Never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nI don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near, that his hooch was near in Iraq and earlier than that in Kosovo was the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I am committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sgt. First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nDanielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter.\n\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting. And neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle — we are going to do better.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we're expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI’m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth and last, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal. This is personal to me and Jill, and to Kamala, and so many of you who have lost someone you love: husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.\n\nCancer is the number two cause of death in America – second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years and I think we can do better than that. Turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\n\nMore support for patients and their families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund what I call ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department. Projects that led in DARPA to the Internet, GPS, and so much more to make our forces more safer and be able to wage war with more clarity.\n\nARPA will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, and more.\n\nA unity agenda for the nation.\n\nWe can do these things. It’s within our power. And I don’t see a partisan edge in any of those things.\n\nMy fellow Americans, tonight we have gathered in a sacred space: the citadel of democracy.\n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation of Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, debated totalitarianism and terror.\n\nWe built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\n\nNow is the hour.\n\nOur moment of responsibility.\n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\n\nIt is in this moment that our character of this generation is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\n\nWell, I know this nation.\n\nWe’ll meet the test.\n\nProtect freedom and liberty. Expand fairness and opportunity.\n\nAnd we will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I’ve been my whole life.\n\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp.\n\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.\n\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we’ve faced into an opportunity.\n\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\n\nSo, on this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the state of the nation, the State of the Union.\n\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong because you, the American people, are strong.\n\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago.\n\nAnd we’ll be stronger a year from now than we are today.\n\nThis is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\n\nAnd we will, as one people.\n\nOne America.\n\nThe United States of America.\n\nGod bless you all and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you.

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/12/26/dave-barry-year-review/20928427/", "title": "Dave Barry 2014 year in review", "text": "Dave Barry\n\nTNS News Service\n\nIt was a year of mysteries. To list some of the more baffling ones:\n\n• A huge airliner simply vanished, and to this day nobody has any idea what happened to it, despite literally thousands of hours of intensive speculation on CNN.\n\n• Millions of Americans suddenly decided to make videos of themselves having ice water poured on their heads. Remember? There were rumors that this had something to do with charity, but for most of us, the connection was never clear. All we knew was that, for a while there, every time we turned on the TV, there was a local newscaster or Gwyneth Paltrow or Kermit the Frog or some random individual soaking wet and shivering. This mysterious phenomenon ended as suddenly as it started, but not before uncounted trillions of American brain cells died of frostbite.\n\n• An intruder jumped the White House fence and, inexplicably, managed to run into the White House through the unlocked front door. Most of us had assumed that anybody attempting this would instantly be converted to a bullet-ridden pile of smoking carbon by snipers, lasers, drones, ninjas, etc., but it turned out that, for some mysterious reason, the White House had effectively the same level of anti-penetration security as a Dunkin' Donuts.\n\n• LeBron James deliberately moved to Cleveland.\n\nOf course not everything that happened in 2014 was mysterious. Some developments _ ISIS, Ebola, the song \"Happy\"_ were simply bad.\n\nThere was even some good news in 2014, mostly in the form of things that did not happen. A number of GM cars _ the final total could be as high as four _ were not recalled. There were several whole days during which no statements had to be issued by the U.S. Department of Explaining What The Vice President Meant To Say. And for the fifth consecutive year, the Yankees failed to even play in the World Series.\n\nBut other than that, it was a miserable 12 months. In case you have forgotten why, let's take one last look back, starting with...\n\nJANUARY\n\n...when the nation is invaded by the Polar Vortex, which blasts in from Canada, bringing with it heavy snows, record low temperatures and Justin Bieber, who penetrates as far south as Miami before being arrested for driving a Lamborghini drunk. Weather is also the big story in drought-stricken California, where the state legislature passes a tough new water-conservation law requiring all non-celebrity residents to go to the bathroom in Oregon.\n\nIn Colorado, the new year begins on a \"high\" note as the sale of recreational marijuana becomes legal. Despite dire predictions from critics that this will lead to increases in crime and addiction, state law-enforcement officials report that if you stare for a while at the flashing lights on top of their cars, you can see some amazing colors.\n\nIn a major speech, President Barack Obama, responding to allegations that the National Security Agency has been electronically snooping on foreign leaders, announces that all federal agencies will henceforth follow strict new guidelines on the sale and distribution of photos of Angela Merkel naked.

As tension mounts in the region, the United States and the European Union issue Stern Warnings to Russia, such as \"You better not annex the Crimea!\" And: \"Don't make us turn this car around!\" Nevertheless Russia goes ahead and annexes it, forcing the U.S. and Europe to escalate from Stern Warnings to Harsh Sanctions, including the suspension of Vladimir Putin's Netflix account.\n\nIn other international developments, Bill Clinton discreetly inquires about the legal requirements involved in running for president of France.\n\nHopes for an end to the brutal winter weather are dashed when the Polar Vortex, having disguised itself as a warm front, manages to slip past surrounding Massachusetts National Guard troops and escape moments before the Costco is leveled by artillery fire, destroying two-thirds of the state's supply of jerky.\n\nOn a happier note, Colorado announces that it has already collected marijuana sales taxes totaling $2 million, which the state plans to spend on \"a subwoofer the size of Delaware.\"\n\nGeneral Motors recalls 1.5 million more cars to correct a steering issue that causes certain models to deliberately aim for elderly pedestrians.\n\nIn a development that surprises film critics, Academy Awards voters, apparently hoping to woo a younger audience, award the Oscar for Best Picture to \"Sharknado.\"\n\nSpeaking of surprises, in...\n\nAPRIL\n\n...Russia, ignoring both the Stern Warnings and the Harsh Sanctions, continues its military intervention in Ukraine, leaving the United States with no choice but to deploy the ultimate weapon: Joe Biden, who is sent to Kiev to deliver a Strong Rebuke, followed by dinner.\n\nOn the domestic front, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who oversaw the rollout of Obamacare, resigns from the cabinet to take a position overseeing email storage for the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nIn an aviation miracle, a 15-year-old boy sneaks into the landing-gear compartment of a Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 and somehow survives a five-hour flight from San Jose to Maui.

General Motors, in what analysts view as a shrewd tactical move, announces that it is recalling 435,000 Fords. Tyson Foods recalls 75,000 pounds of frozen chicken nuggets following reports that some of them may contain chicken.\n\nOn a happier note, the Polar Vortex finally goes back to Canada after becoming involved in a street altercation with Alec Baldwin.\n\nIn sports, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, whose racist comments have sparked widespread outrage, is given the NBA's harshest possible punishment: Season tickets to the Knicks.\n\nSpeaking of harsh punishments, in...\n\nMAY\n\n...the United States and Europe, which are really starting to lose patience with Russia's actions in Ukraine, announce that they intend to \"seriously consider\" taking steps that could ultimately result in the cancellation of Vladimir Putin's American Express card.\n\nMeanwhile in Thailand, where people have the best names on Earth, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is found guilty of abuse of power by the Constitutional Court, whose members include Nurak Marpraneet, Taweekiat Meenakanit, Udomsak Nitimontree and, of course, Boonsong Kulbupar.

There will be a quiz on this.\n\nIn domestic news, the Department of Veterans Affairs is engulfed in scandal following revelations that some VA hospitals are just now getting around to treating veterans of the War of 1812. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki tells a Senate committee that he is \"mad as hell\" about this, but he ends up resigning after he is out-angered by President Obama, who according to a top aide is \"madder than hell.\" Numerous Republicans declare that they, too, are extremely mad. Basically, everybody in Washington is hopping mad about this scandal, leaving little doubt that it is only a matter of time before some strongly worded reports are generated.\n\nAlso resigning from the government is White House press spokesperson Jay Carney, who plans to pursue a career as a Magic 8-Ball specializing in \"Reply hazy try again.\"\n\nIn sports, the month's biggest event is the National Football League draft, which draws 32 million viewers, who tune in to witness the high-voltage excitement of Roger Goodell walking to a microphone every 10 minutes to read a name, kind of like a slower version of Bingo.

So from now on, if taxpayers tell us they lost something, or just plain forgot to make a tax payment, we'll be like, 'Hey, whatever! Stuff happens!'

Here are some of the highlights from the debate:\n\n• Former CEO Carly Fiorina claimed that 92% of the job losses in President Obama’s first term belonged to women, but women — and men — gained jobs by the end of Obama’s first term.\n\n• Businessman Donald Trump disputed the idea that he had criticized Sen. Marco Rubio and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for supporting H-1B visas. In fact, Trump’s immigration plan, posted on his website, is critical of both of them.\n\n• Trump also claimed his campaign was 100% self-funded, but more than half of the money his campaign has raised came from supporters’ contributions.\n\n• Fiorina blamed the Affordable Care Act for a large disparity in firm closings versus openings every year. But closings outnumbered firm births by the widest margin in 2009, a year before the law was enacted.\n\n• Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said it was “total propaganda” to say he was involved with a controversial nutritional supplement company, but he appeared in promotional videos for the company, touting its products.\n\n• New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that Social Security would be insolvent in seven to eight years. But even after the trust funds are exhausted — estimated to be in 14 to 19 years — the program can still pay out 73% of benefits for several decades.\n\n• Sen. Ted Cruz said women’s wages have declined under Obama, when in fact the latest figures show their wages have increased.\n\n• Rubio claimed CNBC’s John Harwood was wrong that a Tax Foundation analysis of his tax plan found those in the top 1% of earners would get nearly twice the gain as those in the middle. Harwood was right, and that’s on a percentage basis.\n\n• In the undercard debate, former New York governor George Pataki claimed the Iranians, Russians and Chinese “hacked” the private server Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state and obtained “state secrets.” There’s no evidence of that.\n\nTen candidates vied in the main event of the Oct. 28 economy-focused third Republican debate, hosted by CNBC at the University of Colorado Boulder: former Florida governor Jeb Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Marco Rubio and entrepreneur Donald Trump.\n\nFiorina On Job ‘Losses’ For Women Under Obama\n\nFiorina revived a dated, and now incorrect, talking point from Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012 when she claimed that “92% of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women.” It’s true that in the early years of Obama’s presidency, job losses from the recession continued to mount, and women lost a higher percentage of those jobs. But that ignores the massive job losses by men in the recession prior to Obama taking office. And by the end of Obama’s first term, both men and women had gained jobs.\n\nFiorina: It is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman president, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women. Ninety-two percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women.\n\nBack in April 2012, we wrote about Romney’s frequent campaign line that “over 92% of the jobs lost under this president were lost by women,” which Romney cited as evidence that Obama’s policies amounted to a “war on women.” Romney was referring to Bureau of Labor Statistics data between January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, the latest available at the time. We noted that statistic was accurate, but didn’t tell the whole story.\n\nLooking back at the whole recession, we wrote, men had lost many more jobs than women. But the biggest job losses for men came earlier in the recession, and recovery for men came faster than it did for women.\n\nFiorina, however, referred to “Obama’s first term,” and, of course, we now have access to data from the entirety of that first term. And looking at the full four years of Obama’s first term, both men and womengained jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women gained 416,000 jobs in Obama’s first term (about 32% of the overall job gains).\n\nAs for Obama’s second term, women have gained another roughly 3.5 million jobs between January 2013 and September 2015. That accounts for 49% of the overall job gains during Obama’s second term.\n\nTrump’s Forgotten Criticism\n\nTrump denied ever criticizing Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, as well as Marco Rubio, with regard to the H-1B visa program. But he actually did so — in his very own immigration plan on his own website.\n\nDuring a question about the visa program that allows companies to bring foreign workers to the United States for “specialty occupations” in technology and other fields, CNBC moderator Becky Quick said that Trump had criticized Zuckerberg for his position on H-1B visas. He responded:\n\nTrump: I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, he’s complaining about the fact that we’re losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country and they’re immediately sent out. I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley. … So I have nothing at all critical of him. Quick: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were … Trump: Probably, I don’t know — you people write the stuff.\n\nQuick also said that Trump has called Rubio Zuckerberg’s “own personal senator,” which Trump again denied, claiming “I never said that. … Somebody’s doing some really bad fact-checking. I never said that.” But Trump’s own immigration plan, posted on his website, appears to criticize both Zuckerberg and Rubio, and does contain the line Quick mentioned. His plan calls for raising wages paid to H-1B workers, which it says would convince companies to hire more Americans:\n\nTrump’s immigration plan: This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.\n\nAfter a commercial break, Quick pointed out that Trump had indeed criticized Rubio and Zuckerberg on his website. He did not address that point in his response, stressing the need for legal immigration and emphasizing his own job creation record.\n\nTrump Not Completely Self-Funded\n\nTrump claimed that his campaign is 100% self-funded. That’s false.\n\nTrump: I am the only person in either campaign that’s self-funding. I’m putting up 100% of my own money.\n\nTrump has spent about $1.9 million of his own money running for president, according to his October quarterly report to the Federal Election Commission. That includes a $1.8 million loan to his campaign, as well as in-kind contributions of nearly $104,000. But his campaign has spent more than $5.5 million to date, and the majority of that has come from campaign donors. In total, the Trump campaign has received more than $3.8 million from campaign supporters, which is more than half of the $5.8 million the campaign raised as of Sept. 30.\n\nAnd while Trump reportedly referred to the donations as “unsolicited,” his campaign website features a donate page telling supporters how to make contributions.\n\nFiorina on Business Deaths\n\nFiorina cited outdated figures on business openings and closings, saying that 400,000 small businesses form “every year” while 470,000 go out of business. “And why?” she asked. “They cite Obamacare.”\n\nThe most recent numbers, from 2012, show a disparity of about 15,000, and the gap between the creation of new firms and firm “deaths” has been narrowing. In 2009, a year before the Affordable Care Act was even signed into law, there were 409,133 firm births and 499,803 firm deaths.\n\nThat’s close to what Fiorina cited, and the figures come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s business dynamics statistics. The fact that those new firm births were outnumbered by deaths was highlighted in a Brookings Institution report from May 2014. That report said: “In fact, business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the thirty-plus-year history of our data.”\n\nThat report said nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but rather that it didn’t determine the causes and the trend could reverse in the future.\n\nBrookings Institution, “Declining Business Dynamism in the United States,” May 2014: Our findings stop short of demonstrating why these trends are occurring and perhaps more importantly, what can be done about it. Doing so requires a more complete knowledge about what drives dynamism, and especially entrepreneurship, than currently exists. But it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy—whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones. … To be sure, three years have passed since our latest data were collected in March 2011, so it’s entirely possible that some of these negative trends have reversed—or at least stabilized—since then.\n\nWe spoke with one of the authors of that report — Ian Hathaway — in May, and he sent us updated figures for 2012. Those showed new firm births were still outnumbered by deaths but the gap had continued to narrow since its peak in 2009. For 2012, deaths outnumbered births by nearly 15,000, not the 70,000 figure that Fiorina cited.\n\nCarson’s Involvement with Mannatech\n\nCarson claimed that he had no “involvement” with a controversial nutritional supplement company called Mannatech, and he called any claim to the contrary “propaganda.” But he actually has a long history with the company that goes beyond what he described, including giving paid speeches, participating in promotional videos and other activities.\n\nCNBC’s Carl Quintanilla: One more question. This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship. They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet your involvement continued. Why? Carson: Well, that’s easy to answer. I didn’t have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda. I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it’s a good product.\n\nThough one can debate the definition of “relationship” and “involvement,” there is ample evidence that Carson has at least some sort of history with Mannatech. He admits to giving paid speeches for the company, but reports by the The Wall Street Journal and the National Review have pointed out other connections as well going back at least a decade. For example, he participated in shooting several videos with or about the company; though TheWall Street Journal reported that Mannatech has removed those videos from its website, at least one video remains on YouTube as of this writing in which Carson touts the company’s work and products.\n\nThe National Review also reported that Carson was paid to appear on a PBS special and endorse Mannatech’s products, though the company said it was “a group of Mannatech independent distributors, not Mannatech Incorporated,” that actually paid for Carson’s appearance. Carson also once gave a speech in which he said the company helped fund an endowed post in Carson’s name at Johns Hopkins University, but his campaign has since said that Carson was mistaken, blaming “confusion” for the error.\n\nThough the extent of Carson’s involvement isn’t clear, it’s by no means “total propaganda” to say he had an involvement that went beyond “a couple of speeches.”\n\nSocial Security Spin\n\nChristie claimed that “Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.” That’s an exaggeration. The Social Security trust funds can continue to pay full benefits for another 14 to 19 years, according to government projections.\n\nChristie: All that’s in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago. And they’ve stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.\n\nSocial Security benefits are not in any imminent danger.\n\nIt is true that Social Security has been paying out more in benefits than it collects in revenues since 2010. But the Social Security trust funds hold Treasury bonds — or the “pile of IOUs,” as Christie calls them — for past years when Social Security collected more in revenues than it spent. The trust funds at the end of 2014 held nearly $2.8 trillion in Treasury bonds.\n\nThose trust funds have enough to keep paying full benefits until 2034, according to the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds’ most recent report.\n\n“Interest income and redemption of trust fund assets from the General Fund of the Treasury, will provide the resources needed to offset Social Security’s annual aggregate cash-flow deficits until 2034,” the trustees report says.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the trust funds would be depleted by 2029 — which is earlier than the trustees project, but still longer than Christie claimed.\n\nOnce the trust funds are exhausted, Social Security can still pay benefits with payroll tax income — but not the full scheduled amount. The trustees say tax income would be able to cover 73% of the benefits through 2089.\n\nCruz on Women’s Wages\n\nCruz claimed women’s wages have declined under Obama, when in fact the latest figures show their wages have increased.\n\nCruz: [U]nder Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.\n\nActually, the most recent breakdown from the Bureau of Labor Statistics of median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers shows that for women the figure was $728 in the three months ending Sept. 30, up from $647 in the last three months of 2008, just before Obama first took office. That’s an increase of $81 per week.\n\nEven adjusted for inflation, women workers’ median wages increased by more than 1% during the same period, in which inflation-adjusted wages for men remained flat.\n\nCruz meant to refer to total income, rather than just wages. It’s true that the latest Census Bureau figures show median annual income for women dropped by $705 (not $733) between 2008 and 2014 (expressed in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars). That reflects changes in many factors besides full-time wages, including changes in business income, capital gains income, and increasing numbers of retirees drawing pensions rather than working for wages or salaries.\n\nCruz got his $733 figure from an outdated GOP talking point that relied on figures for 2013. Newer figures were released last month. Figures covering 2015 won’t be available until late next year.\n\nRubio’s Tax Plan\n\nRubio said CNBC’s John Harwood was “wrong” that the Tax Foundation analysis of his tax plan found “you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1% as to people in the middle of the income scale.” But that is what the Tax Foundation found.\n\nRubio responded that the largest percentage gains would be for those with the lowest incomes, which is also true, according to the Tax Foundation’s analysis. But that doesn’t make Harwood’s statement wrong.\n\nThe Tax Foundation concluded that Rubio’s plan, when scored “dynamically” to account for expected economic growth, would result in an after-tax income increase of nearly 28% for those in the top 1%, while those in the middle income deciles — 40% to 50% and 50% to 60% — would see their after-tax income rise by 15.7% and 15.3%, respectively. People with incomes in the lowest 10% would see the greatest percentage gains, nearly 56%.\n\nIn other words, the greatest percentage income gains would be realized by those with low or high incomes, with smaller percentage gains for those in the middle.\n\nHere’s how the exchange unfolded:\n\nHarwood: The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1% as to people in the middle of the income scale. Since you’re the champion of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, don’t you have that backward? Rubio: No, that’s — you’re wrong. In fact, the largest after-tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And there’s a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them. Number one, you have people in this country that … Harwood: … Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1% under your plan would go up 27.9%. And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15%. Rubio: … Yeah, but that — because the math is, if you — 5% of a million is a lot more than 5% of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money, numerically, it’s gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here’s why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.\n\nRubio’s tax plan, which he coauthored with Sen. Mike Lee, includes a number of dramatic changes to the current tax code, including a reduction in the number of tax brackets to two (15% and 35%), the elimination of most itemized deductions (excluding charitable and mortgage interest deductions), and a new child tax credit of $2,500.\n\nThe Tax Foundation’s analysis of the plan, released in March, concluded it would increase incomes across all income levels. But some would do better than others.\n\nLooking at the plan on a “static basis,” which does not assume that tax cuts in the plan would spur economic growth, the Tax Foundation said the average gain in after-tax income would be 3.9%. But the biggest winners — on a percentage basis — would be those at the bottom and top of the income scale. For example, the analysis stated, the gain would be 11.4% for the 10% to 20% decile, 11.5% for the highest 1%, but only 1.7% for the 50-60% decile.\n\nThose disparities are not as dramatic when looking at the tax plan on a “dynamic” basis, which assumes the cuts would lead to significant economic growth. But the general pattern holds, with those at the upper and lower incomes faring the best, on a percentage basis.\n\nSo Harwood and Rubio were talking past each other a bit. Harwood was pointing out that those at the top income levels were seeing greater benefit — on a percentage basis — than those in the middle income levels. And that’s true. Rubio, meanwhile, insisted that those at the very lowest income levels would see the greatest percentage increase in income. That’s also true. Rubio further confused the issue with his explanation that “5% of a million is a lot more than 5% of a thousand.” As we noted earlier, it’s not just that those in the top 1% of tax filers would be seeing greater dollar savings in Rubio’s plan than those in the middle income brackets, it’s that those at the top would see a greater percentage gain as well.\n\nClinton’s Server\n\nFour more candidates — Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Sen. Rick Santorum – debated separately earlier in the evening.\n\nPataki claimed that the private server Hillary Clinton used as secretary of state was “hacked” and, as a result, the Iranians, Russians and Chinese obtained “state secrets.” While the FBI is conducting a security review of Clinton’s server, there is no evidence so far of a security breach.\n\nPataki: Hillary Clinton put a server, an unsecure server, in her home as secretary of state. We have no doubt that that was hacked, and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and others. That alone should disqualify her from being president of the United States.\n\nIt is true that Clinton, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential field, had an unusual email arrangement when she was secretary of state. She had a personal email account on a private server, rather than using the government email system.\n\nIt is also true that the inspector general of the intelligence community said emails maintained on her private server contained unmarked classified information, and he made a “security referral” to the Justice Department. Clinton turned over her computer server to the FBI, which is now investigating.\n\nBut was Clinton’s server “hacked”? And did the Iranians, Russians and Chinese obtain “state secrets”? That’s all speculation.\n\nPataki is referring to reports of hacking attempts that may or may not have been successful.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent an Oct. 5 letter to a firm that provided security on Clinton’s server. In his letter, Johnson wrote that the committee had evidence of hacking attempts that originated from China, South Korea and Germany, and that the security provided by the firm was not active for a three-month period.\n\nIt was also reported on Oct. 1 byThe New York Times that Clinton received spam emails that may have originated from Russia. As the Times wrote, Clinton’s server could have been compromised if she clicked on links in those emails, but there is no evidence that she did.\n\nPresident Obama said in an Oct. 11 60 Minutes interview that Clinton’s server did not compromise national security, but that has not been confirmed either. TheNew York Times, quoting unnamed sources, wrote on Oct. 16: “Investigators have not reached any conclusions about whether the information on the server was compromised or whether to recommend charges, according to the law enforcement officials.”\n\nManufacturing Jobs\n\nSantorum claimed that the U.S. has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under the Obama administration. It’s actually a net job loss of 243,000.\n\nSantorum made his statement while touting his economic plan, which he says will increase manufacturing jobs.\n\nSantorum: We’ve lost 2 million jobs — 2 million jobs — under this administration in manufacturing — 15,000 manufacturers have left this country. Why? Because of bad tax policy, bad regulatory policy and, yes, bad trade policy.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. had 12,561,000 manufacturing jobs in January 2009 when President Obama assumed office. The number of manufacturing jobs hit a low in February 2010 at 11,453,000 after 14 straight months of job losses — a loss of a little more than 1.1 million manufacturing jobs during that time.\n\nSince then, however, the U.S. has added manufacturing jobs, and as of September, it had 12,318,000 such jobs. That’s still 243,000 manufacturing jobs fewer than the U.S. had in January 2009, but not nearly the 2 million fewer that Santorum claimed.\n\nWe asked the Santorum campaign where the former senator got his data. We will update this item when we get a response.\n\nHowever, Santorum may be referring to a January 2015 report by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. In that report, the ITIF said that “there are still two million fewer jobs and 15,000 fewer manufacturing establishments than there were in 2007.” But that, of course, includes job losses under President Bush.\n\nWage Growth\n\nSantorum made a misleading statistical claim about wage stagnation.\n\nSantorum: In fact, the last quarter [had] the lowest wage growth ever recorded.\n\nIn fact, as we’ve written before, real weekly wages for rank-and-file workers have been rising nicely. Using the most recent figures, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “real” (inflation-adjusted) average weekly earnings of rank-and-file, nonsupervisory workers were 2.3% higher in September than they were a year earlier, and 8.7% higher than they were a decade earlier.\n\nSantorum may have been referring to a recent headline stating “Wage growth hits a record low,” which turns out to be misleading. The report refers to the BLS Employment Cost Index, which put the gain in wages and salaries of civilian workers for the April-June quarter of this year at 0.2%, the smallest three-month gain since the series began.\n\nBut Santorum failed to mention that this statistical series only began in 1982, a relatively brief historical record. Furthermore, the same index jumped up 0.7% in the first quarter of the year — and for the full 12 months ending in June the gain was a full 2%.\n\nFood Stamps\n\nJindal suggested a record number of Americans are getting food stamps, which is no longer true.\n\nJindal: Let’s be honest, $18 trillion dollars of debt. Record low participation rate in the workforce, record number of Americans on food stamps. We are going the way of Europe.\n\nActually, the number getting benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) has been declining for nearly three years as the economy has improved. It peaked in December 2012 at nearly 47.8 million, but had declined by 4.8% to fewer than 45.5 million as of July, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nCO2 Emissions\n\nPataki said that the U.S. is the only country to have reduced its CO2 emissions since 1995. That’s not true — other countries, particularly in Europe, have reduced their emissions over the same time period, some by a greater margin than the U.S.\n\nPataki: There’s one country in the world that has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the rest of the world. You know what that is? The United States. Our emissions are lower than they were in 1995.\n\nA spokesman for Pataki clarified in an email that he meant that “the U.S. is the only country in the world that actually emits less carbon than it did in 1995.”\n\nThe U.S. has reduced its CO2 emissions since 1995; according to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. emissions were about 5.32 billion metric tons in 1995, and 5.27 billion metric tons in 2012, the latest year with available data. But other countries have also seen CO2 emissions drop over that period.\n\nFor example, France’s emissions were about 373 million metric tons in 1995, and that fell to 365 million in 2012. Germany’s emissions fell from 891 million metric tons in 1995 to 788 million in 2012, a greater drop than the 50 million seen in the U.S. Italy, the United Kingdom, Nigeria and several other countries also saw emissions drop.\n\nImmigration\n\nSantorum said that “we’ve brought in 35 million — 35 million legal and illegal immigrants over the last 20 years, more than any period in American history.” The number of the foreign born now in the U.S. is the largest in sheer numbers, but several decades around the turn of the century saw higher percentages of the foreign born among the total U.S. population.\n\nSantorum said that 35 million immigrants had been “brought in” over the last 20 years. But we get a lower figure than that, using Census numbers, which show that 11,242,300 immigrants entered the country from 1990 to 1999, and 12,124,053 entered from 2000 to 2009. That’s a total of 23 million entering the country over 20 years.\n\nThe U.S. does have the highest number of foreign-born now — 42 million immigrants, 48% of whom are U.S. citizens. Santorum has made that claim before about the sheer number of the foreign-born.\n\nBut as we pointed out then, immigrants made up a larger share of the population in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The latest figures from Census show the foreign-born make up 13.3% of the total U.S. population. The share was higher or the same from 1870 through 1910. The peak was 14.8% in 1890.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Heilweil.

Kim Reynolds, R-Iowa., in the Republican Party's formal response to the State of the Union.\n\nReynolds accused Biden of bringing the nation back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, a time when \"runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing on our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nRead the whole story here: Republican rebuttal: GOP deploys campaign-style attacks on Biden's State of the Union speech\n\nWhat Biden said about Ukraine, COVID, the economy in his first State of the Union: full transcript\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. The roughly hour-long speech started a little after 9 p.m.\n\nBiden spoke about several of his administration's domestic priorities such as voting rights, combatting rising inflation, the electrification of the transportation system to fight climate change and other challenges facing the nation.\n\nHe also addressed Russia's ongoing invasion into Ukraine.\n\nHere's a transcript of Biden's speech.\n\nAnalysis: Biden seeks his footing as his agenda and the landscape are transformed\n\nEverything has changed.\n\nFor President Joe Biden, his State of the Union address Tuesday night was dominated by issues he had scarcely mentioned in his first speech to a joint session of Congress a year ago – issues of inflation at home and Russian aggression abroad, on which his presidency will now be judged.\n\nSpeaking at length and at times with emotion, the president described Moscow's invasion of Ukraine as a historic challenge to European stability and security that demanded a strong and united response. Even as Biden climbed to the dais in the House of Representatives, Kyiv was bracing for an all-out Russian assault that could lead to the occupation of the capital and the overthrow of the nation's democratically elected government.\n\nRead the whole story here: A world of change: Biden seeks his footing as his agenda and the landscape are transformed\n\nWho heckled Biden?\n\nA notable moment in the State of the Union came when Biden talked about talked about the flag-draped coffins of fallen service members, including his son, Beau, who died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\nAs Biden spoke about Beau, people inside the House chambers reported someone shouting, “You put them in there, 13 of them.\" After the comment was made, attendees in the chambers began to boo and groan at the comment, as Biden paused for a brief moment and continued his address.\n\nBoebert later confirmed on Twitter she in fact made the comment, in reference to the 13 U.S. soldiers who were killed in a suicide bombing attack at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport in August as the Taliban took over Afghanistan and Afghans attempted to flee the country.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden touts Justice Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nIn one of the more touching moments of Biden’s remarks Tuesday, the president briefly recognized Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced he will step down from the Supreme Court after nearly three decades.\n\nBreyer, holding his hands over his heart and, at one point, his face, appeared to be embarrassed by the attention. Breyer, who will retire in June, approached Biden after the address and the two spoke for several minutes and shared a laugh.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” Biden said to Breyer during the speech. “Thank you. Thank you.”\n\nBiden nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for Breyer’s seat on Friday, and the Miami native, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since June, has started to meet with members of the Senate who will vote on her confirmation later spring.\n\nThe president described Jackson as a “consensus builder” but made no mention, as he has in other venues, of what makes Jackson a historic candidate: She would be the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation’s highest court.\n\nAt 51, Jackson could serve on the Supreme Court for decades. Democrats are seeking to confirm Jackson by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nWho is Joshua Davis? Here's more about the 13-year-old who stole the show at State of the Union\n\nOf all the guests invited to President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address, one of the few mentioned was 13-year-old Joshua Davis. Davis, who is from Midlothian, Virginia, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was just 11 months old, according to the White House.\n\nAt the age of four, Davis began advocating for the Virginia General Assembly to make \"school safer for kids with Type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the seventh-grader at Swift Creek Middle School introduced President Biden at an event on prescription drug costs at a community college in Virginia.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden's report on the State of the Union: Strong\n\nThe president struck an optimistic tone in his concluding remarks, praising American values and calling the moment a \"test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\"\n\n\"It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged,\" he said. \"We will meet this test.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged while the country has faced a challenging period, he is \"more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\"\n\nThe president waited until the end of his speech, which lasted more than an hour, to deliver his report on the state of the union: \"strong.\"\n\n\"Because you, the American people, are strong,\" he said as the crowd erupted in cheers. \"We are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\"\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden says Americans can order more COVID tests from the government starting next week\n\nAmericans will be able to order more free coronavirus tests from the government starting next week, President Joe Biden announced during Tuesday's State of the Union address.\n\n\"Even if you already ordered free tests, tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week,\" Biden said, adding the government has made hundreds of millions of tests available for free.\n\nAmericans were able to start ordering the free tests from the Covidtests.gov website on Jan. 18.\n\n-- Kelly Tyko\n\nRead the rest here: Biden says Americans can order more COVID tests from the government starting next week\n\nBiden vows to address soldiers’ exposure to ‘burn pits’\n\nBiden announced that his administration is expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from respiratory cancers and promised to examine the issue of troops’ exposure to “burn pits.”\n\nBurn pits are used to incinerate jet fuel, medical materials and other wastes of war. Many soldiers who breathe smoke from them develop headaches, numbness, dizziness and even cancer, Biden said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.”\n\nBeau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\n“We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.”\n\n-– Michael Collins\n\nBiden: ‘Let's end cancer as we know it’\n\nBiden highlighted his announcement last month to relaunch the Cancer Moonshot, an issue close to the president’s heart after his son, Beau, died of brain cancer.\n\n“Let's end cancer as we know it,” he said.\n\nBiden noted that the fight to end cancer is personal for him and First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother died of colon cancer.\n\n“So many of you lost someone you love: Husband wife, son, daughter, mom, dad,” Biden added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nLawmakers react in the chamber following speech\n\nFollowing the speech, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., walked towards the front of the chamber to take a photo of Vice President Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"Most powerful ladies in the world,\" Gillibrand shouted as she took the picture.\n\nBiden was swarmed by lawmakers as he exited the chamber. Rep. Adam Schiff shook his hand, and Biden placed his hand on Schiff's shoulder. Others took selfies and photos with the president in the background as he spoke to members on his way to the exit.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden slams social media for effects on children\n\nBiden connected young people’s mental health to social media platforms, saying they must be held accountable for what he called a “national experiment” being conducted on children for profit.\n\nUnder the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration funneled millions into schools to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Children were also struggling before the pandemic,” he said “Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.”\n\n“It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children,” he said.\n\nProposals mentioned by the president include strengthening privacy protections, banning targeted advertising to children and stopping the collection of personal data on children.\n\nBiden also acknowledged Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen in the chamber and thanked her for her courage.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey, Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden: We can secure the border and fix the immigration system\n\nBiden renewed calls for immigration reform while also bolstering security at the U.S. southern border, remarks that drew chants of \"build the wall,\" from Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.\n\n\"And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system,\" Biden said. \"We can do both.\"\n\nThe president said the U.S. implemented new technology to better detect drug smuggling, set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch human traffickers and is supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nBiden also called for obtaining legal status for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented immigrations who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, as well as those who have temporary status, farm workers and essential workers.\n\n\"It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do,\" he added.\n\n-- Courtney Subramnaian\n\nBiden calls for ‘proven measures’ to reduce gun violence\n\nBiden vowed to cut down on gun trafficking and called on Congress to pass what he called “proven measures” to reduce gun violence.\n\nSpecifically, he urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and repeal liability shield that mean gun makers can’t be sued.\n\n“These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment,” he said. “They save lives.”\n\n–- Michael Collins\n\nBiden: Nominee Jackson a ‘consensus builder’\n\nBetween the crisis in Ukraine, soaring inflation and a stalled domestic agenda, Biden doesn’t have a lot of good news to tout at his State of the Union address this year.\n\nOne exception: His recently announced historic nominee to the Supreme Court, U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nBiden called Jackson “one of our nation’s top legal minds” and a “consensus builder.” Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president tried to signal bipartisan support for Jackson as she begins meeting with senators ahead of a confirmation hearing this spring.\n\n“Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support -- from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said.\n\nSenate Democrats hope to confirm Jackson to the high court by early April.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nBiden: Right to vote ‘under assault’\n\nBiden called on Congress to pass voting rights legislation, saying that the right to vote is “under assault.”\n\n\"The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted,” Biden said. “And it’s under assault.”\n\nHe added that he would like to see Congress pass the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Act.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan essential to keep neighborhoods safe, Biden says\n\nPresident Biden touted his American Rescue Plan as an asset to community safety.\n\nThe plan, which was approved by Democrats in Congress last March, provides $350 billion in direct aid to cities, states and counties that can be used to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.\n\n“We should all agree, the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to fund the police,” Biden said to cheers and applause.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nCOVID-19 reset\n\nBiden reflected on how COVID-19 has challenged the country since 2020, but that with roughly three-fourths of Americans fully vaccinated, and hospitalizations down by 77%, “most Americans can removed their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom and move forward safely.”\n\nThe president touched on how that has been the result of free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks. But Biden noted how this is a pivotal moment for Americans to stay focused in the face of the contagion’s possible resurgence.\n\n“Let’s use this moment to reset,” he said. “Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.”\n\nBiden noted how many lives have been lost, and that Americans cannot let the contagion divide them further.\n\n“We can’t change how divided we’ve been,” he said. “But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTracking COVID-19 vaccine distribution by state: How many people have been vaccinated in the US?\n\nBiden: End the 'partisan dividing line'\n\nIn his speech, Biden asked Republicans to stop using the COVID pandemic as a \"partisan dividing line\" – and to lower the temperature on a whole host of important issues.\n\n\"Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies,\" the president said, \"and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden: Bring an end to shutdowns of schools and businesses\n\nThe president called for bringing COVID-19-related shutdowns of schools and businesses to an end as the country moves into a new phase of living with the pandemic.\n\n\"It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office,\" he said. \"Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\"\n\nBiden also noted that with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their mask as they return to classrooms and offices.\n\nHe told the mostly maskless crowd that continuing his administration COVID-19 response efforts would cost more money and he intended to send Congress a request for more funds.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden outlines plans to lower deficit\n\nThe president urged lawmakers to confirm his nominees to head the Federal Reserve, calling it crucial to his plan to fight inflation.\n\nBiden said his plan is designed to “monitor and lower costs” and “give families a fair shot” while also lowering the deficit.\n\n“The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit, it undermined the watchdogs of those pandemic relief funds,” Biden said, and added that his administration reprioritized going after criminals who commit pandemic relief-related fraud.\n\nBiden also stated that he is the only president to have cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion dollars in a single year and vowed to even the economic playing field for Americans.\n\n“Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation,” Biden said.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden on COVID: ‘We’re moving forward’\n\nBiden said the United States has made progress to move past COVID-19, noting the updated mask guidelines issued by the CDC last week.\n\n“Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines,” he said. “We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n\n“COVID-19 need no longer control our lives,” he added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden vows to crack down on price gouging\n\nBiden announced a crackdown on companies that practice price gouging.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits, he said.\n\n\"I’m a capitalist,” he said. “But capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation – and it drives up prices.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n‘Secret ballot’ on taxes?\n\nBiden challenged Congress to adopt his plan at reforming the tax code, promising that under his plan no one earning less than $400,000 a year would “pay an additional penny in new taxes.”\n\n“I may be wrong but my guess is if we took a secret ballot on this floor that we’d all agree that the president tax system ain’t fair,” Biden said. “We have to fix it.”\n\nThe president’s remarks received a more lukewarm response, especially from congressional Republicans, who have resisted his idea.\n\nBut Biden’s pitch to the American people argued that his tax plan would grow the economy and doesn’t “punish anyone” but rather seeks to even the playing field by ensuring U.S. companies and its wealthiest individuals to “start paying their fair share.”\n\n“Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax,” Biden said. “That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.”\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSome Republicans take notes, joke to colleagues during Biden's speech\n\nSome Republican Senators appear to be taking notes on Biden's remarks, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., turned to Scott and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., and moved his hand up and down, appearing to point out Democrats standing up and down in applause, garnering laughter from his colleagues.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden calls for reviving plan for child care and universal pre-kindergarten\n\nThe president reiterated his longstanding call to cut the cost of child care for parents, pointing out that most American families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. A recent report by Child Care Aware of America found the price of child care has exceeded the annual inflation rate by 4 percent in 2020.\n\n\"Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children,\" he said.\n\nBiden's child care plan is part of his Build Back Better bill that was effectively killed after Sen. Joe Manchin announced late last year he wouldn't vote to pass it. The president also called for reviving plans to cut the cost of home and long-term care and creating a plan for universal pre-kindergarten for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden pushes for climate investments as part of his inflation pitch\n\nBiden called for several climate investments that he said will save families money as part of his efforts aimed at tackling rising inflation.\n\nThat included investment tax credits for Americans to weatherize their homes, doubling clean energy production and lowering the price of electric vehicles.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nBiden touts ‘revitalization’ of American manufacturing\n\nBiden praised what he said is the revitalization of the American manufacturing and said he agreed with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown that it’s time to bury the “Rust Belt” label.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories in the United States when just a few years ago they would have built them overseas, he said.\n\nFord is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country, he said. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nBiden said the revitalization is being driven by people like Joseph “JoJo” Burgess, a Pennsylvania steelworker who was seated in the first lady’s viewing box.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden called on lowering the cost of drug prices, such as insulin.\n\nThe president shouted out Joshua Davis, a 13-year-old with diabetes, who attended the address.\n\n“For Joshua & the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it,” Biden said.\n\nHe added that he spoke with Joshua’s mom about how hard it's been to afford the drug.\n\n“Imagine what it's like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God's name you're going to be able to pay for it,” Biden said.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\n'It is legal extortion': Diabetics pay steep price for insulin as rebates drive up costs\n\nBiden aims for investment in Intel, competitiveness with China\n\nIntel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, recently unveiled plans to build a $20 billion complex outside of Columbus, Ohio, a move Biden hailed as a major sign of progress in his administration's work to boost U.S. production of the critical microchips at a time of rising competition with China.\n\n“That's why it's so important to pass the bipartisan (Innovation and Competition Act) in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing,” Biden said. The president also acknowledged Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was invited to the speech.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden: We can cut inflation by making more things in the U.S.\n\nBiden said one way to reduce inflation – one of his biggest political problems – is to make more products in the United States, reducing rely on blocked supply chains.\n\n\"Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America,\": he said.\n\nThe president was not very specific about how to do that; Republicans say his proposed environment regulations will choke industry.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden touts ‘infrastructure decade’\n\nShifting from Ukraine, Biden touted his American Rescue Plan legislation and infrastructure law, the latter of which he got support from Republicans to pass in the evenly divided Senate.\n\n“I want to thank members of both parties who helped make it happen,” Biden said. “We’re done talking about infrastructure week. We’re talking about the infrastructure decade.”\n\nHe pointed to broadband expansion, roadway and bridge repairs and lead pipe replacement among the projects that will be funded.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says Putin ‘will never gain the hearts’ of Ukrainians\n\nBiden said that Democracies are “rising to the moment” as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin may be able to circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people,” he said. \"He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: U.S. to release 30 million barrels from Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nBiden said the U.S. is working with 30 countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around world to ease the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy markets.\n\nThe U.S. is leading the effort by releasing 30 million barrels from its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he said.\n\n“These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home,” he said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nStanding ovation for Biden’s vow to defend NATO countries\n\nDespite Russia’s devastating attack on Ukraine, President Biden reiterated support in the form of economic sanctions, not the deployment of U.S. troops, to the vulnerable area.\n\n“We have mobilized American ground forces, air squadron, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. And as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power,” Biden said.\n\nHis remarks received a standing ovation from lawmakers in the chamber.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nWhat is NATO?: Military alliance in spotlight as Russia tries to forbid Ukraine membership\n\nBiden: Sanctions are strangling Putin's Russia\n\nBiden outlined a strict set of sanctions meant to choke the Russian economy in retribution for Putin’s invasion.\n\n“Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more,” he said.\n\nThe president, who praised Ukraine’s resolve on the battlefield, said the Justice Department is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian’s wealthiest people. He pledged that the U.S., along with European allies, will look seize Russian yachts, luxury apartments and private jets.\n\n“We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” Biden said.\n\nAmerica has seen immediate dividends with its economic sanctions and $1 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to the president, who said that along with closing U.S. air space to all Russian flights the Ruble has lost 30% of its value; its stock has dipped by 40% and trading with the foreign country has been halted.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nBiden says 'no more' to Russian oligarchs, announces closure of US airspace to Russian aircraft\n\nBiden said the U.S. and western allies are enforcing \"powerful economic sanctions,\" including cutting off Russia's largest banks from international financial systems, preventing Russia's central bank from shoring up the Russian ruble and \"making Putin's $260 billion war fund worthless.\"\n\nHe announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights, joining a growing number of countries around the world that have made similar moves in recent days.\n\nThe president also said coordinated sanctions are \"choking off Russia's access to technology\" that will weaken its military and undermine its economic strength.\n\nU.S. and European sanctions also target Putin and his inner circle as well as Russian oligarchs.\n\n\"Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,\" he said. \"We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\"\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nPutin more ‘isolated from the world’ than ever, Biden says\n\nBiden hailed the united response of the U.S. and western allies against Russia President Vladimir Putin as Russia continues its war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden called the attack “premeditated and totally unprovoked,” adding that Putin thought he could divide the world.\n\n“But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united,” Biden said. “Now that he’s acted, the free world is holding him accountable.”\n\n“Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been,” he said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says Ukraine “inspires the world”\n\nBiden said during his speech that the Ukrainian people are inspiring the world as they face Russia’s attacks.\n\n“(Putin) thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined,” Biden said.\n\n“He met the Ukrainian people,” Biden continued. “From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden arrives at House chamber\n\nBiden was introduced in the House chamber at 9:05 p.m. and walked into the room to a loud chorus of cheers.\n\nBiden shook hands of several lawmakers seated along the aisle and chatted briefly with a few of them as he made his way to the rostrum, where he will deliver his remarks.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJill Biden, Cabinet members have arrived for SOTU\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden entered the House chamber with her guests for this evening's speech, including the Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S.\n\nThe group stood and applauded as the president's cabinet entered the chamber next. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, a former member of the House, blew kisses as she walked down the aisle, before taking her place next to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Fudge is sitting across the aisle from Supreme Court Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nSome lawmakers noticeably absent from State of the Union\n\nAs President Biden addressed lawmakers and the nation Tuesday, the absence of some who were invited to the speech did not go unnoticed.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio said during a February appearance on conservative news network Newsmax that he would not attend due to the COVID-19 testing mandate and that he would watch replays of the speech on television.\n\n\"I'm just tired of all that COVID theater crap,” Rubio said.\n\n“Same,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy tweeted Monday in response to a post about Rubio’s absence. “I will not attend.”\n\nFour other Republican members of Congress, Mary Miller, R-Ill., Bob Good, R-Va., Matt Rosendale, R-MT and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., told Newsmax Tuesday they would also skip the speech due to health safety precautions.\n\nAt least five Democratic lawmakers, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. And Ted Deutch, D-Fla., tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the address.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nFive Supreme Court justices show for speech\n\nBiden is getting something for his State of the Union address that’s been hard to come by for much of his presidency: a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, joined by four associate justices, filed into the House chamber before the president's remarks Tuesday, the first time five members of the nine-member court have appeared for a presidential address to Congress since President Donald Trump’s remarks in 2017.\n\nIn addition to Roberts, Associate Justices Stephen Breyer -- set to retire in June -- Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are attending the address, taking their traditional front-row seats.\n\nBiden has had a series of setbacks at the nation's highest court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 advantage. A majority of the justices sided against the administration’s COVID-19 eviction moratorium in August. Last month, the court blocked a requirement that large companies implement vaccine-or-testing mandates to fight the virus.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nMembers sporting Ukraine flags and colors\n\nThere are signs of support for Ukraine in the House chamber.\n\nUkraine-born Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN 05) is wearing a yellow dress and blue blazer, the colors of Ukraine.\n\nSome other members on the floor are holding small Ukrainian flags, including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the House GOP conference chair.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden leaves White House for Capitol\n\nBiden pulled out of the White House in the presidential motorcade at 8:32 p.m. EST to make the short drive to the Capitol.\n\nThe president is expected to arrive in just a few minutes.\n\nPennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol is lined with American and Ukrainian flags in a show of support for Ukrainians amid Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nDesignated Survivor State of the Union: Gina Raimondo\n\nAnd the lucky Cabinet member is ... Gina Raimondo\n\nThe Commerce Secretary is being held back from the State of the Union in case disaster strikes the U.S. Capitol and she has to assume the presidency.\n\nThe concept of the \"designated survivor\" has fascinated entertainers for years.\n\nThriller writer Tom Clancy used an attack on the U.S. Capitol as a plot device in one of his Jack Ryan novels (Ryan became the president).\n\nThere was also a television show based on the idea. Its title: \"Designated Survivor.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nMembers of Congress in the chamber ahead of SOTU\n\nMembers of Congress have begun to gather in the House chamber ahead of Biden’s remarks.\n\nMany, but not all, are taking advantage of the new Congressional guidelines on mask usage, which no longer requires that they wear a mask in the chamber during the State of the Union.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke with Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, before walking across the House aisle to speak to Chair of the House Appropriations Committee Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.\n\nMembers are assigned seats this evening, separated by one empty seat between, but ahead of the remarks most are gathered talking in small groups around the floor.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nThese are the Dems who will escort Biden at his State of the Union address\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi named seven Democratic members of the House to the Escort Committee for tonight’s State of the Union, who will help escort President Biden to the House chamber.\n\nThe members of leadership on the committee are Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Chairman of the Democratic caucus Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the head of the House Democrats campaign arm, will also serve on the committee, as will Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio is also part of the group. Kaptur is the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden will call on Congress for DOJ Task Force resources in SOTU\n\nPresident Biden will use his State of the Union address to ask Congress for resources for the Justice Department’s COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to expand prosecutions of pandemic fraudsters, the White House announced.\n\nBiden will also ask Congress for more serious penalties for criminals who commit fraud related to pandemic relief.\n\nThe DOJ has already prosecuted cases where PPP loans meant for small businesses undergoing difficulties due to the pandemic were fraudulently obtained and where unemployment insurance was stolen by identity thieves.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nThese are the twelve Representatives with prime aisle seating at the SOTU\n\nSix Democrats and six Republicans have the premium aisle seats that allow close proximity to President Biden as he enters the House chamber to deliver his remarks.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, Benny Thompson of Mississippi and Mark Takano of California have the seats on the Democratic side.\n\nGOP Reps. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, Gary Palmer of Alabama, Kevin Brady of Texas, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, and Debbie Lesko of Arizona are the Republicans on the aisle.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden to issue executive order on identity theft in public benefits programs\n\nBiden is set to speak on a new executive order targeting identity theft during the State of the Union.\n\nThe order, which will expand upon steps taken in 2021 to prevent and detect identity theft of public benefits and direct new actions to support fraud victims, will be announced in the coming weeks, according to The White House.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden to announce new chief prosecutor to pandemic relief crimes\n\nBiden will roll out new efforts to prevent identity theft and other pandemic-related fraud crimes during the State of the Union, according to the White House, including the addition of a chief prosecutor to the Justice Department’s COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force.\n\nThe COVID-19 task force was implemented by Attorney General Merrick Garland in May 2021 and has charged over 1,000 criminal cases and opened over 200 civil investigations across 1800 individuals and entities involving billions of dollars in suspected fraud.\n\nThe new chief prosecutor will help prosecute reports of identity theft involving public pandemic benefits from 2019 to 2020, as reported by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n--Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden to say ‘defund the police’ is not the answer\n\nAmid rising crime in cities across the nation, albeit from historical lows, President Joe Biden will tout his administration’s efforts to fund local police departments and to tackle gun control during Tuesday’s State of the Union, according to the White House.\n\nBiden will highlight how he’s urged local and state governments to use American Rescue Plan funds to add police officers. He’s also expected to urge Congress to pass his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.\n\nRepublicans have sought to tie Biden and other Democrats to the “defund the police” mantra on the left, even though Biden has repeatedly rejected that phrase.\n\n“He'll make clear that the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to put more police – with better training and more accountability – out to take back our streets and make our neighborhoods safer,” a White House official said.\n\nAlthough Republicans in the Senate have refused to pass sweeping gun reform measures, Biden will point to his administration's unilateral efforts. That includes creating five new Justice Department gun trafficking strike forces to target the illegal; an executive order aimed at “ghost guns,” and new ATF rules.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nU.S. to close airspace to Russian planes\n\nBiden will announce in his State of the Union address that the U.S. is closing its airspace to Russian planes in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three sources told USA TODAY.\n\nThe U.S. joins a growing list of countries that have announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the invasion.\n\nThe E.U. banned all Russian aircraft from its airspace after several European countries including France, Italy and Denmark as well as Canada announced the move Sunday. Neutral Sweden and Austria also joined the international move to cut off Russian aircraft.\n\n– Michael Collins and Courtney Subramanian\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union address?\n\nBiden will start speaking at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere can I watch the SOTU?\n\nIt will be carried by all major TV news networks (CBS, NBC, ABC and PBS) and cable news networks including Fox News, Fox Business Network, CNN, MSNBC and C-SPAN.\n\nNPR will also carry the address.\n\nThe speech will also be live-streamed by the White House and many organizations, including USA TODAY. Readers can follow live updates on the speech from USA TODAY.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden's State of the Union guest list\n\nPer tradition, first lady Jill Biden will sit in the House gallery with a group of distinguished Americans to watch her husband deliver his State of the Union address.\n\nIn addition to Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Biden's guest list includes people who work in education, health care, technology, and a steelworkers union.\n\n\"The President and I are honored to welcome an extraordinary group of Americans and H.E. Oksana Markarova, Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States, to sit with me and @SecondGentleman for the State of the Union,\" Mrs, Biden tweeted.\n\nThe White House posted the full guest list.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nGOP, Dems to wear Ukrainian colors\n\nBrandishing Ukraine’s flag colors will be a bipartisan affair during Biden’s first State of the Union address, as several members from both parties plan to either wear ribbons or other clothing in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.\n\nRepublican Rep. Victoria Spartz, of Indiana, who was born in Ukraine, will wear a blue suit and yellow blazer to draw attention to the crisis. She took to Twitter ahead of the president’s remarks calling on the Biden administration to do more.\n\n“Putin’s war is not a war but a genocide of the Ukrainian people who wanted to be free and with us,” Spartz said. “We cannot let him embarrass our great nation and slaughter these brave people under our watch.\"\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, of Kentucky, showed off how dozens of members from both parties had gathered on the Capitol steps before the address with a flag merging the U.S. and Ukrainian colors.\n\n“Today I joined my colleagues to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people,” Guthrie, a Republican, said. “Their bravery in the fight against Putin's unlawful and unprovoked invasion is inspiring. I support sending more aid to Ukraine and crushing Putin and his associates with a powerful arsenal of sanctions.”\n\nThe Democratic Women’s Caucus earlier Tuesday announced its members plan to “wear bright and colorful attire” in support Ukraine.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSOTU comes as inflation soars\n\nBiden delivers his State of the Union address at a time when inflation has soared to its highest level in four decades.\n\nConsumer prices jumped 7.5% last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest year-over-year increase since February 1982, the Labor Department reported last month. The increase was driven by shortages of supplies and workers, heavy doses of federal aid, low interest rates and robust consumer spending, the department said.\n\nThe steady surge in prices has left many Americans less able to afford food, gas, rent, child care and other necessities.\n\n-- Michael Collins, Associated Press\n\nCongresswoman to pass out ribbons to show Ukraine solidarity\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, will pass out blue and yellow ribbons to members of congress at Biden’s State of the Union to “wear tonight in solidarity with the people of Ukraine,” the Democratic Women’s Caucus said.\n\nKaptur is leader of the Ukraine Caucus.\n\nIn addition, some congresswomen were seen wearing blue and yellow, the color of Ukraine’s flag, in a photo posted by Michelle Moreno-Silva, communications director of the Democratic Women’s Caucus.\n\nMoreno-Silva said members of the Democratic Women’s Caucus are planning to “wear bright and colorful attire to the State of the Union in celebration of the strength and diversity of the Caucus.”\n\nThe caucus first asked members to don white at the 2019 State of the Union in honor of the Women's Suffrage Movement that led to the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920. The lawmakers wanted to acknowledge voters who gave Democrats a majority in the House that year.\n\nThe tradition continued in 2020 in protest \"against President Trump's backwards agenda.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin and Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden to deliver speech as Russian convoy inches toward Kyiv\n\nBiden's State of the Union speech comes on day six of Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the international crisis is expected to be a focal point of his speech.\n\nA 40-mile convoy of Russian tanks and vehicles appeared to stall about 15 miles outside of Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. Troops appeared to run out of gas and food, but it's also possible the Russians are pausing to regroup and reassess their attack, a senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Tuesday.\n\nUkrainians are bracing for continued attacks after at least 11 people were killed and 35 others wounded in an apparent rocket strike in Kharkiv. Earlier, Russian strikes hit Kyiv's main broadcasting tower and the nearby Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial site, where Nazis killed thousands of Jews during World War II. Ukraine's foreign minister confirmed the attack.\n\nAhead of his remarks, Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more than 30 minutes. The president said he discussed continued U.S. support, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, and vowed to hold Russia accountable.\n\nFor more updates on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, follow USA TODAY's live coverage here.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nWhat will Biden talk about?\n\nBiden’s remarks to a joint session of Congress will give him a chance to trumpet his administration’s accomplishments during his first year in office and lay out policy goals for the coming year.\n\nA prominent Democratic strategist urged Biden to use the opportunity to offer Americans hope for better days.\n\n“What Americans want to hear is genuine understanding of what we have been through together and a clear path forward – less about Mr. Biden’s accomplishments than about the heroic, unsung sacrifices so many have made to see their families and communities through,” David Axelrod, who helped shape many of President Barack Obama’s addresses to Congress, wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times.\n\nWhat else is bound to come up? Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will cast a long shadow over Biden’s State of the Union address. Biden will seek to reassure the country that it's entering a new phase in the fight against COVID-19. And the president wants Americans to know that he feels their pain when it comes to rising prices.\n\nRead more here on expectations for the address.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to address Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nBiden will address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine during his address, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks released by the White House.\n\n“Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising,” he is expected to say.\n\n“That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\n“It matters. American diplomacy matters.\n\n“Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And, he thought he could divide us here at home.\n\n“Putin was wrong. We were ready,” he will say.\n\nBiden to talk about inflation and the US economy\n\nBiden will also address inflation — an issue that is a top concern for the American people -- according to prepared remarks released by the White House.\n\n“We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation,” he is expected to say.\n\n“Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America.\n\n“Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” I call it building a better America,” he will say.\n\n“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” he is expected to say.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden speech focus: The U.S. and Europe must be united against Russia\n\nPreviewing his State of the Union speech to a group of journalists, President Joe Biden said he will stress the importance of unity between the United States and Europe in confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a lunch with television anchors and others, Biden said he would re-emphasize \"my determination to see to it that the EU, NATO, all of our allies are on the same exact page in terms of sanctions against Russia and how we deal with the invasion – and it is an invasion – of Ukraine.\"\n\nThis from a tweet by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who also reported that Biden declared global unity \"the one thing that gives us power to impose severe consequences on Putin for what he’s done.\"\n\nPresidents host these kinds of lunches with television anchors before every State of the Union address. The sessions are off the record, but White Houses often put a few comments on the record.\n\nIn this case, Biden wanted to make clear his message on Ukraine.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden will roll out mental health crisis strategies\n\nBiden will outline his plan for tackling the mental health crisis during his first State of the Union.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Biden will call on Congress to pass legislation to support those policies that increase the capacity of the mental health system to provide care, make it easier for those who need care to get it and address the determinants of health.\n\nAmong the policies he will pitch, according to the White House:\n\nA plan to spend $700 million on training, scholarship and loan repayment for those who pursue careers in mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural communities and other underserved areas.\n\nA proposal that health plans cover \"robust behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers, including three behavioral health visits each year without cost-sharing.\"\n\nTo address concerns about digital technology and social media damage to the mental health of young people, Biden wants to ban targeted advertising for children online and stop online algorithms from returning results that damage their mental well-being.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nPelosi won’t be wearing a mask during State of the Union\n\nAs she sits behind President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be mask-less.\n\n“I’m not going to be wearing a mask tonight,” Pelosi told MSNBC Tuesday. “If I had little children, or if I were around little grandchildren I would because some of them would not be vaccinated.”\n\nDemocratic House leadership lifted its mask mandate in the House in time for the president’s first State of the Union. It comes as the rate of positive COVID-19 test results dropped to 2.7% at the Capitol’s testing site, according to Politico, and as the District of Columbia dropped its indoor mask mandate as COVID-19 cases have plummeted in Washington.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday ended its mask requirement for vaccinated staff members. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said she hadn’t spoken to Biden on whether he will wear a mask when he walks into the House Chamber.\n\n“He will certainly not be wearing a mask when he's speaking,” Psaki said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat was the shortest State of the Union? the longest?\n\nWhich presidents delivered the longest and the shortest State of the Unions? It depends on your measuring stick.\n\nBased on word count, President George Washington’s delivered the shortest speech on record in 1790, before the annual message was even dubbed the State of the Union. Washington’s speech to a joint session of Congress measured in at 1,089 words, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nNot every president has delivered an oral message, however. After President Thomas Jefferson eschewed a speech in favor of a written message to Congress in 1801, it took more than a century before President Woodrow Wilson revived the tradition of an in-person speech in 1913.\n\nDating back to 1964, the shortest oral delivery of a State of the Union was President Ronald Reagan’s 31-minute speech in 1986, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Congressional Research Service noted that speech still had a word count about three times as long as Washington’s inaugural annual message.\n\nThe longest written message to date belongs to President Jimmy Carter, who delivered a 33,667-word written State of the Union in 1981. In his final State of the Union in 2000, President Bill Clinton set the high watermark for an in-person speech at just under 90 minutes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s 80-minute average is the longest of all presidents dating to 1964, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWhy is this Biden’s first State of the Union?\n\nThe concept of an annual update from the president to members of Congress has existed as long as the presidency. President George Washington delivered the first of what was then called the “Annual Message” in 1790.\n\nThat is rooted in the constitutional requirement to provide an update “from time to time.” The speech was not formally named the State of the Union until 1947, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut recent tradition has been for presidents to not deliver a formal State of the Union in the year they were inaugurated but instead to simply speak before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did that in 2021, as the six presidents before him had done in their inauguration years. That means Biden’s 2022 address will be his first formal State of the Union.\n\n– Rick Rouan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

Phil Scott this week to write letters to bar owners in the state to remind them of COVID-19 compliance rules.\n\nThis comes after four Burlington bars received written warnings accusing them of breaking rules put in place through an executive order signed by Scott. These rules were set to ensure health and safety within bars during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nScott's letter also informs bar owners that the Department of Liquor and Lottery would be conducting compliance checks to ensure they are following the rules, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nWeinberger has expressed concern about these violations, saying that COVID-19 transmission can easily occur in bars. He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday.

Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

The grant comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. COVID-19 has disrupted many services of support and recovery for Vermonters struggling with mental health issues and substance abuse.\n\n________\n\nStarting tomorrow, June 19, Vermont will begin the opening of long-term care facilities, according to the Vermont Department of Health. These facilities can allow two guests per resident per day, so long as those visits occur outside and follow social distancing protocols.\n\nVermonters over 65 will no longer be required to stay home. The Health Commissioner suggests that those individuals do continue to take safety precautions if they choose to leave their homes.\n\n________\n\nOne new death related to COVID-19 was reported Thursday by the Vermont Department of Health. The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County. Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

Only one in five people associated with the outbreak are reporting symptoms — the number of asymptomatic individuals is thought to be a contributing factor to the spread of the virus in the community.\n\nThere have been no deaths associated with the outbreak, the state reported.\n\n__________\n\nGuidance is underway to prepare Vermont schools across the state to tentatively open by Labor Day, announced Gov. Phil Scott in a press briefing Wednesday.\n\nHealth and safety measures for school districts are being developed by the state's Agency of Education and the Health Department, in collaboration with other Vermont educational organizations and pediatricians, and will be formally announced by next week.\n\n\"it's critical we finalize a plan now so we can reopen in the fall,\" said Scott.\n\nAmong the objectives of the guidance is to decrease the risk of COVID-19 entering school, being transmitted between staff and students, and ensuring students with certain needs are \"addressed in a fair and equitable measure\".\n\nProvisions could include social distancing on busses, daily temperature screenings at bus stops and school entrances, increased testing and tracing capacity, and mandatory dismissals if students or staff display any symptoms.\n\n\"It's likely we'll have to change or amend this guidance in the coming months,\" said Dan French, secretary of the Agency of Education.\n\n\"We're also preparing to improve our ability to provide remote learning as a contingency.\"\n\n__________\n\nRegistration is open for Vermonters seeking meals from distribution sites across the state this month.\n\nPick up sites are scheduled on these days in these areas , with more sites to be added for the remainder of June:\n\nMiddlebury area: June 10\n\nBrattleboro area: June 11\n\nMorristown area: June 12\n\nLyndon area: June 15\n\nGrand Isle County: June 16\n\nRandolph area: June 17\n\nDover area: June 18\n\nChittenden County: June 19\n\nPeople can register online at humanresources.vermont.gov/food-help or over the phone via 2-1-1.

Baby alligators have been reported in parking lots on the causeway that crosses Mobile Bay and along heavily traveled U.S. 98 in Daphne, WKRG-TV reports, so the city posted notes on social media asking residents to be careful, particularly with pets. Charles Epler of Wildlife Solutions, an animal removal services, said the sightings likely were linked to the weather. “They get pushed out. That heavy, torrential rain washes them out of where they’re at, and then they’re going to try and find somewhere else to set up shop,” Epler said. Daphne, a city of about 26,000, is located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. “About 83% of their diet in the wild is turtles. I think that’s why there’s so many over here in Daphne,” Epler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A bus that people sometimes embarked on deadly pilgrimages to visit can now safely be viewed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks while it undergoes preservation work. The bus was moved to the school’s engineering facility last week while it’s being prepared for outdoor display at the Museum of the North, television station KTVF reports. The abandoned Fairbanks city bus became a shelter for hunters and others using the backcountry near Denali National Park and Preserve, but it was a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. During his last days he kept a journal that was discovered when his body was found. McCandless’ ordeal was chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild,” followed later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name. People from all over the world made the bus a focal point and tried to retrace his steps. The state removed the bus located about 25 miles from the town of Healy after two women from Europe drowned on homages to the bus. There were 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, the state Department of Natural Resources said in August 2020 when the bus was flown out of the wilderness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Documents and training materials from the Arizona Department of Corrections’ servers contain images of a skull with a sword through it that experts liken to gang and white supremacist symbols. Corrections experts say the designs may offer a window into the mindset of the department’s Special Operations teams, reflecting an us-against-them mentality and members acting out militaristic fantasies, rather than rehabilitating prisoners. PowerPoint presentations featuring the skull and sword emblem also define the imagery. “Skull = Death before dishonor,” a slide says, while the shotguns are “tools of the trade,” and the eyes of the skull, embellished with gun sights, indicate: “We are always watching you.” Set to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” a training video depicts special operations teams responding to riots at the Yuma and Kingman prisons. The video contains graphic images of the aftermath, including zip-tied prisoners, officers using dogs to intimidate prisoners, blood-stained walls and floors, and nonlethal weapons used on inmates. Prisoners alleged special operations officers committed civil rights abuses in the aftermath of the deadly riot at the Yuma prison in March 2018. Thirty-seven people were injured, one prisoner died, and six officers were fired and criminally charged for destroying prisoner property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday effectively approved a new law that will allow employees to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, a move by fellow Republicans to challenge federal vaccine mandates. Hutchinson allowed the measure to become law without his signature despite his concerns about the impact it will have on businesses in the state. The new law won’t take effect until early next year. In Arkansas, a bill becomes law after it sits on the governor’s desk for five days without any action. Governors have traditionally used that approach to express opposition to legislation without prompting a veto fight with the Legislature. Hutchinson said the amount of time before the opt-out law takes effect gives the state more time to weigh its impact on businesses and for any court challenges to be filed. But he also called the proposal unnecessary and counterproductive. “The debate on these bills has been harmful to our goal of increasing vaccination rates in Arkansas,” he told reporters. The measure requires employers to allow workers to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies. Health officials have said antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity, those who’ve recovered should still get vaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A wildfire raging through Southern California coastal mountains threatened ranches and rural homes and kept a major highway shut down Wednesday as the fire-scarred state faced a new round of dry winds that raise risk of flames. The Alisal Fire covered more than 22 square miles in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara, and the number of firefighters was nearly doubled to 1,300, with more on the way. Containment remained at 5%. While the scenic region along the Pacific shoreline is lightly populated, the blaze was a threat to more than 100 homes, ranches and other buildings, fire officials said. Fire crews were protecting Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. The 688-acre ranch where Reagan hosted world leaders sits atop the mountain range, above the flames feeding on dense chaparral and grasses. The area hadn’t burned since 1955, according to the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation, which now operates the ranch. Crews also protected an Exxon/Mobil gas processing facility in a canyon surrounded by flames. The fire erupted Monday near the Alisal Reservoir and swept down through the mountains, forcing the closure of U.S. 101. At one point, the fire jumped the highway and reached a beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will include gender confirmation care in its individual and small-group health insurance plans, state and federal officials announced Tuesday. The state’s plan under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will include jaw, cheek and eye modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast or chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal. Additional health benefits for Colorado’s plan include an annual mental health exam and expanded coverage of opioid alternatives for pain management, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said. The new plan adds 15 drugs as alternatives and will cover up to six acupuncture visits per year, according to the Colorado Division of Insurance. The changes will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Colorado’s request to provide gender-confirming care as part of the state’s “essential health benefits,” which are requirements for individual and small-employer plans set forth under former the Affordable Care Act. Christy Mallory, legal director at the Williams Institute, a research institute based in the University of California Los Angeles’ School of Law, said without insurance, much of gender-confirming care is “prohibitively expensive,” so Colorado’s move increases access to medically necessary care for trans people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: President Joe Biden plans to visit the University of Connecticut on Friday for the dedication of a human rights center named after former U.S. Sens. Thomas and Christopher Dodd. The Dodd Center for Human Rights serves as an umbrella home for the school’s human rights programs and archives. Those include the Human Rights Institute, which houses the largest undergraduate and graduate human rights program at a public university in the U.S., and Dodd Impact, which focuses on community-based human rights initiatives. It had been known as the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center since its opening in 1995, named for the late senator who also was a lead prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II. UConn’s Board of Trustees voted in August to change the name to the Dodd Center for Human Rights to recognize the work of both Democratic senators and their family. “I’m deeply grateful to UConn for recognizing me and my family by dedicating the Dodd Center for Human Rights, and I’m honored that my good friend President Biden is joining us to mark this occasion,” said former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is Thomas Dodd’s son. He served as a senator from 1981 to 2011, gaining a reputation as a human rights advocate for his work to end abuses in Central America.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Auditor Kathy McGuiness turned herself in to authorities and pleaded not guilty to corruption charges Tuesday morning. Accompanied by her attorney, McGuiness entered the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center just before 10 a.m. to turn herself in to Delaware Capitol Police. Steve Wood, her attorney, told the court in a brief hearing that she pleaded not guilty to the charges, including felony theft and intimidation, as well as public service misdemeanors like official misconduct. The basis of the charges is that she violated conflict-of-interest laws by arranging a job for her daughter and her daughter’s friend in the auditor’s office, that she rigged public payments to a campaign consultant to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and that she sought to spy on and intimidate those who questioned her conduct. McGuiness and Wood opposed prosecutors’ request that she be barred from speaking about the case to her daughter. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney argued that Elizabeth McGuiness is an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a witness. But “to say to a mother that you may not talk to your young daughter about probably the most traumatic event that has occurred for either of them in their lives is unnecessary and inhumane,” Wood argued to the court. The judge sided with McGuiness’ attorney and denied the request.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington National Cathedral formally dedicated a new stone carving of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in a ceremony Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The carving, completed in April, shows Wiesel’s likeness inside the cathedral’s Human Rights Porch, which features carvings of leading human rights defenders throughout history, including Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Jonathan Daniels and Eleanor Roosevelt. The dedication was a collaboration among the cathedral, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. “From surviving the Holocaust to becoming one of the world’s leading lights in preserving the memory of that unspeakable tragedy forevermore, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Elie Wiesel,” Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said. “It is an honor to have his memory and his legacy included in our Human Rights Porch so he can serve as a reminder of the consequences of hate, as well as the resiliency and indomitability of the human spirit.” Wednesday’s ceremony featured remarks from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and author John Meacham, who is canon historian of the cathedral. A survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps, Wiesel told his story to millions through his autobiographical novel “Night.”\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A statue of Black educator Mary McLeod Bethune will be on display for two months in the city before heading to its permanent home in the U.S. Capitol, where it’s replacing a sculpture of a Confederate soldier as one of two statues from the Sunshine State in the building’s National Statuary Hall. The 11-foot marble statue of Bethune, a civil rights leader and adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was unveiled Monday at the News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach. The statue depicts Bethune, a founder of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, wearing a graduation cap and gown and holding a black rose. Early next year, Bethune will become the first Black woman represented in the National Statuary Hall, where each state has two likenesses of prominent native sons and daughters. “The sculpture is a gleaming representation of what is possible with unyielding tenacity and dogged determination,” Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said. The statue of Bethune replaces one of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Confederate monuments across the country have fallen in recent years amid contentious debate over whether they are proud monuments to Southern heritage or hated symbols of racism and past slavery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit alleging fraud in the state’s most populous county during the 2020 election. The suit sought a review of some 147,000 absentee ballots to see if any were illegitimate. Originally filed in December, the lawsuit that alleged evidence of fraudulent ballots and improper ballot counting in Fulton County was filed by nine Georgia voters and spearheaded by Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of the state’s election systems. Henry County Superior Court Chief Judge Brian Amero’s order dismissing the case said the voters who brought the suit “failed to allege a particularized injury” and therefore lacked the standing to claim their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process had been violated. Amero also noted that Georgia’s Secretary of State’s Office had provided a “substantive and detailed response” to his request for an update on any investigations into allegations of fraudulent or counterfeit ballots in Fulton County. Favorito expressed frustration after the ruling, saying his team had “prepared diligently to show the evidence of our allegations” at a hearing the judge had previously scheduled for Nov. 15. Angered by his narrow loss in a traditionally red state, former President Donald Trump had focused his fury on Georgia and particularly on Fulton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has not experienced a large spike in evictions despite the expiration of state and federal moratoriums meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect renters during the pandemic’s economic downturn. Tracey Wiltgen, executive director of the Mediation Center of the Pacific, said her organization has handled more cases in recent months but not as many as she anticipated, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Between Aug. 7 and Oct. 2, the center opened 565 eviction cases for mediation – fewer than the 1,000-1,500 cases it had expected. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wiltgen said, the center mediated about 200 eviction cases per month. A state-level moratorium ended Aug. 6. A few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal moratorium that was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. David Chee, an attorney who mostly represents landlords, said some cases are being kept out of court because tenants are choosing to leave their units without fighting the eviction. “A lot of tenants have just run away,” Chee said. “So once the moratoriums were done, a lot of tenants, as soon as they figured out their landlords were going to evict them, just simply left.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday that he wants to use federal coronavirus relief money to increase day care capacity to help alleviate the state’s worker shortage. The Republican governor, in a speech about the future of work that was followed by several questions, said expanding day care could help get more workers back in the workforce. Idaho’s current unemployment rate of 2.9% puts the state back at pre-pandemic levels last seen in early 2020, a span that includes a period of double-digit unemployment as COVID-19 spread and jobs evaporated. But now, many employers can’t find enough workers. “We know part of that is parents who are staying home,” Little said. “We think we can take some one-time money and build some (day care) capacity.” The U.S. Department of Labor has said the national unemployment rate last month dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Officials said 194,000 people found work, a tepid number and evidence that the pandemic remained a problem, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs. Idaho has had problems with the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, with the state currently on crisis standards of care due to so many unvaccinated patients filling hospitals. Crisis care standards mean scarce resources such as intensive care beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The head of a police union has called on its members to defy the city’s requirement to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday or be placed on unpaid leave. In the video posted online Tuesday and first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara vowed to take Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to court if it tries to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by the end of the workweek. After Friday, unvaccinated workers who won’t submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing will be placed on unpaid leave. Catanzara suggested that if the city does enforce its requirement, and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up.” In the video, Catanzara instructs officers to file for exemptions to receiving the vaccine but not to enter that information into the city’s vaccine portal. He said that although he has made clear his vaccine status, “I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody, let alone that information about your medical history.” During a news conference Wednesday, Lightfoot accused Cantazara of spreading false information and dismissed most of his statements as “untrue or patently false.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Monroe County officials are buying part of a site dotted with old limestone quarries for a possible tourist destination despite chemical contamination found in the area. The Monroe County Council this past week approve the $370,000 purchase of nearly 30 acres near Bloomington just northwest of the Interstate 69 and Indiana 46 interchange. County leaders have discussed over the past couple years buying about 100 acres of wooded former quarry property with the idea of building trails, exhibits about the limestone industry and an outdoor concert venue. Tests by an Indiana University researcher have found low contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in sections of the quarry site not yet purchased by the county. Several sites around Bloomington contaminated with the toxic industrial chemicals have faced multimillion-dollar cleanups since the 1980s. County Council member Kate Wiltz said the proposed park project could acknowledge the negative impact of industrial pollution on the community while being a tribute to the area’s limestone heritage. “I think that’s a side of parks and public lands that we don’t often promote, but that’s every bit as important reason to purchase and steward the property,” Wiltz said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: With the threat of a United Auto Workers strike looming, Deere & Co. managers told employees at factories across the state not to come in Wednesday. Workers said managers ordered third-shift employees in Waterloo not to report to work at their usual 11 p.m. start time. Employees at the company’s Ankeny and Ottumwa plants said Deere also canceled their second shifts. Employees are working under a contract that expires Friday, but the UAW told Deere that its 10,100 members will go on strike Thursday morning if the two sides cannot reach a tentative agreement. Workers have not gone on strike against Deere since 1986. UAW International spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said Wednesday that his team was looking into reports of temporary layoffs. “We’ve gotten no formal notification about anything,” he said. In addition to plants in Ankeny, Ottumwa and Waterloo, the UAW represents Deere workers in Davenport and Dubuque, as well as in Illinois and Kansas. The Waterloo plant, with about 3,000 members, is Deere’s largest. On Sunday, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed six-year contract with Deere that would have raised wages and bolstered current employees’ retirement payments while ending traditional pensions for new hires, who would participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has passed an ordinance aimed at banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. After four months of delays, the council voted 6-1 to approve the measure Tuesday, the Wichita Eagle reports. Council member Jeff Blubaugh cast the lone dissenting vote. Council members rejected a proposed exemption that would have allowed religious groups to fire or refuse to hire LGBTQ individuals, an amendment proposed by council member Jared Cerullo, the first openly gay man to serve on the council. Cerullo said the proposed amendment would help bridge the divide between religious groups who opposed it and those who wanted it. But council members Becky Tuttle and Cindy Claycomb said it would “dilute” the ordinance. The measure seeks to prohibit discrimination based on age, color, disability, familial status, gender identity, genetic information, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, veteran status or any other factor protected by law. The city will begin accepting complaints under the ordinance Jan. 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee who has played a key role in pushing for President Joe Biden’s agenda to expand the nation’s social safety net, announced Tuesday that he will not seek another term in next year’s election. At age 74, Yarmuth – first elected to Congress in 2006, when he unseated a Republican incumbent in his Louisville-area district – said he wanted to spend more time with his family. The congressman is the 10th Democrat to announce plans to retire ahead of the 2022 election. Although the district he represents has become increasingly blue, the retirement of a Democrat in a senior leadership position sends yet another ominous sign about the party’s chances heading into next year’s midterms, when its thin majority in both U.S. chambers will be at stake. The party that wins control of the White House typically loses congressional seats in subsequent elections. Yarmuth is the only Democrat in Kentucky’s six-member U.S. House delegation. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top-ranking Democrat in the GOP-controlled state Senate, quickly announced he’d run for the seat. State Rep. Attica Scott was already waging a primary challenge against Yarmuth, and his son, Aaron Yarmuth, said he is weighing throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billionaire Richard Branson said it was an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime experience to don a drum major’s uniform and march ahead of a New Orleans high school band. But some of the Catholic school’s fans apparently were less enthusiastic about Branson’s appearance last week with the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 – the band that integrated an exclusive Mardi Gras parade. The band and Branson paraded to a new Virgin Hotel in New Orleans as part of opening ceremonies Thursday. “I’ve had quite a few exciting experiences in my time, but I’ve never got (a) chance to lead a marching band before – let alone the best marching band in the world,” Branson wrote on his blog Friday. “What an honour to join the legendary St. Augustine High School band for a performance through the streets of New Orleans.” Aulston G. Taylor, president and CEO of the school, tweeted a letter late Sunday acknowledging that many people had told him only students who have earned it should be allowed to wear the purple and gold uniform. Others felt that “Sir Branson adorning our drum major uniform with honor across his millions of followers was great for the school and sets us apart as a global brand,” he wrote. He said both viewpoints are valid.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Republicans in the state Senate want to return to taxpayers a portion of the surplus that accumulated during the pandemic, thanks in part to historic federal assistance. The “Give It Back” plan is seen as a major piece of the GOP’s messaging push ahead of the 2022 legislative session and comes as former Republican Gov. Paul LePage seeks to unseat current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, the Bangor Daily News reports. The plan calls for splitting unused monthly revenue, sending half to the state’s rainy day fund and half to taxpaying residents. The proposal is in line with LePage’s campaign promise of eliminating Maine’s income tax if he wins in 2022. Mills has overseen a healthy state budget during her time as governor despite higher spending. A spokesperson for her administration called the GOP proposal a tacit acknowledgement of the state’s good fiscal situation under Mills’ leadership, according to the newspaper. Maine Republican legislators have fought with Mills over the $1 billion in federal relief that was used to bail state government out during the pandemic. Party leaders have called the aid excessive.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s public schools are using software that alerts officials when a student using one of the system’s laptops might be considering suicide. Since March, GoGuardian’s Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools’ coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students’ home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently because school-owned laptops may be their only devices. “Privacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,” said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. “Student activity monitoring is quite widespread.” Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times, and school police went to homes 12 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A rare two-headed diamondback terrapin turtle is alive and kicking – with all six of its legs – at the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center after hatching a little over two weeks ago. A threatened species in the state, this turtle is feeding well on bloodworms and food pellets, staff at the center said. The two heads operate independently, coming up for air at different times, and inside its shell are two gastrointestinal systems to feed both sides of its body. The turtle originally came from a nest in West Barnstable that researchers determined was in a hazardous location and needed to be moved. After hatching, turtles in these so-called head start nests are sent to different care centers to be monitored before their release in the spring. Center veterinarian Pria Patel and other staff members will continue to monitor the turtle, which they nicknamed Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen after the twins who rose to prominence as child actors, beginning with “Full House” in 1987 when they were babies, and now are the famously elusive designers behind fashion label The Row. The staff is hoping to perform a CT scan to learn more about the turtle’s circulatory system.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Backers of former President Donald Trump will launch a ballot drive to require a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election, rallygoers were told Tuesday. Jon Rocha, of Portage, a Republican who is running against U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, said he expects paperwork for the legislative initiative to be filed with the Board of State Canvassers next week. “This is how a revolution begins,” Rocha told several hundred people gathered on the state Capitol lawn. If about 340,000 valid signatures are collected, and the measure is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, “it is absolutely veto-proof,” Rocha said. “That’s the best part about it.” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “cannot stop this bill.” Should lawmakers fail to act on the measure, it would go to voters at the November 2022 election, he said. Though ill-defined, a “forensic audit” is the phrase that has been embraced by large numbers of people unhappy with the result of the 2020 presidential election, in which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump, a Republican. Biden won 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and by more than 7 million popular votes. Biden prevailed in Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. Several private donors have agreed to help fund the effort, Rocha said. He would not name them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Moccasin maker Minnetonka is publicly apologizing for making money off Native American culture and promised to do more to support Indigenous communities in the future after 75 years in business. In a statement posted Monday on Minnetonka’s website, CEO David Miller said the company is not a Native-owned business. He noted the Minneapolis-based firm acknowledged its appropriation in summer 2020 but said this public apology was long overdue. “We deeply and meaningfully apologize for having benefited from selling Native-inspired designs without directly honoring Native culture or communities,” Miller said. The company timed the apology to coincide with Indigenous Peoples Day. To better address the needs of the Native American community, Minnetonka said it has hired Adrienne Benjamin – a Minnesotan, Anishinaabe, and a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe – as a reconciliation advisor. The company said it’s also making a concerted effort to improve diversity, equity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and will seek out more partnerships with Native-owned businesses as vendors and suppliers. In the past year, it has done business with two different Native-owned companies, the company said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students who left college at least two years ago without a degree can apply for a grant to help them return to and finish school. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently awarded the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning $1.3 million to fund the state’s Complete 2 Compete tuition assistance grants through 2023. The Complete 2 Compete program provides one-on-one support for adult learners who have earned college credits – but not a degree – and works with them to complete their education. Qualifying returning students can receive a $1,000 grant that can be renewed every semester. The award helps pay for any coursework needed to graduate and can help repay prior debt. Funds can be used at any Mississippi public universities or community colleges. A total of 2,400 students have graduated since the program launched in 2017. More than 200,000 prior students qualify for the Complete 2 Compete program, according to a press release from the Mississippi Community College Board. Since May, the program has reached out to former students through postcards as well as internet and social media ads. More than 2,700 former students’ applications were processed over the summer, with 620 returning to enroll in one of 15 community colleges, eight universities and a medical center.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has struck down the state’s requirement that a majority of the owners of companies that dispense, grow or manufacture marijuana must be Missouri residents. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey last week issued a permanent injunction against the residency requirement, The Kansas City Star reports. She had issued a temporary injunction in June. Missouri voters approved creation of a medical marijuana industry in the state in 2018. One of the regulations required that state-licensed marijuana cultivation plants, dispensaries and manufacturing facilities must be at least 51% owned by people who had lived in Missouri for at least one year. Mark Toigo, a Pennsylvania-based investor, filed a lawsuit last December challenging the requirement, arguing that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in a statement that the agency is “happy to have clarity on how we should handle the ownership residency requirement in the Missouri Constitution and will comply with the court’s decision.” The health department oversees the medical marijuana program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging a new state law banning voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in certain areas of college campuses. The lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party, Montanans for Tester and University of Montana student Macee Patritti is one of several challenging the law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people, who typically favor Democratic candidates. The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues the law “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. Patritti, a 19-year-old freshman, registered students to vote at the Montana Technological University in Butte as an intern with the Montana Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 election, according to the court filing. The plaintiffs argue that her First Amendment rights to political expression would be curtailed under the new law, which would prohibit such activities.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has announced a five-year ban on Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for student conduct code violations following a report of a sexual assault at the fraternity’s house in August. The report led to a protest of about 1,000 people outside the fraternity house Aug. 25 and sparked similar protests on college campuses around the country. The UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta – better known as Fiji – was temporarily suspended in late August while the university investigated possible violations of a previous probation. The university said Tuesday in a news release that an investigation by the University Conduct Board showed violations had occurred and that Fiji is no longer recognized by the university. The fraternity is suspended from the Lincoln campus at least through 2026, the release said. Fiji was already on probation for previous violations of university policy when the assault was reported. That report is still being actively investigated by the University Police Department, according to the university.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state’s top election official is challenging the status of two ballot measures that Nevada’s largest teachers union promised to withdraw after successfully using them as bargaining chips and pressuring legislators to boost education funding. In a Sept. 7 letter first published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske wrote that state law required she include measures that propose raising taxes on sales and gambling on the 2022 ballot. Neither Democrats nor Nevada’s powerful resort industry want the tax measures to appear before voters next year, both have said. Democrats worry their inclusion could allow Republicans to frame the election around taxes. And resorts and casinos do not want to risk a hike that could deter tourists from visiting Las Vegas. The initiatives originated almost a year ago, when the Clark County Education Association submitted the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to qualify the two proposals for the 2022 ballot. John Vellardita, the teachers union’s executive director, said in March that the measures were designed to “start a conversation” about education funding and said they’d remain on the ballot unless lawmakers increased education funding before adjourning in June, which they did.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday rejected $27 million in federal funds for vaccination outreach, thrilling outspoken activists who previously derailed a public meeting and delayed the vote. Several were arrested Wednesday after audience members repeatedly interrupted the debate. Among other things, the money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and address public concerns about them. Opponents argued the grant language would have required the state to comply with any “future directives” issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates. The same language has appeared in other grants accepted by the council, a five-member body that approves state contracts. And it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty, said both Attorney General John Formella and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. “I appreciate that you have concerns, but they’re based on fantasy,” Sununu told Councilor Joe Kenney. All four of the Republican councilors voted against the grants. “You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?” the governor said. “That is completely un-American.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: The state has awarded a contract to replace a century-old rail bridge that has been the source of regular delays for years, officials announced Tuesday. The $1.56 billion contract is the largest in NJ Transit’s history, CEO Kevin Corbett said in a statement. The board of directors approved a joint venture by Sweden-based Skanska and Traylor Brothers, a civil construction company based in Evansville, Indiana. Construction is expected to take about five years. The Portal North Bridge is to replace a 111-year-old swing bridge over the Hackensack River that occasionally becomes stuck after it opens to allow boats to pass and must be manually hammered back into place. The new bridge will allow marine traffic to pass underneath without interrupting rail traffic. The project completed its design phase and received environmental approvals several years ago but languished while New York and New Jersey officials squabbled with the Trump administration over dividing up the costs between the states and the federal government. “Few infrastructure projects are as critical to the nation as replacing the aging Portal Bridge,” Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: After seven years of mining, federal officials say work to carve out the eighth disposal area at the U.S. government’s underground nuclear waste repository is complete. Managers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are planning to use the space beginning next year. Workers still need to run power to the excavated area known as Panel 8 and install air monitors and chain link to protect the walls. Constructed in a deep layer of salt in southern New Mexico, the repository entombs the radioactive remnants of decades of nuclear research and bomb-making. That includes special boxes and barrels packed with lab coats, rubber gloves, tools and debris contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive elements. Having enough space for the waste became more of an issue in 2014, when a radiation release contaminated parts of the underground facility and forced an expensive, nearly three-year closure. Some parts of the repository became off-limits. State regulators currently are weighing a permit change that some critics say could open the door to expanded operations at the repository. A decision is expected this year. In operation for more than two decades, the repository has received nearly 13,000 shipments. The idea is that the shifting salt will eventually encapsulate the waste after the underground vaults are filled and sealed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A $2 billion project to build a rail link to LaGuardia Airport was officially put on hold Tuesday, after weeks of criticism from public officials and a lawsuit from neighborhood and environmental groups. In a news release, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it is pausing the project to consider alternatives. In recent weeks, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had criticized the project, championed by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area through which the link would pass, also has spoken out against it, as has outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Federal Aviation Administration issued environmental approval in July but recently had asked the Port Authority to reconsider in light of a lawsuit filed by neighborhood and environmental groups. Preliminary construction on the roughly $2 billion, 1.5-mile elevated link was to begin this year. Public transit officials have sought for years to build a rail link to LaGuardia, one of the few major U.S. airports without rail service. Critics had opposed the plan, saying it would negatively impact Queens neighborhoods and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving, as it would involve taking a train or subway from points east or west to a stop serving CitiField, home of the New York Mets, then switching to the rail link.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A jail violated regulations requiring guards to observe inmates at least twice an hour, according to a state agency probing the deaths of two inmates last spring. On May 22, John Devin Haley, 41, of Charlotte, was found hanging below his cell window at the Mecklenburg County jail with a strip of blanket tied around his neck, The Charlotte Observer reports. Haley had a history of addiction and mental health problems when he entered the jail April 3 and was temporarily placed on suicide watch, according to jail records. Karon Golightly of Gastonia died at the jail May 14. Five months later, the cause of his death has not been made public, the newspaper reports. In North Carolina, jailers are required to observe each inmate “at least twice an hour on an irregular basis, with no more than 40 minutes between rounds,” according to state regulations. That standard was repeatedly violated in the hours leading up to the two deaths, according to investigators with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. A DHHS report obtained by the newspaper says 52 minutes elapsed between the time Golightly was seen healthy and being discovered in distress in another inmate’s cell. The state also pointed to a camera near where Golightly collapsed that apparently was malfunctioning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Budget writers in the Legislature began mulling proposals Tuesday on how to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid the state received this year. House and Senate appropriations committees met separately in all-day meetings at the Capitol, listening to pitches from fellow lawmakers and others on a wish list that totaled $9.2 billion – significantly more than the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in June. The meetings, attended heavily by lobbyists, were the first in a series being held this month to prioritize projects ahead of a Nov. 8 special session, when the full GOP-led Legislature will debate the proposals. The $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus funds represents the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history. The money currently is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ray Holmberg and his counterpart in the House, Jeff Delzer, said priority for the funding will be given to water, sewer and infrastructure projects, for which there is an immediate need, and those that won’t require a commitment of funds from taxpayers in the future.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recreational marijuana would be legalized for adults 21 and older under Republican legislation coming in the state House that would levy a 10% sales tax on the product, a lawmaker announced Tuesday. Ohio facilities currently producing and processing medical marijuana would be grandfathered into the program, with new producers to be added to meet the expected demand, said Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Lake County. He said he’s currently looking for co-sponsors for the legislation, which has been in the works for months. The bill “is the responsible approach for adult use,” Callender said. A quarter of the sales tax revenue would go to police departments to purchase equipment used in detecting impaired drivers and another quarter toward addiction and recovery programs. The remaining 50% would not be earmarked, which could help the state during a precarious economic time, Callender said. In addition to the legislation being announced Tuesday, a separate ballot issue to legalize marijuana use and sales in Ohio is underway. A spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which proposed that statute, said Tuesday that the group applauded Callender’s plan and said it continues to welcome the chance to work with the Legislature on passing a recreational marijuana bill.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A retired New York attorney is suing the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, saying its claim to have no records pertaining to the drugs it plans to use in upcoming executions “defies belief.” Fred Hodara, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, is asking the court to compel the corrections department to comply with his open records requests for documentation of its execution plans. He said in his lawsuit that in response to his requests for the records, including some the department is legally required to keep, the department told him none exist, the Tulsa World reports. “In light of the scope and nature of the requests, the assertation defies belief,” the lawsuit said, arguing that the agency has a history of refusing to search for and produce records that are subject to the state’s Open Records Act. A department spokesman told the newspaper that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Oklahoma is preparing to execute John Marion Grant on Oct. 28. It would be the state’s first execution since 2015, when then-Gov. Mary Fallin put a moratorium on capital punishment following the execution of Charles Warner with a drug that wasn’t authorized to be used that way.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Republican state lawmaker Bill Post has announced his resignation from the Legislature after saying he misunderstood the residency requirements for being in office when he moved out of Oregon. His resignation announced Tuesday will be effective Nov. 30. Post previously said he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022 but said Tuesday that he would resign after “discussions with an elections attorney.” Post, a former talk radio host, has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2015. He and his wife moved to Fallon, Nevada, which is east of Reno. In a Sept. 27 Facebook message, Post said his wife accepted a job, and they had sold their Keizer house and bought one in Fallon. He said he’d be in the district “at least once per month.” “My intent was to be open with my constituents about my move out of state and the steps I’d be taking to continue to fulfill my duties for the rest of my term to the best of my knowledge and ability,” Post said in a statement. Republican precinct committee members from House District 25 will select three to five candidates to replace Post. County commissioners from Marion and Yamhill counties will then choose a candidate to serve out the remainder of Post’s term. A Republican has held the seat since 2003.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Love was unexpectedly on the court docket when a man accused of murder made an unusual request of the judge who will preside over his trial. Kashawn Flowers’ lawyer on Tuesday asked York County Judge Harry Ness whether he’d consider marrying Flowers and his girlfriend. Attorney Brian Perry acknowledged it was the first time he had ever made such a request. Flowers is accused of gunning down a man in York in August 2014. His girlfriend would not be a witness at the trial, his attorney said. Prosecutors did not object, and neither did the judge. But the marriage is on hold until after the trial. “We’ll take care of it next week,” the judge said. Flowers remains held in the county jail without bail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A series of controversial murals at a school have been painted over following criticism that they depicted children of color in a disparaging light. Among the four painted panels at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School, only one shows children with different skin tones together, while the others show varying races separated. Two white children are shown playing on a beach in one scene, while two Black children build a snowman in another. Meanwhile, in a separate image, other children of color tidy up the school and collect trash. City Councilman David Salvatore said he received complaints about the murals, focusing in part on their apparent themes of inequality and segregation, and held community meetings on the issue. Initially, Salvatore explored the idea of removing the murals, preserving them and putting them on display, though he said it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. Eventually, the murals were painted over just before the school year began. Considerations for a new mural will be made. The city’s decision generated backlash from state Rep. Anastasia Williams, who said the paintings represented desegregation and anti-racism to her. Officials have been unable to find any mention of the murals in city archives; it’s only known that they were painted decades ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two civil rights groups are suing the state, saying lawmakers are taking too long to draw new maps for U.S. and state House districts. Candidates are required to file to run for the 2022 races by the end of March, but time is running out for potential candidates to research the new districts and settle any lawsuits asking judges to decide if the new maps are fair, according to the suit. It was filed Tuesday by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups are asking a panel of three federal judges to set a specific timeline for maps to be drawn and approved and not allow any elections until the new districts get judicial approval. The suit said lawmakers should have kept to suggestions when they adjourned in June that there would be a special session in September or October to approve maps. Those plans became less firm as lawmakers dealt with the aftermath of a budget provision that prevented districts from passing mask requirements this school year. South Carolina Senate President Harvey Peeler called for an Oct. 12 special session last month but canceled it about a week later, saying a committee working on the school district issues wouldn’t be finished in time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Zoo officials say COVID-19 may have killed a snow leopard. The animal, named Baya, died at the Great Plains Zoo on Thursday of a respiratory illness that might have been COVID-19. Coronavirus test results are pending. The snow leopard began coughing Oct. 3. By Oct. 4 she was acting lethargic and wouldn’t eat. Zoo veterinarians gave Baya antibiotics Thursday, but she was in critical condition later in the day. Baya was 21/ 2 years old and had been at the zoo since early 2021. Officials had hoped she would mate with another snow leopard named Strut. Zoo officials said Monday that an Amur tiger at the zoo tested positive for the virus Oct. 6, the day before Baya died. Five other big cats at the zoo have shown COVID-19 symptoms, including Strut. Most of the animals have been on antibiotics and are improving, said Matt Eschenbrenner, the zoo’s director of animal care and conservation. He said the zoo hopes to bring in another snow leopard to replace Baya, but it’s unclear when that animal might arrive. “We can’t even think about bringing in another animal until we know everything has passed and our animals are healthy, 100%,” Eschenbrenner said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Three U.S. Postal Service workers died in a shooting spree at a sorting facility Tuesday, including a supervisor, a manager and a letter carrier temporarily assigned to the postal annex, relatives and co-workers said. Two workers were fatally shot by a third who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service didn’t immediately name those involved. The postal facility reopened Wednesday. Laquita Benjamin, president of the local branch of the National Association of Postal Supervisors, said those killed were a carrier, a supervisor and a manager. “You can’t just relate it to the Postal Service because you have school shootings, store shootings – you have shootings all over,” Benjamin said. A family member identified one of the dead as James Wilson, a manager at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in Orange Mound, a historic Memphis neighborhood. “He was a humble soul, one of the nicest supervising managers you could ever wish there was,” Roxanne Rogers said of Wilson, her cousin. Rogers, herself a postal worker, said Wilson had just returned to the annex after filling in at a different location. Melvin Richardson, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 96, said the annex is only used by employees.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched an investigation into allegations of widespread mistreatment at the state’s embattled youth lockups, where at least 11 staffers have been arrested on sexual abuse charges in recent years. The move by the Biden administration is the latest sign of trouble for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which for more than a decade has been beset by scandal, staff shake-ups and investigations into allegations of abuse. Just last week, a former coach at a West Texas facility was arrested on charges alleging that he touched the breast of an 18-year-old in custody. The announcement comes a year after advocates in Texas filed a complaint with federal investigators that outlined “grave problems” at the state’s five youth lockups. Texas put more than 800 youths in state juvenile detention in 2019 – more than any other state – according to an agency report published in September. “Being subjected to harmful conditions does not rehabilitate children; it only leads to worse life outcomes,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Spokespeople for the state agency and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In July, Abbott ordered a new investigation into the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Apple CEO Tim Cook and NBA All-Star Dwayne Wade joined Utah leaders Wednesday to announce the completion of a local advocacy group’s campaign to build new homes that provide services for LGBTQ youth in the West. Encircle, a nonprofit providing mental health services for LGBTQ youth, has surpassed its goal of raising $8 million to build eight new homes with locations in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah aimed at providing safe spaces and preventing teen suicide. “Encircle’s mission is very personal to me because I see myself in so many of these young people,” Cook told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. “It’s not easy when you’re made to feel different or less than because of who you are or who you love. It’s a feeling that so many LGBTQ people know far too well.” Wade, who joined the Utah Jazz ownership group in April, shared his experience as the parent of a transgender child and voiced his support for Encircle’s mission. “I stand here as a proud parent of a beautiful daughter that’s a part of the LGBT+ community,” Wade said. “I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know everything, but I’m willing to listen.”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A dam built at the end of the 18th century has been fully removed after it was abandoned and contributed to flooding that threatened nearby homes in central Vermont. The removal of the Dunklee Pond dam started in 2019 and was completed in the past month, WCAX-TV reports. In the decades after it was built, the dam powered industries including a linseed oil mill, a wood planing mill, a metal mill, a slate pencil mill and a tannery, the broadcaster reports. More recently, it was used as a skating rink and swimming hole. “In the ’50s, ’60s, there were photos of the people diving, jumping off the dam, off the wall up here, swimming, fishing,” said Todd Menees of the Vermont Rivers Program. But the dam deteriorated, and Rutland City Fire Chief Bill Lovett said if it failed, it would have threatened dozens of homes downstream, and a bridge over a busy roadway could have been destroyed. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the city of Rutland coordinated the project, using about $500,000 of state and federal funding. The project removed sediment that accumulated behind the dam, which the city of Rutland will use for road repairs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The family of a slain journalist is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Facebook for failing to remove online footage of her shooting death. Andy Parker said the company is violating its own terms of service in hosting videos on Facebook and its sibling service, Instagram, that glorify violence. His daughter, TV news reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward were killed by a former co-worker while reporting for Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV in August 2015. Video footage of the shooting – some of which was taken by the gunman – repeatedly resurfaces on Facebook and Instagram despite assurances from top executives that it will be removed, according to a complaint filed Tuesday by Parker and attorneys with the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. “The reality is that Facebook and Instagram put the onus on victims and their families to do the policing of graphic content – requiring them to relive their worst moments over and over to curb the proliferation of these videos,” the complaint said. It said Facebook is engaging in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service and misrepresenting the safety of the platform and how hard it is for users to get harmful and traumatic content removed.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The pace of the 20-acre Rattlesnake Ridge landslide in central Washington near Union Gap is continuing to slow, officials said. Yakima County emergency services director Tony Miller said measurements taken in August show the slab is moving less than 2 inches each week, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. In 2020, the slab was sliding 2 to 3 inches each week. The slab is expected to continue sliding south, with debris depositing in a nearby quarry. “It’s moving a little bit, crumbling and falling right into the pit,” Miller said. State and county officials, as well as scientists, have been monitoring the slide since a crack was spotted on the ridge in 2017. Initially, officials said the slide could pose an immediate danger, and 60 people living nearby were evacuated. Some residents returned after an assessment firm hired by the state confirmed the landslide was not likely to rapidly slip. Stephen Reidel, a research faculty member at Washington State University, said the slab is sliding on a sedimentary layer between basalt flows. As the basalt slides into the quarry, it will stack up and eventually build up enough to act as a barrier, stopping the landslide. “It’ll just stabilize itself and then stop moving,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Employers would be limited in their ability to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under a bill introduced by Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday. The proposal, which would allow certain medical and religious exemptions to company vaccine mandates, comes as the state approaches 4,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Employers would be barred under the bill from penalizing or discriminating against current or prospective employees for pursuing the exemptions. The bill, which covers businesses and state government agencies, was advanced in the state Senate on first reading Wednesday. In the House of Delegates, it was referred to a committee. Justice, a Republican, lifted an earlier indoor mask mandate in June and opposes any new mask or vaccine mandates. Businesses can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, “but at the same time they need to allow for these exemptions,” Justice said at a news conference. Under the bill, a doctor or nurse can provide signed documentation that the employee has a physical condition preventing them from safely receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or that the worker has recovered from COVID-19 and can show they have antibodies for the coronavirus. The worker also can present a notarized certification for a religious exemption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans brought in rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent on Wednesday to publicize a package of bills that would declare open hunting season on sandhill cranes and allow anyone 18 or older to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Nugent appeared with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, including state Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, inside the Assembly chamber. The musician and conservative activist said that “hunting is essential, and any regulation that doesn’t deal with safety or science-based wildlife management is an obstacle to participation.” The package of 13 bills is making its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. Even if they passed, to become law they would need the approval of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who would likely veto many of them. Nugent, who lives in neighboring Michigan, is the national spokesman for Hunter Nation, a group that outraged conservationists when it won a court order forcing an unprecedented late-winter wolf hunt in Wisconsin during the animal’s breeding season. The proposal to create a sandhill crane hunting season mirrors another that died in 2012 in home state of the International Crane Foundation. Nugent said in addition to population control, sandhills are tasty. “Are you familiar with the term ribeye?” he said. “They’re ribeyes in the sky.”\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Trustees at the University of Wyoming say they’ll continue a policy requiring masks in indoor campus spaces where social distance can’t be maintained, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Only about 40% of students have confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/letters/2023/07/24/my-religion-is-the-reason-im-voting-in-favor-of-issue-1-letters/70420230007/", "title": "My religion is the reason I'm voting in favor of Issue 1 | Letters", "text": "Letters to the editor\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story included a letter that made an incorrect claim about absentee ballot postage.\n\nI am impressed by the number of \"Vote No on Issue 1\" yard signs that I see in the otherwise Republican-leaning community where I reside.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window.

The Arsenal defender has been “a beacon of calm at the back” and has “set the tone with everything she did”.\n\nWilliamson insists that the players are now fully focused on winning the trophy. “It is about doing our job on the pitch,” said the 25-year-old. “That’s the most powerful thing, the biggest way we can contribute, and that is what we are focusing on.”\n\nWiegman’s toughest test yet\n\nSunday will represent England’s third appearance in the competition’s final, said Sky Sports.

She led her native Netherlands to victory in 2017. Since Wiegman’s appointment in September the 52-year-old has steered her team to a stunning 16 wins and only two draws, said the Daily Mirror. The England “gaffer” now faces her “toughest test since taking the top job”.\n\n1.

England player to watch: Beth Mead\n\nEngland’s Beth Mead opened the scoring against Sweden (Image credit: Dave Howarth/CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nThere have been many standout performances from the Lionesses at these Euros: Alessia Russo’s impact and goals from the bench, Mary Earps’s saves in between the sticks, and captain Leah Williamson’s assured defensive displays to name just three.\n\nOne of the players to really shine has been Arsenal’s Beth Mead. The forward has netted six goals so far in the tournament, including a brilliant opener against Sweden in the semi-final. The golden boot is “well within sight”, said Sky Sports. Mead has matched the record for most goals in a single Women’s Euros, set in 2009 by former Germany striker Inka Grings.\n\n5. Germany player to watch: Alexandra Popp\n\nGermany captain Alexandra Popp scored twice against France (Image credit: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images)\n\nWith both goals in the 2-1 semi-final win against France, Germany captain Alexandra Popp became “the first player in the tournament’s history to score in five successive games”, said the BBC. The VfL Wolfsburg striker, 31, is “making up for lost time” after injuries, said Nick Ames in The Guardian. Alongside England’s Beth Mead, she is currently the joint-top scorer in the tournament and “could complete the fairytale” at Wembley.\n\n6. Pundit predictions: who will win the final?\n\nThe Lionesses are going “from strength to strength” and have shown “no signs of being impacted by the added pressure of hosting the tournament”, said Matt Verri in the London Evening Standard. Germany have only conceded one goal all tournament “so it is unlikely to be the kind of comfortable win that England produced against Norway and Sweden”. But Wiegman has “transformed” the mentality of the side – “they are ready to go all the way”. A 2-0 England win.\n\nHere we have the “finest” teams in the tournament going “head to head at a full Wembley Stadium”, said Michael Potts in the Radio Times. “It doesn’t get much better than this.” The game “really could swing either way”, and you “can’t rule out a demolition job from either team given their form so far”. Potts thinks this will come down to “one magical moment”. Prediction: England 1-0 Germany.\n\nFinals are often “tight, cagey encounters”, said Greg Lea on WSN.com. At the final of the men’s European Championship last summer, England took an early lead against Italy but “failed to capitalise on it”. England’s women “will not make the same mistake”.\n\nThe “psychological power” of the home support will give the England players a huge boost as this final goes on and “fatigue starts to take hold”, said Alex Sarwar on The Stats Zone. “Therefore, in what should prove an unforgettable spectacle, consider backing England to end their major trophy drought and lift the Euro 2022 trophy.”\n\nWith “almost nothing” to separate the sides, we back the Women’s Euro 2022 final to “go down to the wire”, said Football Today. “Don’t be surprised if the winner is decided after penalties.”\n\n7. Betting odds: winners, golden boot and first scorer\n\nThe bookies make England slight favourites to win the Women’s Euros ahead of Germany. According to Oddschecker.com the Lionesses are 7/5 while the Germans are 2/1. Alexandra Popp and Lea Schuller of Germany and Ellen White and Alessia Russo of England are favourites to score the first goal in the final.\n\nIn terms of the golden boot race, England’s Beth Mead is 11/10 to end as the tournament’s top goalscorer. Germany’s Alexandra Popp is priced at 5/1 and Mead’s teammate Alessia Russo is 66/1. Mead and Popp are currently level on six goals, while super-sub Russo has four.\n\nAll prices as of 12pm on Friday 29 July.\n\nFirst goalscorer odds", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/05/ballon-dor-2025-rankings-list-who-will-win-uefa-nations-league-game-today-what-time-watch-stream-tv/84047807007/", "title": "Ballon d'Or 2025: Who will win UEFA Nations League semi finals ...", "text": "Who will win the Ballon d'Or 2025?

She led her native Netherlands to victory in 2017.\n\nLegacy programme goals\n\nBefore and throughout the tournament Wiegman has spoken about how the Lionesses had aimed to “inspire the nation” at their home Euros. When asked in the post-match press conference if the win over Sweden was a statement to their rivals, she said: “Yes, I think so. We said we’re ready to write history and this is it.”\n\nWhen England won the bid to host this year’s tournament, the Football Association (FA) said it hoped that the major event would “inspire positive change” and develop the women’s and girls’ game in Sheffield, Rotherham, Manchester, Trafford, Wigan and Leigh, Milton Keynes, London, Southampton and Brighton & Hove.\n\nAs part of the FA and Uefa’s Women’s Euro 2022 legacy programme, the three main goals were to “give access for all girls to play football in school and clubs”; create a diverse workforce of coaches, referees and local leaders “delivering and organising football for their communities”; and provide inclusive, safe and welcoming environments for “every woman and girl to play competitive or recreational grassroots football, irrespective of ability, disability, age or ambition”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHead coach Wiegman believes that the team’s performances are “making a difference” and that the “whole country is proud” of the progress. “Even more girls and boys will want to play football.”\n\nEnd the ‘eyebrow-raising disparities’\n\nWatching the semi-final from the gantry at Bramall Lane, BBC pundit Ian Wright said he felt “as proud as I’ve ever felt of any England side”. However, the former Arsenal and England striker did send a warning to the authorities who run the game. “Whatever happens in the final now, if girls are not allowed to play football in their PE, just like the boys can, what are we doing?” he said. “We have got to make sure they are able to play and get the opportunity to do so. If there’s no legacy to this – like with the Olympics – then what are we doing.”\n\nThis year’s European Championship has “caught the imagination of football fans and the wider public” and the women’s game is “undoubtedly, having a moment”, said Marie-Christine Bouchier, the Professional Footballers’ Association’s director of women’s football, writing in The Guardian. England’s performances have led the newspaper back pages and “even more of the players are becoming household names”.\n\nThe real legacy, however, “must be true parity” for female footballers in England, Bouchier added. In April the government endorsed ten key strategic recommendations set out in a fan-led review of football in England. Published in November 2021 by former sports minister Tracey Crouch, a number of “detailed recommendations” were made, including that women’s football “should be treated with parity and given its own dedicated review”.\n\n“Now is the perfect time” to launch the promised review and “end eyebrow-raising disparities”, Bouchier said. “It’s an opportunity that we need to make sure we don’t miss.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957522/sarina-wiegman-england-one-of-a-kind-supercoach", "title": "Profile: who is Sarina Wiegman?

Gatecrashed by some very happy Lionesses, this was “just your standard Sarina Wiegman press conference”, said Sky Sports.\n\nAs Wiegman “attempted to dissect the win to the press”, she was “suddenly ambushed” by the England players, who proceeded to launch into a rendition of Football’s Coming Home, said Olly Roberts on GiveMeSport. There was “absolute mayhem”, as Lucy Bronze and Mary Earps danced on the table and the rest of the Lionesses “paraded around the room”.\n\nThe joyous scenes on the pitch, in the dressing room and in the press conference proved how big a moment this was for women’s football in the country.

Now unbeaten in 20 games since taking charge last September, she has “moulded England into an impressively ruthless outfit”.\n\nAfter winning the Euros with her native Netherlands in 2017, the 52-year-old has become the first coach to win consecutive championship titles with two different countries, said Jamie Spencer on 90min.com. She boasts a “perfect record” of 12 wins from 12 games at the Euros – six with the Netherlands in 2017 and now six with England this summer. Her time with the Lionesses has been “nothing short of incredible”. She has quickly put her stamp on an “already talented squad that had started to underachieve in the years since 2019”.\n\nShe may be a “tough taskmaster”, whose “eyes can spit fire”, but the “laser-focused” coach gets results with her “bold” changes to the team during a match, said Adam Shergold in the Daily Mail. Never afraid of “making big calls”, the “character” and fighting spirit instilled in the team by Wiegman has come “to the fore”.\n\nEngland are unbeaten in the 20 games Wiegman has been in charge (Image credit: Lynne Cameron/The FA via Getty Images)\n\nA ‘bumper’ new contract?\n\nThe “mastermind” behind England’s success, Wiegman will be in “high demand” ahead of next year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup, said Jeremy Cross in the Daily Star. Wary that she could be “lured away” at some stage, the English Football Association is expected to open contract talks “in a bid to secure her long-term future”. Wiegman will “pocket a £200,000 bonus” for winning Euro 2022, said Ben Willcocks in the Daily Mail. Despite having two years left on her current £400,000-a-year deal, she is also “in line for a bumper new contract”.\n\nEngland defender Rachel Daly believes Wiegman should be recognised as one of Europe’s best coaches – in women’s or men’s football. “She’s incredible,” the full-back said. “She’ll never take any credit but you can see how she influences us. She’s a calming presence on the bench, on the sidelines, in the changing rooms, in training. She’s one of a kind and we’re so lucky to have her.”\n\nThere’s no doubting Wiegman’s impact on the women’s team in England. But for the supercoach herself, she believes the performances of her players will contribute much wider than just sport. “This tournament has done so much for the game but also for women in society,” she said. “I don’t think we’ve really realised what we’ve done. Over the whole tournament we’ve had so much support from our fans. We did an incredible job and I’m so proud of my team.” At the end of her press conference, Wiegman had the final say with three words: “We changed society.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957489/where-to-watch-england-vs-germany-womens-euro-final-screenings", "title": "Where to watch the final - Uefa Women's Euro 2022 guide: the ...", "text": "England’s Women’s Euro 2022 semi-final win over Sweden on Tuesday was watched by an average TV audience of 7.9m, according to the BBC.

To put the country’s dominance in this competition into context, of the 12 editions of the Women’s Euros that have been contested, Germany has won eight of them.\n\nThis iteration of the national team is desperate to take its country back to the pinnacle of European international football and has recorded a couple of impressive results at Euro 2022 thanks largely to its stingy defense, which was yet to concede a goal at the tournament.\n\nConversely, France has very little Euros experience. Wednesday’s match marked the first time it had reached the semifinals of a European Championship and the team had endured a bumpy road to get there.\n\nKadidiatou Diani's deflected shot saw France level against Germany. Harriet Lander/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nFirst, there was significant surprise when it was announced that stalwart midfielder Amandine Henry had been left out of the squad for this tournament, which sparked reports of discontent within the French camp, before star striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto suffered an ACL injury in the group stages.\n\nBut to France’s credit, there were no early signs that this team was to be overawed by the occasion or its opponent.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes were a tense affair as both teams began the game by just feeling each other out. Neither side seemed willing to commit enough bodies forward to truly trouble the other, but France began showing flashes of the danger it possesses on the counterattack.\n\nWingers Delphine Cascarino and Kadidiatou Diani in particular were posing a threat to Germany’s so far unbeatable back line.\n\nHowever, it was Germany that mustered the first meaningful effort of the game as Alexandra Popp’s wicked free-kick was brilliantly tipped around the post by goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin.\n\nIt was a testament to the quality of the save that a number of German fans inside the stadium had already begun to rise out of their seats in celebration, only to be left disappointed by Peyraud-Magnin’s fingertips.\n\nThe sizable group of French fans in the corner to the right of Peyraud-Magnin’s goal had the perfect view of their goalkeeper’s heroics and cheered with approval, before leading a large portion of the stadium in chants of “Allez Les Bleus.”\n\nBut with the game meandering towards half-time, a moment of quality five minutes before the whistle broke the deadlock seemingly from nothing.\n\nSvenja Huth’s cross into the box was met by Popp, whose instinctive dash into the six-yard box allowed her to beat French defender Eve Perisset to the ball and stab it into the roof of the net.\n\nGermany's players celebrate Popp's opening goal of the match. FRANCK FIFE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrance responds\n\nIt was certainly a goal this game needed and it was one that sparked the contest to life.\n\nAfter waiting 40 minutes for the first goal to come, the 27,445 inside Stadium MK only had to wait five minutes for the second.\n\nDiani thought she had scored the goal that her early efforts merited, but replays showed her long-range effort hit the post and bounced into the goal off German goalkeeper Frohms, who was credited with an unfortunate own goal.\n\nThat certainly helped France feel like it belonged on this stage and the team emerged from the half-time break with a new-found intensity.\n\nJust after the hour mark, substitute Selma Bacha had a wonderful chance to put her side ahead, controlling the ball and swiveling smartly in the box, but she was denied by a brilliant block from defender Kathrin-Julia Hendrich.\n\nFrom the resulting corner, the towering Wendy Renard got up at the far post but her header was smothered away on the line.\n\nThe chances were now coming thick and fast for France as a frustrated German side began to make mistakes. Bacha was again denied from a narrow angle, this time by the legs of goalkeeper Frohms.\n\nThe French fans sensed an upset was on the cards and the chants of “Allez Les Bleus” now reververbated louder than ever around the ground.\n\nBut, even with its back up against the wall, Germany is a relentless force to be reckoned with at the Euros.\n\nGerman players celebrate after the final whistle. Harriet Lander/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nNo team in any European competition can come close to matching Germany’s record in this tournament and years of dominance have given this national team a remarkable self-belief.\n\nWhen all the signs were pointing to a France win, Popp appeared once again on the end of a Huth cross to give Germany the lead, this time powering a header past Peyraud-Magnin.\n\nAs Popp pumped her fists in front of a delirious section of Germany fans, the French players looked shell-shocked and despondent, heads bowed as they made their way back to the center circle.\n\nThere were still more chances to come for both teams, but a German victory now felt inevitable.\n\nWhen the full-time whistle went, many of Germany’s players collapsed to the floor, exhausted from the physical and emotional exertion it took to dispatch a France team that will no doubt be a major force on the international stage for a while to come.\n\nOne more grueling test awaits for Germany against England on Sunday – perhaps its most difficult yet – but the eight-time champion will be in no doubt it can make that nine.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/football/gareth-southgate-england-world-cup-qatar-2022", "title": "World Cup 2022: Workers in Gulf state are united in wanting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has a lot on his plate as the World Cup in Qatar grows ever closer. He is trying to turn around an England football team enduring its worst run of form since 1992, while facing an ever-growing injury list. All this as he prepares for the first World Cup held mid-season.\n\nMoreover, this is a World Cup – starting on November 20 – which has been dogged by a number of human rights issues.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 migrant workers had died in the country in the 10 years following Qatar’s successful bid to host the tournament in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report – “categorically” denied by tournament organizers – did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nQatar has also been the subject of criticism for the country’s anti-LGBTQ laws.\n\nSouthgate is entering his third major tournament having taken England to at least the semi-finals in the previous two. Antonio Calanni/AP\n\nNonetheless, Southgate believes the World Cup should go ahead and says that view is shared by the workers in Qatar that he has spoken with.\n\n“I’ve been out to Qatar several times and I’ve met with lots of the workers out there and they are united in certainly one thing that’s that they want the tournament to happen, and they want that because they love football. They want the football to come to Qatar,” Southgate told CNN’s Amanda Davies.\n\nHowever, the England manager is unlikely to be remaining silent about the human rights issues that have dogged Qatar ahead of the World Cup.\n\n“As an FA we’ve talked to human rights groups about what they would like to see, and we’re trying to support those ideas with compensation for families who have lost workers and a worker’s rights center,” said Southgate. “So, we’re supporting the things we’ve been asked to support.”\n\nIn June, England’s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark’s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe three captains’ national sides, along with five other nations will all be participating in the “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination and will be wearing a distinctive OneLove armband which features a heart containing colors from all backgrounds – during the tournament.\n\nThe Qatari government has bristled at the criticism the Gulf state has faced.\n\nQatar is bracing itself to host the World Cup as the smallest ever nation. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani recently told Qatar’s legislative Shura Council that his country has, “been subjected to an unprecedented campaign that no host country has ever faced.”\n\n“We initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered some of the criticism as positive and useful in helping us to develop aspects of ours that need to be developed.\n\n“But it soon became clear to us that the campaign tends to continue and expand to include fabrications and double standards that were so ferocious that it has unfortunately prompted many people to question the real reasons and motives behind this campaign,” he said.\n\nIf the legacy of the World Cup in Qatar – for now – remains unclear, Southgate says, “In years to come I know I’ll look back and think what a life experience and what an amazing thing to have lived through.\n\n“I mean, in the end, the football is everything. It’s why we we’re there. It’s what we’re there to do.”\n\nOn England’s chances of winning the World Cup, Southgate said: “There are some complications with how regular some of our important players are playing. There’s going to be injuries ahead of the tournament and how badly is that going to affect us? It’s pointless looking further ahead, but of course ultimately there’s no point us going if we’re not trying to win it.”\n\nBeing manager of the England team has often been referred to as the “impossible job,” but Southgate has done a pretty good job in the role, reaching the World Cup semifinal in 2018 and then the Euro 2020 final.\n\n“There’s more expectation than when we went to Russia,” said Southgate referring to the 2018 World Cup.\n\n“But whenever you put an England shirt on, there’s always pressure. The incredible highs that you get of leading your country to those great nights are always going to be balanced with difficult times and discomfort, and you’ve got to lead through that.”\n\n“You’ve got to get your best players on the field in a manner that gets the best out of them. And then, of course, you have to deliver in the tournament. That’s where you’ll always be judged as an international manager.”\n\nOn their chances of winning the World Cup, Southgate adds: “There are some complications with how regular some of our important players are playing. There’s going to be injuries ahead of the tournament and how badly is that going to affect us? It’s pointless looking further ahead, but of course ultimately there’s no point us going if we’re not trying to win it.”", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth Amanda Davies", "Alasdair Howorth", "Amanda Davies"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/football/womens-euro-2022-final-england-germany-spt-intl", "title": "Women's Euro 2022: England out to avenge 2009 final defeat in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEngland against Germany, a clash between two of the best national teams in the world, will be a fitting finale to what has been a record-breaking tournament at Euro 2022.\n\nAfter the two semifinal matches, a total of 487,683 fans have attended the games so far, more than doubling the previous record of 240,055, set at Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.\n\nThat’s without taking into consideration the historic attendance expected at Wembley Stadium for Sunday’s final. Around 87,000 fans are set to be at the home of English football, which would smash the current attendance record for a Euros final – men’s or women’s – of 79,115, set at the 1964 final between Spain and the Soviet Union at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nUEFA, European football’s governing body, says nearly 100,000 children have attended matches so far at Euro 2022, while 47% of all fans have been women.\n\nOf course, it certainly helps that home fans have been fortunate enough to watch arguably the most talented England women’s side of all time.\n\nThe 8-0 dismantling of a dangerous Norway side, ranked just two places below England, and the 4-0 drubbing of Sweden, the second-best team in the world and a team England had previously beaten just three times, will go down as some of the most eye-catching in the Lionesses’ history.\n\nBut the path to the final wasn’t always a straightforward one. England struggled to find its rhythm in a tough opening win against Austria, before being pushed all the way in a comeback win over Spain in the quarterfinals.\n\nREAD: ‘That was lit’ – Stunning Alessia Russo back-heel goal has fans gushing as England advances to Euro 2022 final\n\nChloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp celebrate following the 8-0 win over Norway. Harriet Lander/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nEngland, though, will certainly be glad it has been put to the test ahead of its most difficult match yet. Germany boasts a quite extraordinary record in the European Championship, winning eight of the 12 editions that have been contested and reigned over the Euros crown for 22 years until defeat at the quarterfinal stage in the Netherlands five years ago.\n\nHead coach Sarina Wiegman, who guided her native Netherlands to victory at Euro 2017, is well aware of how important an England win on Sunday could be for women’s football in the country.\n\n“I think we have been an inspiration for the country already,” she told reporters on Friday, per Reuters. “You know when you win a major tournament it really makes a difference and that would make me very proud. But I don’t think further than that. Most of the time you don’t realise the impact until probably 15 years later.\n\n“We approach this game exactly the same as every other game we have played. We don’t talk about the rivalry between England and Germany; we want to show how good we are and play our best game.\n\n“There’s so much eagerness in this team to win, and so much resilience. We want so badly to show again we are the best and to play our best game. That’s what we’ve been trying to do all the time and then hopefully, that will bring us to win.”\n\n‘Nothing left to lose’\n\nAlexandra Popp, who has become Germany’s star with six goals in five games at these Euros, is one of the best feel-good stories of the summer.\n\nThe 31-year-old missed the Euros in 2013 and 2017 through injury and, for a while, it looked as though she might miss this one after injuring her knee last year, but Popp was finally able to compete when the tournament was postponed by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShe has certainly made up for lost time and was visibly emotional after scoring in the opening win against Denmark, sinking to her knees and covering her face with her hands.\n\nAlexandra Popp's six goals at Euro 2022 equals the all-time record at a single tournament. Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nPopp’s six goals at Euro 2022, matched only by England’s Beth Mead, equals the previous best goal haul at a single Euros, set by compatriot Inka Grings at Finland 2009.\n\n“I think the pressure is more on the English side, precisely because it takes place in their own country,” Popp told reporters at a press conference on Friday. “We know that from 2011 [when Germany hosted the World Cup], suddenly everyone expects something from you.\n\n“We have nothing left to lose. With that attitude we can go into the game completely free.”\n\nThere certainly seem to be no nerves in the German camp ahead of the final, with Popp turning up to the press conference wearing a mustache hidden under her mask. “Hello,” she said, greeting reporters in a gruff voice.\n\nAfter her match-winning performance against France in the semifinals, German outlets FUMS and Der Postillon ran satirical posts saying that men’s national team head coach Hansi Flick had called up a new striker for Qatar, accompanied by a photo of Popp in a mustache with the pseudonyms Alexander Bopp and Alexander Papp.\n\nThe forward will no doubt be the biggest threat England faces on the Wembley pitch come Sunday and it’s likely a moment of instinct from Popp or Mead could decide the game.\n\nThese two teams boast a brilliant defensive record at this tournament, having each conceded just one goal, and it’s likely their stingy back lines will be difficult to breach in the final.\n\nAlexandra Popp wore a fake mustache to her pre-match press conference on Friday. Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\n‘Outstanding’\n\nThe quality on display at Euro 2022 only emphasizes the accelerated growth of the women’s game across the continent in recent years, as football federations have finally started to seriously invest in their teams.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who says he has been closely following Germany’s progress, said women’s football as “exploded” in recent years.\n\n“I really have to say I love women’s football, it’s outstanding,” Klopp said at a press conference on Thursday.\n\n“The quality of the tournament is insane. England is doing exceptionally well. I saw three games of Germany, they’ve been doing really well as well. It’s a really good final – two intense teams facing each other.\n\n“As much as I love England, in this specific case my heart is on the German side, but the better team might win and I’m completely fine with that. At a sold out Wembley with an English crowd, it will be a massive challenge for Germany.\n\n“Most important is the face women’s football showed, it’s a fantastic game. Women’s football, over the last few years, exploded in their development. It’s tactically and technically on an incredibly high level. The intensity of the games – physically it’s really, really good and I love watching it.\n\n“England are slight favorites playing at home, but Germany has a chance.”\n\nAfter defeat in the men’s Euros final last summer, England fans will be desperate to avoid double heartbreak.

It is presented annually by France Football since 1956.\n\nThe three main criteria for the prestigious award are based on individual performances and impressive character, team performances and achievements, and class and fair play.\n\nThe winner of the 2024 Ballon d'Or was Rodri of Manchester City.

And it was just a joyful feeling. I’m going to cherish that for a very long time.”\n\nFive years ago, Hegerberg – then aged 21 – stepped away from the national team after her experiences with the side left her “mentally broken” and frustrated with the way women’s football was regarded in Norway.\n\n“I can clearly say that I never hope it happens to another player again, that you should be put in a position where you need to make a choice like that,” she says following her return to the side.\n\n“But at the moment, I would never forget it.

She holds the record for the most goals scored in the Champions League with 56 and was awarded the first-ever Ballon d’Or Feminin in 2018.\n\nAs well as these individual accolades, Hegerberg achieved great success with Lyon, guiding the club to five consecutive Champions League titles – a record for a team of any gender. On Saturday in Turin, Lyon face Barcelona in this season’s Champions League final.\n\n‘A new chapter’\n\nDespite these accomplishments, Hegerberg remained outside the international arena, steadfastly maintaining her stance against the Norwegian Football Federation (NFF).\n\nThe 2019 Women’s World Cup did not tempt her back into the national setup, and Hegerberg says it was only the recent election of Lise Klaveness as president of the NFF – the first woman to hold that position – that convinced her to return.\n\nThe pair played together when Hegerberg was at the start of her career, and she says discussions with Klaveness were central to her return to the national team. They connected over their shared difficulties with the federation, and the challenges facing women’s football.\n\n“I felt like I was growing a lot during those talks, but I felt that it was the right time to go back and play for my country again,” Hegerberg says.\n\n“I really believe that Lise can be a very important figure and position to kind of shake up things still so that young girls can be taken better care of for the future. I would absolutely back her all the way in order to drive women’s football into the right direction. So it feels very good.”\n\nLise Klaveness hit the headlines in March when she condemned the decision to allow Qatar to host the World Cup. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nSince Hegerberg stepped away from the national team, the NFF has changed its approach towards the women’s team.\n\nMen and women now receive the same financial compensation for representing Norway following an agreement that doubled the remuneration pot for women from 3.1 million Norwegian kroner ($330,739) to six million kroner ($640,150).\n\n“Obviously, you shouldn’t forget in order not to repeat the same history, but I feel like it’s a new chapter, that it’s ongoing and it’s very refreshing as well,” says Hegerberg.\n\n“And obviously it’s being back trying to build on something because you have very good players out in Europe now, Norwegian girls.\n\n“So I think now is the moment just to build stone by stone. And I am very much motivated as well to take a part of the responsibility to keep on pushing the football into the right direction in Norway.”\n\n‘Give the conditions that women players deserve’\n\nIt is not just in Norway where the conversations surrounding women’s football have changed in the intervening years between Hegerberg’s last two international appearances.\n\nLast month, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced that footballers playing in Italy’s top women’s league – Serie A – would be classed as professional athletes, ending years of capped salaries due to their amateur status.\n\n“I feel like we’re slowly starting to gain momentum again to get back in that good rhythm that we had before Covid struck us and are building more professionally,” Hegerberg says.\n\n“Give the conditions that the women players deserve and broadly get a more professional daily life so that we can become even better and show even better football long term. It’s all about pushing us players – we’ve just got to perform really.”\n\nFemale players are increasingly performing on the biggest of stages. Camp Nou – Barcelona’s stadium – sold out twice in recent months, setting consecutive records for the highest attendance at a women’s football match.\n\nIn March, 91,553 fans watched Barça defeat Real Madrid in a UEFA Champions League quarterfinal and, less than a month later, 91,648 cheered their home team to a 5-1 victory over Wolfsburg in the semifinal.\n\n“It’s brilliant,” Hegerberg says. “It’s what you want to achieve in the game and seeing those sellouts, full-packed Camp Nou – it’s amazing, really.\n\n“That’s what we try to achieve, every women’s club. We’ve seen some good trends. And now the big challenge is to get those people back to the stadiums week in and week out and get that stability that we need.”\n\nHegerberg has won five Champions League titles with Lyon. Jon Olav Nesvold/Bildbryan/Reuters\n\n‘The best part of the season’\n\nLast season, without an injured Hegerberg, Lyon failed to reach the Champions League final for just the third time in 10 years, ending the club’s five-year reign as European champion. Barcelona took advantage of Lyon’s absence and is now seeking a first back-to-back title.\n\n“Obviously Barcelona is a very strong team,” Hegerberg said. “You can see that they have gotten time to develop their style of game together. They play a very strong possession orientated football as well.”\n\nHegerberg is playing knockout football for the first time in three years after she was sidelined for nearly two seasons with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in January 2020 and then a stress fracture to her left tibia.\n\n“I’m just trying to enjoy every day, every second with the ball and spring is here and the big games are coming up,” she says. “So it’s probably the best part of the season as well.”\n\nAfter the Champions League final, Hegerberg is looking forward to the 2022 UEFA European Women’s Championship – her first major tournament following her return to the Norwegian side.\n\n“It’s a tough tournament,” Hegerberg says. “It can go both ways. It’s all about preparing in a very calm but focused manner. And yeah, we’ll be ready for it all. But we know from the past that we’ve experienced a final back in 2013 and then we experienced the very tough Euros in 2017.”\n\nNorway lost all three of its group matches in 2017, a disappointing series of results for a team ranked fourth at the start of the tournament.\n\nThis time around, Norway’s campaign kicks off with a match against Northern Ireland on the July 7 as it seeks to advance to the knockout stages from a group that also contains Austria and England.\n\n“It’s all about learning from those experiences and being as prepared as possible,” Hegerberg says, “but also enjoying because those tournaments are a highlight of your career.”", "authors": ["Christina Macfarlane Issy Ronald", "Christina Macfarlane", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}]}

A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\" Harris told a cheering crowd at the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris spent much of 2024 campaigning as President Joe Biden's running mate. But on Thursday, she talked to the party that swiftly rallied around her after he ended his reelection bid. She laid out how she would address the major debates facing the nation, ranging from abortion rights to the southern border and the economy.\n\nThe vice president's speech comes after her own running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, delivered his acceptance address on Wednesday, telling his fellow party members \"Thank you for bringing the joy to this fight.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the Democratic convention in Chicago.\n\nHarris pledges to ‘stand strong’ with Ukraine, work to end war in Gaza\n\nHarris pledged to “stand strong” with Ukraine and NATO and said she is working “around the clock” to end the war in Gaza.\n\n“Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia’s plan to invade,” she said. “I helped mobilize a global response, over 50 countries, to defend against Putin’s aggression. And as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”\n\nOn the war in Gaza, Harris said “now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.”\n\n“Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” she said. “Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7.”\n\nShe also said “what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating.”\n\n“The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages is released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nReproductive rights get center-stage moment in Harris’ speech\n\nBashing her opponent and the GOP’s record, Harris highlighted reproductive rights as a key issue in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n“Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said of Trump and Republicans. “And one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women?”\n\n“Well, we trust women,” she continued, adding that as president she would “proudly sign” legislation to enshrine abortion access.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been the leading voice in the current Biden administration on reproductive rights and abortion access – a winning issue for many Democrats since 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris vows to bring back bipartisan border deal Trump bashed\n\nHarris said that after decades in law enforcement, she knows the “importance of safety and security, especially at our border.”\n\n“Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades,” she said. The bill was killed by Senate Republicans in February after pressure from Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,” she alleged. “Well I refuse to play politics with our security. And here is my pledge to you as President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'New path forward'\n\nHarris told convention attendees that her campaign is all about charting a “new path forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class.”\n\n“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success, and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said.\n\nHarris said that, if elected, she would pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. She said her term would also also allow Americans to “fully make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” she said, referring to reproductive rights and other matters.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump hits Harris and her speech\n\nNot exactly breaking news: Donald Trump gave bad reviews to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.\n\nIn a constant stream of Truth Social posts, Trump assailed the vice president's remarks on items ranging from the condition of her former home city of San Francisco to inflation, immigration and relations with other countries.\n\nAfter Harris accused him of wanting to be an autocrat, Trump concluded by saying: \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she’s weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\"\n\nAt another point, Trump pointed out that Harris and President Joe Biden have ignored the issues that came up in the speech: \"No specific programs, ALL TALK, NO ACTION - Why didn’t she do it three and a half years ago.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris zeroes in on Trump in convention address\n\nKamala Harris called out former President Donald Trump by name in her acceptance speech, saying the former president is “in many ways ... an unserious man.”\n\n“But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,” Harris said.\n\nPointing to what she called the “chaos and calamity” of his first term, Harris raised alarms about her 2024 opponent.\n\n“Consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for.\"\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nHarris accepts presidential nomination\n\nKamala Harris formally accepted her party’s presidential nomination, as the Democratic convention comes to a close Thursday.\n\n“On behalf of every American regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey ... I accept your nomination,” Harris told the crowd.\n\nDemocrats had officially nominated Harris in a virtual vote earlier this month and affirmed the decision at the convention Tuesday in an enthusiastic celebratory roll call.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris calls Biden’s character ‘inspiring’\n\nHarris began her remarks thanking President Joe Biden, who ended his reelection bid and immediately endorsed her candidacy.\n\n“To our President Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” Harris said.\n\n“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring, and Doug and I love you and Jill, and are forever thankful to you both,” she added.\n\nShe said that the path to get to the nomination was “no doubt unexpected but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIlhan Omar: “Mistake” not to platform Palestinian voice\n\nOn Thursday evening, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. She has not explained if or how her approach to the conflict would differ from Biden’s.\n\n—Laura Gersony\n\nRoy Cooper calls Kamala Harris ‘one hell of a fighter’\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper acknowledged he’s not the main event of the night.\n\n“Hello, America,” he said. “I’m Roy Cooper, the last guy standing between you and the moment we’re all waiting for.”\n\nCooper, a former North Carolina attorney general, told the audience how he worked with Harris when she was California’s attorney general, when she insisted on holding out for a bigger settlement from the nation’s big banks after the 2008 housing crash.\n\n“She went toe to toe with some of the world’s most powerful executives, and she refused to give in,” he said. “Let me tell you, this was a huge risk, but she knew it was a risk worth taking. That’s Kamala. And we all know what happened. The banks caved.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ sister, Maya Harris, pays tribute to their mother\n\nMaya Harris, Kamala Harris’ younger sister, opened her remarks by reflecting on her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.\n\n“Mommy was so many things to so many people, a civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her two little girls,” said Maya Harris. “But most of all, Mommy was a trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself. And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote. Do not report rumors. FOCUS.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report that according to a representative for the singer, \"Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there.”\n\nLeading up to the DNC, fans speculated the megastar might perform. Of course, Walz has been deemed a certified Beyhive member. And Beyoncé's camp gave Harris approval to use her song \"Freedom\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on her campaign trail. The song has become an anthem for Harris' campaign.\n\n− Liz Schubauer\n\nAnother Republican for Harris addresses Democratic audience\n\nSaying he was “proud to be in the trenches” with the evening’s crowd, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021. He was one of two Republicans to serve on the House committee investigating the insurrection at the Capitol. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” Kinzinger asked.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nEva Longoria calls on Democrats to say ‘she se puede’\n\nActress Eva Longoria put a new twist on a popular chant as she urged the crowd to root for Harris’ success. Longoria told the crowd to take the Spanish phrase, “Si se puede,” meaning, “yes we can,” and turn it into “she se puede.”\n\nWhen somebody asks, ‘Is she going to be the first female president of the United States?’ we’re going to say, ‘She se puede,’” Longoria said.\n\n“We know how to work so let’s get to work,” she said. “Let’s turn all of this enthusiasm and joy into action between now and November 5th. Let’s go!”\n\nShe walked offstage to chants of “she se puede!”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nGretchen Whitmer takes the stage at the convention\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer made a point to share her nickname with convention attendees at the beginning of her remarks.\n\n“In Lansing, they call me governor, but in Detroit, they call me Big Gretch,” she said, adding that women across America GST- “Get Stuff Done.”\n\n“At 29 I joined the sandwich generation sandwiched between working and raising my newborn and caring for my mom, who was dying from brain cancer. It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store? That's what the chauffeur is for,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRuben Gallego leads Democratic veterans onstage, tells Trump to ‘show some respect’\n\nArizona Senate nominee Ruben Gallego led a group of Democratic veterans, including members of the U.S. House and Senate, onstage, urging Donald Trump to “show some respect” to veterans.\n\n“We were proud to wear the uniform,” said Gallego, a congressman who served in the Marines. “And we’re proud serving our countries in city halls, state capitols, the U.S. House and the Senate. These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\n“John McCain was an American hero,” Gallego said. “Show some respect.”\n\n“Trump’s Project 2025 would slash veteran benefits and force VA hospitals to close across the nation,” he said. “Show some respect.”\n\n--Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMark Kelly says Trump ‘dreaming’ of becoming a dictator\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said Harris will stand with America’s allies and is “the leader we need right now.” Harris, he said, understands the importance of international alliances like NATO, and of supporting Ukraine in its war defending itself from Russia’s invasion.\n\n“Donald Trump skipped his intelligence briefings,” Kelly said. “He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself.”\n\nKelly referred to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that said Trump described fallen service members were “suckers” and “losers.” Trump denies the report.\n\n“Trump thinks that Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are suckers and losers,” Kelly said. “If we fall for that again and make him the commander in chief, the only suckers would be us.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miler\n\nDenied a speaker, pro-Palestinian Democratic delegates make new demand on Kamala Harris\n\nStymied in their demand that a Palestinian-American be allowed to speak to the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, a group of uncommitted delegates ended a protest outside the United Center on Thursday with a new demand: that Vice President Kamala Harris meet Arab-American and Muslims in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThey also set a deadline for such a meeting or meetings to take place of Sept. 15.\n\nWhile not saying what they would or would not do if a meeting did not take place to discuss their insistence that the U.S. stop shipping weapons to Israel and demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the organizers suggested there would be ramifications. Those could potentially involve holding back in terms of organizing on Harris' behalf in the fall campaign or arguing her case to voters.\n\n−Todd Spangler, Karissa Waddick and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nGroup shares harrowing stories about gun violence\n\nA group took to the stage at the convention Thursday night to retell somber stories about the loss of their loved ones from gun violence. One of the stories was from Abbey Clements, a former second grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Twenty-six people were killed at the school in a mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nKim Rubio recalled when her daughter Lexi walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, for the last time.\n\n“It’s 10:30am at Robb Elementary in Uvalde,” Rubio said. “The school is recognizing my 10 year old daughter, Lexi, for receiving all A's. She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved. I'll keep calling and I'll keep fighting,” McFadden said. Edgar Vilchez, whose friend was killed in a shooting at their high school, said that moment changed him. “Instead about worrying about taking a test, I started worrying about living to take another test,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nShooting survivor and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords takes the stage\n\nPart of a series of speakers to address gun violence, mass shooting survivor and former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona appeared Thursday to recount her experience.\n\n“Terrible, terrible day. I almost died,” Giffords said of an assassination attempt in 2011 that killed six and left the congresswoman severely injured.\n\n“But I fought for my life, and I survived,” she continued.\n\nGiffords was joined on stage by her husband, Sen. Mark Kelly. She began her speech by telling the crowd she was “born with grit.” And, she said, Harris too “has grit.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is singing with P!nk?\n\nThe singer P!nk performed her hit some \"What About Us\" at the Democratic convention, taking the stage with her daughter, Willow.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden says he spoke to Kamala Harris ahead of her acceptance speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, just got off the phone with Kamala Harris ahead of her acceptance speech. He shared a picture of the first couple standing in front of a television showing the convention, a phone in his hand.\n\n“Jill and I just spoke to @KamalaHarris — we can’t wait to watch her accept this historic nomination,” Biden wrote in the post.\n\n“Kamala and Tim will inspire a generation and lead us into the future,” he wrote, referring to vice presidential nominee Tim Walz.\n\nThe Bidens spoke Monday on the convention’s first night, before ceding the spotlight to Harris and Walz.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ loved ones, Meena Harris, Ella Emhoff and Helena Hudlin, speak out in support\n\nA trio of Kamala Harris' loved ones paid tribute to the vice president on Thursday.\n\nMeena Harris, niece of Kamala Harris, said that her aunt “showed me the meaning of service, helping her sister, a 17 year old single mom, fighting for justice for the American people, and still cooking Sunday family dinner.”\n\n“She guided me. Now she's guiding my own children, and I know she'll guide our country forward,” said Meena Harris.\n\nElla Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, said that the vice president came into her life when she was 14 - “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked.\n\n“Like a lot of young people, I didn't always understand what I was feeling. But no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring, and always took me seriously. She's never stopped listening to me, and she's not going to stop listening to all of us,” Emhoff said.\n\nHelena Hudlin, goddaughter of Harris, said that Kamala Harris’ advice “means everything, whether it's pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn't feel so hopeful.”\n\n“She taught me that making a difference means giving your whole heart and taking action,” Hudlin said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKerry Washington brings 'Scandal' costar Tony Goldwyn, Harris family members on stage with her\n\nActress Kerry Washington helped host the final hours of the Democratic convention’s final night.\n\nShe brought back to the stage her former “Scandal” costar Tony Goldwyn, who days earlier also made a convention stage appearance. And in a moment that appeared to be targeted at Republicans’ mispronouncing of Harris’ first name at the GOP convention last month, Washington was joined by the vice president’s young grandnieces, Amara and Leela.\n\n\"Confusion is understandable. Disrespect is not,” Washington said. “So tonight, we are going to help everyone get it right.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nThe Chicks perform the National Anthem\n\nThe Chicks, the award-winning country band, performed an a cappella version of “The Star Spangled Banner” to a packed convention hall.\n\nMembers Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer stood onstage at a single mic as they sang the anthem.\n\nAfter they finished, the crowd began chanting “USA. USA.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nTexas Senate candidate Colin Allred calls Donald Trump, Ted Cruz ‘me guys’\n\nTexas Senate nominee Colin Allred called former President Donald Trump and his own Republican opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ‘me guys’ who are out for themselves. Allred, a member of Congress from Dallas and a former NFL player and civil rights lawyer, introduced himself to the crowd as “the guy who’s going to turn Texas’ Senate seat blue.”\n\nHe said in the NFL, the term they’d use to describe Trump and Cruz is “me guys.”\n\n“You know the type. Talk a big game, only care about themselves,” he said. “But you don’t want to be stuck with them at a barbeque.”\n\n“We’ve got a message for the ‘me guys,’” he said. “‘We’ is more powerful than ‘me.’ We will protect and restore reproductive freedom. We will secure the border. We’ll protect Medicare and Social Security. And we’ll turn the page and write a new chapter for this country: Elect Kamala Harris to be the next president and beat Ted Cruz.”\n\nAs Allred walked offstage, the crowd chanted “beat Ted Cruz.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nConvention broadcasts video of Steph Curry\n\nThe convention featured a pre-recorded video of famed basketball player Stephen Curry, who just won gold in the 2024 Olympics. Curry began his remarks saying that unity on and off the basketball court “reminded us all that together, we can do all things and continue to inspire the world.”\n\n“That's why I believe that Kamala as president could bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward. This is about preserving hope and belief in our country, making sure families can be taken care of during the most precious times,” he said.\n\nCurry noted that he visited Harris with his team at the White House last year, and said he can tell attendees something he knew then that he definitely knows now: “the Oval Office suits her well.”\n\n“So, in the words of Michelle Obama: do something! Go vote! Be active!” he said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMaxwell Frost calls on voters to back Kamala Harris 'for our planet'\n\nRep. Maxwell Frost of Florida, the first Gen Z member of Congress, called on Americans to vote for Harris “for our planet.”\n\n“The climate crisis isn’t some far off threat,” Frost said. “It is here.”\n\nA former organizer for the student-led gun control advocacy group March for Our Lives, Frost said the Biden-Harris administration has already been making progress addressing climate change.\n\n“This election is about every drop of water that we consume and every breath we breathe,” he told the crowd. “Fighting the climate crisis is patriotic.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nDeb Haaland says Kamala Harris will fight for ‘clean air, clean water and healthy communities’\n\nSecretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said Harris will tackle climate change, pointing to her record as California attorney general and vice president.\n\n“An American president must lead the world in tackling climate change,” Haaland said. “We need a president who understands that assignment. That’s Kamala Harris.”\n\nShe praised Harris’ record holding polluters accountable for oil spills, defending former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan in court and casting the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a range of climate provisions.\n\n“Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will fight for a future where we all have clean air, clean water and healthy communities,” Haaland said.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nAntron McCray, Central Park Five speak out against Trump: ‘45 wanted us unalive’\n\nThe Central Park Five, a group of Black and Latino men who were wrongly accused of assaulting a white female jogger in 1989, bashed Trump on stage. The former president had bought out full-page advertisements calling for the death penalty after the attack\n\n“35 years ago, my friends and I were in prison for a crime we did not commit. Our youth was stolen from us. Every day as we walked into courtroom, people screamed at us, threatened us because of Donald Trump,” said Korey Wise, one of the members of the group.\n\nYusef Salaam, now a member of the New York City Council, said that “45 wanted us unalive.’\n\n“That man thinks that hate is the animating force in America. It is not. We have the constitutional right to vote. In fact, it is a human right, so let us use it. I want you to walk with us. I want you to march with us.

Al Sharpton told the DNC crowd, “Tonight, we are going to realize Shirley Chisholm’s dream” when Harris accepts the nomination.\n\nChisholm was the first Black woman elected to Congress. In 1972 she became the first Black candidate to run for a major party’s nomination and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party’s nomination.\n\n“Fifty-two years ago I was one of the youth directors in her campaign for president,” Sharpton said of Chisholm. “And 52 years after she was told to sit down, I know she’s watching us tonight as a Black woman stands up to accept the nomination for president of the United States.”\n\nHe contrasted Harris’ record with Trump’s on voting rights, civil rights and more, as the crowd chanted “won’t go back.”\n\n“I see one candidate who wants to protect the right to vote while the other has tried to cook up 11,000 votes in Georgia,” Sharpton said. “I see a candidate who, with Joe Biden, brought leaders to the White House to confront violent hatred, running against a man who said neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were fine people. I see a candidate who has sought to reform and uphold the law and a man who wrongly assumes his mug shot appeals to Black Americans.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMitt Romney says he's not tonight's surprise guest: 'So disappointing, I know!'\n\nMitt Romney will not be joining Democrats in Chicago.\n\n\"Contrary to fake news posts, I am not the surprise guest at the DNC tonight,\" Romney wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nRomney's was one of several names floated as a possible \"surprise guest\" appearing on the final night of the Democratic convention.

He admires dictators. A lot. He treats our friends as adversaries and our adversaries as friends.\n\nShe urged the audience to “claim your patriotism.”\n\n“For everyone here and everyone watching, I want you to proudly claim your patriotism,” she said. “You are here because you love your country.

Donald Trump announces 'special guest' at Friday event in Arizona\n\nThe Donald Trump campaign may be trying to build anticipation for a possible endorsement from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The campaign announced late Thursday that a \"special guest\" would join the former president at a Friday event in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nIn nearby Phoenix on Friday, Kennedy is scheduled to make an announcement about his independent campaign's future.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has said he would welcome Kennedy's support and possibly consider appointing him to some kind of position in a new administration.\n\n\"He's a little different kind of a guy, very smart guy, is a very good person,\" Trump said Thursday on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it.

Elizabeth Warren attacked former President Donald Trump’s criminal record in her speech to Democratic delegates, contrasting it with Harris’ experience as a prosecutor.\n\nWarren, who ran for the presidency in 2020, teared up as she was warmly greeted by the crowd Thursday night. She praised Harris’ work as California attorney general after the 2008 housing crash.\n\n“Kamala Harris stepped up,” Warren said. “She enforced the law, she fought the giant banks and she delivered billions of dollars of help for families. And that is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor.”\n\nWarren said Harris will work to make life more affordable for working families.\n\n“Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families,” Warren said. “He doesn’t know how. And basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers. But Kamala, she cares deep down. And she will take on the giant corporations that are squeezing American families.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMorgan Freeman lends iconic voice to Harris ad\n\nActor Morgan Freeman narrated a video advertisement for the Harris campaign released Thursday, hours before the vice president takes the stage to accept her party’s nomination.\n\n“She’s fighter for the American people,” Freeman began the 10-minute ad.\n\n“Committed to our values, our hopes, our dreams.

They're selling you a lie. It's in the bag with the diapers. Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.”\n\nHe added that “most companies are good companies. It's the food conglomerates that sit behind the supermarkets, the faceless wholesalers, they're the ones who are extorting families at the checkout counter.”\n\n“I've been fighting to ban price gouging on food, and next year, when she's president, Kamala Harris will sign a bill to do just that,” Casey said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris shares wedding anniversary date with eldest senator\n\nVice President Harris and husband Doug Emhoff celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary Thursday, on the final night of the Democratic convention.\n\nAlso celebrating today: Sen.

He said she’s also worked to expand Pell grants, increase funding for HBCUs.\n\n“And Kamala Harris made public service loan relief a reality for teachers and first responders and firefighters and nurses and countless others across our land,” he said.\n\n“Vice President Harris delivered before and she will do it again,” he continued. “As president, she will build a brighter future.

I never met my father, but I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me,” she said.\n\n“My grandparents were there for me, and as they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. So when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with a personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents,” she added.\n\nBaldwin accused former President Donald Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare “while giving a huge new tax break to billionaires and corporations.”\n\n“They've got it backwards.

Meet Kamala Harris' stepchildren − who call the VP 'Momala.'\n\nAs America’s first second gentleman, Doug Emhoff became the first person to bear the title when Vice President Kamala Harris was sworn into office in 2021.\n\nBut how did the two meet? Originally from Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Emhoff became an attorney in Los Angeles, focusing on entertainment and intellectual property law. In 2013, one of Emhoff’s clients – who also happened to be Harris’ best friend – set the pair up on a date.\n\nHarris and Emhoff were married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California where Harris’ sister, Maya, officiated. It was Harris’ first marriage and Emhoff’s second, and they share two adult children from his former marriage, Ella and Cole.\n\n− Victor Hagan\n\nGus Walz broke the internet with his tearful love for his dad. Then the bullying began\n\nAn emotional, unscripted moment between Tim Walz and his 17-year-old son, Gus, has unleased a flood of praise and admiration – but it also has prompted ugly online bullying.\n\nGus Walz, who has a nonverbal learning disorder as well as anxiety and ADHD, watched excitedly from the front row of Chicago’s United Center and sobbed openly Wednesday night as his father, the Democratic nominee for vice president, delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe Minnesota governor was recounting the difficult fertility treatment he and his wife, Gwen, went through to conceive their daughter, Hope.\n\nBut the show of affection triggered a swath of snark and ugly comments from internet trolls, many of them MAGA supporters of former President Donald Trump, who faces Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Walz in November.\n\n– Michael Collins and Sam Woodward\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nThere's a good chance you'd recognize Nadine Seiler. The 59-year-old woman has developed a knack for being at the right place at the right time to get photographed by the media as she protests former President Donald Trump and conservative policies like the Agenda 2025 plan to remake the federal government.\n\nMultiple news photographers have captured Seiler's protests across the country since at least 2019, from Chicago to Milwaukee to Miami to outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nThis isn't how she'd planned to spend her retirement savings after arriving in the United States from the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago nearly 40 years ago. But with her bright makeup and eye-catching signs, protest has become her calling. In Chicago, she's sleeping in a friend's van so she can keep costs down.\n\n\"I am crazy,\" Seiler said with a laugh. \"Nobody who is totally sane would do this.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nHarris celebrates nomination + 10-year wedding anniversary\n\nKamala Harris will take the stage tonight to formally accept her party’s presidential nomination.

There was no coup, however; the party turned to Vice President Harris after Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\nTo be sure, Trump did use most of his remarks Thursday to criticize the Bush-Harris administration's record on border security. The event that lasted more than an hour also featured family members who have lost loved ones in crimes committed by people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn criticizing Harris, Trump said Harris \"will not mention the victims\" in her acceptance speech on Thursday night. During the convention, Democratic speakers said Trump is also responsible for border problems, having used his power over Republican lawmakers to block legislation that would have tightened the border.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhite House slams ‘anti-Semitic’ Donald Trump post targeting Josh Shapiro\n\nThe White House condemned a social media post from Donald Trump as “Antisemitic, dangerous and hurtful” after the former president referred to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and slammed his support for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social Wednesday night after Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, wrote that Shapiro “made a really bad and poorly delivered speech” for Harris – someone who Trump said “hates Israel and will do nothing” to help Israel survive.\n\n“Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,” Trump wrote. “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.”\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, was among the final contenders for Harris’ vice-presidential running-mate before Harris ultimately picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. White House spokesman Herbie Ziskend, in a statement, called it “Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’”\n\nZiskend added: “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kinds.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters take the spotlight during DNC. What impact will they make?\n\nIt's been no 1968.\n\nThe prospect that massive protests over the war in Gaza would dominate the Democratic National Convention and bring mayhem to the streets of Chicago both energized supporters and instilled unease in others.\n\nBut headlines out of Chicago instead have been splashed with Democratic enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies? No,” she said. “But are they scared of a leader who’s gonna go after his enemies, and reward his friends, and turn us into a banana republic? Turns out they don’t like that.”\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nKlobuchar: 'There is a lot of competition about competition'\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention last month, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s support for anti-monopoly measures set off a flurry of messaging from Democrats, as they sought to reassure voters that they, not the GOP, are the party of workers and economic progressivism.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Thursday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel. Last month, Gaza war activists released insects at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C. in an effort to disrupt the stay of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne witness staying at the Fairmont told USA TODAY the insects appeared to be crickets, while other news reports suggested maggots.

She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F.

Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view: Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

It prompted a manhunt that spanned multiple states.\n\nEight of the 10 were captured earlier, most in New Orleans and two in Texas. Earlier this month, Massey posted a social media video proclaiming his innocence.\n\nMassey, who stood out for his face tattoos of chess pieces, was in jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation and theft of a motor vehicle. Officials said new charges were forthcoming.\n\nHis arrest means that only one escapee, Derrick Groves, remains on the lam. Groves, 27, was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018.\n\n\"Great work by all our law enforcement partners who have been working so hard for this outcome. 1 more to go!” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media.\n\nNew Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick urged Groves to turn himself in. Either way, she said, “you will be taken into custody.”\n\nThe escapes, which sent several prosecutors and victims fleeing for safety, raised questions about the jail’s operations and highlighted a facility that the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office said was overcrowded and in need of security upgrades.\n\nSheriff Susan Hutson, whose department operates the jail and has faced intense scrutiny over the escapes, personally received the tip June 27 that led to the arrest.\n\n\"This is a major step forward in our efforts to restore order and accountability after this serious incident,\" she said at a news conference in New Orleans.\n\nAuthorities had offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the fugitives’ arrests.\n\nMassey had been hiding in a home in a New Orleans neighborhood that is less than 2 miles from the jail. He peacefully gave up when police surrounded it around 3:30 p.m. June 27, authorities said. Police are still examining who might have helped him.\n\nThe captures come as Louisiana authorities continue to investigate how the men were able to create a hole in a cell wall by ripping out a toilet and to escape without being noticed by guards in the early hours of May 16. Their absences were not discovered until the next morning.\n\nHutson has said the escapees appeared to have gotten help from the inside. One maintenance worker was arrested. In addition, she said the jail suffered from underfunding and a shortage of staff. Her critics have blamed mismanagement.\n\nOn June 27, she noted that the jail was already working to secure locks and add razor wire and other security measures as part of a larger effort to improve the facility.\n\nLouisiana State Police said Massey would be transported to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the state’s oldest and only maximum-security prison.\n\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/09/history-violence-plagues-dannemore-prison/28733529/", "title": "History of violence plagues Dannemora prison", "text": "Associated Press\n\nALBANY, N.Y. — The maximum-security prison where two killers pulled off a \"Shawshank Redemption\"-style escape has a reputation for brutality that belies the reform-minded ideals it was founded upon when it opened on an Adirondack mountainside in 1845.\n\nBack then, the Dannemora state prison a few miles from the Canadian border was supposed to be the beacon of a new reform movement that advocated humane treatment of prisoners instead of the torture practiced downstate at Sing Sing. In keeping with that philosophy, the warden didn't even punish two inmates who escaped a month after the prison opened and were quickly recaptured in the harsh surrounding landscape.\n\n\"That reform mindset didn't last,\" said Jeff Hall, a history professor at Queensborough Community College who wrote his doctoral dissertation on Adirondack prisons. \"Within a decade, Dannemora was using a dungeon for solitary confinement, as well as a chair bath, which was basically waterboarding. As more and more prisoners were sent there, it became ungovernable.\"\n\nToday, nearly two centuries later, the 3,000-inmate prison retains an infamous reputation for brutality that ranks it among the worst in the New York state prison system.\n\nA 2014 report by the Correctional Association of New York, an independent nonprofit group that inspects state prisons, found Clinton Correctional Facility is a place where there is little oversight, guards regularly beat inmates and racial tension festers between prisoners and corrections officers.\n\nThe report found that while 63 percent of inmates statewide are locked up for violent crimes, at Clinton, that figure is about 90 percent. Inmates there report among the highest rates of inmate-on-inmate fights in all state prisons, driven by gang feuds and drug disputes.\n\nNotable past inmates include mobster Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano; New York City nightlife legend Michael Alig; and rappers Tupac Shakur, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Shyne.\n\nState Assemblyman Daniel O'Donnell visited Clinton last September and was told repeatedly by inmates that brutality inflicted by both guards and fellow inmates was a problem.\n\n\"I asked the inmate council, 'Are you safe here?' And the guys at Clinton burst out laughing they thought the question was just funny. But it wasn't,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nAny inmate who might have heard David Sweat and Richard Matt sawing through their steel cell walls with power tools wouldn't dream of saying anything, due to a culture of violence and fear that dictates a strict code of silence.\n\n\"Let me be clear, that will get you killed, that's the kind of environment it is,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nThe facility itself is massive, O'Donnell said, with dank, dark cell blocks and facilities that are great distances away from one another, ill-equipped for full security camera coverage.\n\nJim Miller, a spokesman for the union representing state prison guards, said it would be inappropriate to make any comment about the culture of Clinton while the search for the prisoners was ongoing.\n\nThe prison was built on a mountainside with the goals of relieving crowding at Sing Sing and putting the transplanted inmates to work operating an iron mine and forge. The village that grew up around the prison was named Dannemora, after a mining district in Sweden.\n\n\"The state lost money on the iron mine operation,\" said Hall, who grew up in the Adirondacks. \"Eventually the prison had to give inmates other things to do and they started other traditional prison industries like making caps, military uniforms, license plates and government office furniture.\"\n\nThe prison is like a village within the village that clings to its perimeter wall. There's the Church of St. Dismas, the Good Thief, constructed by inmates of fieldstones and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At one time there was a ski jump for inmate use. There was a tuberculosis hospital and an insane asylum, which have been converted to other uses.\n\nThe prison was originally built of wood harvested on the site, but later expanded with buildings constructed of red granite mined nearby on Dannemora Mountain, said Peter Light, a retired corrections officer who started a two-room history museum at the prison.\n\nThe buildings are heated by steam piped from a powerhouse outside the 40-foot-high perimeter wall. It was through one of those 24-inch-diameter pipes that Sweat and Matt escaped.\n\nBecause of its age, the facility is constantly undergoing renovations and repairs, Light said. \"In so doing, you have a lot of contractors who come in.\"\n\nInvestigators are looking into the possibility that the escapees got their power tools from an outside contractor.\n\nO'Donnell said when the escapees are caught, they'll likely spend the rest of their lives in isolation, \"in a living hell.\"\n\nEARLIER COVERAGE\n\nVermont stays on alert for escaped prisoners", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/16/new-orleans-jailbreak-manhunt-push-fixes/83996315007/", "title": "New Orleans jailbreak, a manhunt and push to fix a city's broken jail", "text": "On May 16, 10 men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center, the main jail in New Orleans.\n\nThe manhunt to catch the escapees has cost the city of New Orleans alone $500,000.\n\nThe state legislature in Louisiana has approved $1.8 million for expenses.\n\nThe escape was one of America's largest and most brazen in recent memory and set off a fresh round of soul-searching over New Orleans’ troubled history of incarceration.\n\nOn June 27, the ninth escapee was captured. One remains at large.\n\nNEW ORLEANS – They waited until after midnight to make their move.\n\nAs nearly 1,400 inmates at the sprawling New Orleans jail slept, 10 men slipped quietly from their metal bunks. A worker monitoring their tier by surveillance camera went on break.\n\nBy 12:22 a.m., several inmates in orange and white prison clothing were forcing open the door of an empty cell.\n\nAn audacious escape plan was unfolding.\n\nBut to reach freedom on this muggy Louisiana night, everything would have to go right.\n\nThey would have to wrench a toilet from the wall to open a passage. Get past steel bars. Climb a wall tipped with barbed wire.\n\nAll without being spotted in a jail that bristled with 900 surveillance cameras.\n\nAbout an hour later, the men — some facing charges for violent crimes including second-degree murder — were scrambling across an interstate highway before disappearing into the city just a few miles from Bourbon Street.\n\nAll that was left was a drawing of a face, its tongue sticking out, above the misspelled but taunting phrase, “To Easy LoL,” scrawled above a rectangular hole in the cell wall.\n\nThe May 16 jailbreak at the Orleans Justice Center marked one of America’s largest and most brazen escapes in recent memory – one seemingly straight out of Hollywood.\n\nIt prompted a costly manhunt that gripped the city. It sent prosecutors and victims fleeing for safety. It fueled political fallout. And it would highlight dangerous conditions in the city’s jail, setting off a fresh round of soul-searching over New Orleans’ troubled history of incarceration.\n\nHow, many in the city wondered, could they have broken out of a jail that was nine years old? How would police catch 10 scattered fugitives? And would the debacle bring change to a jail that had seemingly failed to turn the page on the city’s long-struggling lockups?\n\nBut those answers would all come later.\n\nAs the sun rose on the Big Easy that morning, no one at the jail – at least not jail leaders – had any idea the prisoners were missing.\n\nDelayed discovery fuels fear\n\nOrleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams' phone started pinging the next morning at his office, which has windows looking toward the nearby jail.\n\n“Is it true that there was some sort of jailbreak?” a reporter's text message asked.\n\nNot far away, New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick was in a meeting around 10:30 a.m. when she heard. “We quickly kind of looked at each other and said, ‘Let’s verify this,’” she said.\n\nThe news set off a scramble to learn what had happened.\n\nA routine morning headcount had been conducted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which runs the Orleans Justice Center jail. Not long after 8:30 a.m., jail staff realized that at least several inmates were missing.\n\nThe facility went on lockdown. A frantic internal search began. Guards checked passageways, crawlspaces and housing units. Not long after, the sheriff’s office notified the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nAmid reviews of surveillance footage, it ultimately became apparent that 10 men had escaped.\n\nBy the time the first absences were discovered, the men had more than a 7-hour head start, which would fuel sharp criticism and anger across the city.\n\n“Do not engage or approach these subjects,” Sheriff Susan Hutson said at a news conference on the steps of the jail later that morning.\n\nMost of the fugitives were awaiting court proceedings or trials, like most other inmates. The youngest was 19. The oldest was 42.\n\nThere was Antoine Massey, 33, who stood out for his face tattoos of chess pieces and was in jail on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation and theft of a motor vehicle. He was called a “Houdini” in a local report because of past instances of slipping out of ankle monitors and other Louisiana lockups.\n\nThere was Leo Tate Sr., 31, facing charges including burglary and drug possession, and Jermaine Donald, 42, facing charges including second-degree murder. Lenton Vanburen, 26, was arrested on charges of second-degree murder and armed robbery.\n\nAnd there was Derrick Groves, 27, convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in connection with a shooting during Mardi Gras in 2018. It was a difficult case that had to be tried twice and included witness intimidation, the DA said.\n\nGroves also had a link to the city’s dark history of police corruption: In 1996, a corrupt patrol officer who led a drug ring was convicted of ordering the killing of his grandmother, Kim Groves, after she filed a police brutality report, local media reported.\n\nFearing retaliation, two prosecutors who had worked on Groves’ case prepared to leave town with their families. Some witnesses and victims' families were also relocated with the help of prosecutors. A relative of 21-year-old Byron Jackson, killed in the shooting, went to stay with his girlfriend in another part of town, saying he feared for his safety.\n\nThe city suddenly seemed way too small.\n\n“There's one degree of separation in New Orleans,” Williams said. “And so if there's someone you're looking for to cause them harm, you're going to see them.”\n\nAs news spread, one group of conventioneers contacted city tourism officials. They were connected with local police, who were beefing up their presence in the city.\n\nSome residents cited New Orleans’ resilience during tough times – think Hurricane Katrina or after 14 were killed this year after a man drove a speeding truck into New Year’s Day revelers on Bourbon Street – and took it in stride.\n\n“There’s some concern for our safety because they are dangerous criminals. But it’s not like we’re going to stop living our lives,” said Tess Gonzales, manager of Daisy Mae’s Southern Fried Chicken & Breakfast.\n\nIt wasn’t long before some were selling T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase, “To Easy LoL\" as it took off across social media.\n\nOthers who live close to the jail were downright frightened.\n\nIn a New Orleans neighborhood about a mile from the jail, an area dotted with wood-frame homes on stilts with peeling paint, corner stores and small churches, Lakisha Catchings, a mother of eight, said the dangers were keeping her family indoors.\n\n“It's scary,” said the 44-year-old, who grew increasingly angry that the escape put her family in harm's way.\n\n“How did they let this happen?” Catchings asked as she stood near her front door, a welcome sign hanging to one side.\n\n‘Shawshank Redemption on a much bigger scale’\n\nFor law enforcement, the clock was running.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, 80 miles to the west, the Louisiana State Police quickly mustered a 200-member multi-agency task force to search for the fugitives. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill launched an investigation.\n\nNew Orleans police also jumped into action, aiding the search while posting patrol cars at schools and safeguarding victims, witnesses and judges connected to the criminal cases of the inmates.\n\nAuthorities hoped it wouldn’t take long. The escape was already a black eye for the jail, generating national headlines as one of the largest in recent memory. And some in the local criminal justice community worried about the fallout from an extended search.\n\nFuture witnesses or victims critical to criminal cases “may have second thoughts about cooperating with law enforcement if they believe that the system isn't capable of preventing people that they may be identifying from escaping,” said Rafael Goyeneche, the head of the city’s Metropolitan Crime Commission.\n\nThe men had fled the jail with no money, phones, food, transportation or changes of clothing. So there was a good chance some would turn to people they knew for help.\n\nInvestigators raced to check jail phone logs to see who might have known ahead of time. They searched out relatives and friends who might know their whereabouts. Police turned to a private network of facial recognition cameras whose use had been under review.\n\nRewards for tips leading to their capture were announced. They would eventually grow to $50,000 each.\n\n“We understand that some of you might be reporting a friend, a loved one, a relative and albeit not easy, it is critical to your safety and the safety of the public that you report them,” Jonathan Tapp, head of the FBI office in New Orleans, said at a news conference.\n\nBut getting some residents to cooperate was complicated by distrust linked to the city’s past history of police abuses – including corruption and unconstitutional arrests that led to years of federal oversight. On top of that, the city’s lockups had historically been places known for violence.\n\nSome residents, as a result, might be “reluctant to participate in an investigation like this,” said Stella Cziment, a former defense attorney who is now an independent police monitor.\n\nOfficials expressed confidence. And experts said that typically more than 90% of the nation’s roughly 2,000 inmates who escape each year are recaptured.\n\nBut Goyeneche said such escapes are most common during a work or medical release, rather than busting through jail walls and taking time to scrawl a mocking message.\n\n“It was too easy,” he said. “This was ‘Shawshank Redemption’ on a much bigger scale.”\n\nEscapees seek aid and cover\n\nOn the morning of the escape, two of the men were seen walking in black hoodies and jeans near Hustler Hollywood on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, a popular destination for tourists.\n\nSuch clues led investigators to believe many were still in town in the days after the breakout.\n\nAnthony Cangelosi, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former U.S. Marshal and Secret Service agent, said that those with a larger network of resources were likely to last the longest.\n\nFor some, that included friends or family members.\n\nVanburen allegedly got help from one person in driving him to a relative’s home and helping him contact family, while another person offered him a hiding place in a vacant apartment, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOthers turned to people they knew for money and rides. Some covered their tracks including by using internet phone service.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the escape, however, police had zeroed in on several fugitives.\n\nAfter a foot chase in the French Quarter, police recaptured Kendell Myles after finding him hiding under a car parked near the swanky Hotel Monteleone, which boasts a seafood restaurant and a heated rooftop pool.\n\nDkanen Dennis was detained while staying in a house in an eastern city neighborhood.\n\nAnd by that evening, a tip led authorities just down the street where Catchings and her family were hunkered down and some residents were afraid to talk to reporters for fear of retaliation.\n\nRon Wicker, who lives with his father in the home they’ve owned and lived in since the 1940s, watched as a flood of unmarked police cars descended on the house next door around 7:30 p.m. as the sun set on his threadbare street.\n\nHe saw escapee Robert Moody, 21, wearing camouflage pants, hauled back into custody, where he had been held on drug and weapon charges. It was both a relief and a reminder more could be hiding nearby.\n\n“I couldn’t believe he was next door,” Wicker said.\n\nOthers, however, would prove more difficult to find.\n\nDetails of the escape emerge\n\nFour days after the escape, Hutson wore a white uniform shirt with a gold sheriff's star as she sat in a New Orleans city council hearing room filled with TV news cameras.\n\nWith the city on edge, intense scrutiny had fallen on the sheriff, who had suspended her reelection campaign to seek a second term but not heeded calls to resign.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry had already said the jailbreak demonstrated a systemic failure. Jean-Paul Morrell, a city council member, said people were “terrified, upset and angry.” Now the council wanted to hear how inmates had pulled off the escape.\n\nHutson and her top staffers said there were procedural failures and apparent “wrongdoing” by some inside the jail, and was compounded by security gaps stemming from poor infrastructure, overcrowding and inadequate staffing.\n\nShe took full responsibility, calling the escape “deeply troubling,\" and vowed to correct lapses.\n\nAt the time of the escape, no deputy was assigned to the pod. A civilian worker stationed at a module where cameras can be viewed had briefly stepped away for food. At times, short staffing meant there was no one to cover for such breaks.\n\nGoyeneche said staff are supposed to do physical checks and that lights in observation booths should indicate if cells are locked.\n\nHutson's office said that by 12:43 a.m., multiple inmates entered the cell door they’d jarred open earlier.\n\nBefore they could pull off the sink-toilet unit affixed to the wall, they needed the water turned off to avoid flooding. Jail maintenance worker Sterling Williams was arrested, accused of aiding the escape by turning off the water. His lawyer said he did so because of a clogged toilet, not to aid in the escape.\n\nIn addition, three employees were suspended pending an investigation, Hutson's office said, without detailing why.\n\nBehind the sink, at least one steel bar appeared to have been cut using a tool. Orleans Parish Chief of Corrections Jeworski Mallett said breaching the wall near the toilets would not have been possible without outside assistance.\n\nBy around 1 a.m., the inmates had climbed through the hole, one by one, and had passed through a loading dock door. They hustled down a secure perimeter road toward a part of the facility that's under construction. The jail is building a mental health annex next door.\n\nBy 1:19 a.m., they scaled a fence with barbed wire, using blankets to avoid injury. A traffic camera then captured the inmates dashing across Interstate 10 into a neighborhood where investigators later found discarded prison clothing.\n\nHow much help the escapees got from the inside was still under investigation. But Hutson said the escape showed that underfunding had left the jail vulnerable.\n\nThe jail needed $13 million for security and infrastructure upgrades, she said. Her office cited inadequate equipment such as aging cameras, faulty locks and jail infrastructure that has faced heavy damage from a growing population of inmates.\n\nThen there were the staffing shortages. Staff could safely manage 800 inmates but instead were supervising 1,400, many charged with violent crimes.\n\n“We need to harden this facility right now, not next month,” Hutson said.\n\nSome on the council pushed back, questioning whether the city's nearly $65 million in annual funding for the jail was being mismanaged.\n\nOutside of the council chambers, critics saw it as a simple failure to ensure jail staff were doing what they should.\n\n“That wasn't a spontaneous escape. That was something that was planned. And they were able to plan it because they recognized that there were flaws in the Sheriff's Office not following their own protocols,” Goyeneche said.\n\nEscape resurfaces historic jail problems\n\nWith the manhunt still in full swing and jail problems in the public spotlight, New Orleans resident Ricky Peterson knew some of the problems were nothing new.\n\nWhen he was briefly locked up shortly after the jail opened nearly a decade ago, he said, inmates had already figured out a way to jam up the locks with tissue.\n\n“It’s not hard to do,” he said.\n\nThe Orleans Justice Center, designed with rows of reflective glass, was opened in 2015. Many hoped it would turn the page on the notorious conditions at the former Orleans Parish Prison, known for years as an overcrowded and dangerous jail.\n\nIn 2009 – a few years after Hurricane Katrina swamped the city’s complex of crumbling lockups — a Justice Department report found inadequate staffing, supervision, mental and medical health services and sanitation.\n\nIt cited an inability to keep inmates safe and instances of “calculated abuse” by deputies who would beat prisoners.\n\nThree years later, a Southern Poverty Law Center lawsuit alleged that “rapes, sexual assaults, and beatings are commonplace.” It alleged that people with mental health struggles were going untreated.\n\n“As hellholes go, there are few worse places in America than the Orleans Parish Prison,” Mother Jones wrote in 2012 in a story about the suit.\n\nVideo footage around that time showed inmates, with no apparent supervision, using drugs, drinking, gambling with cash and even holding a gun.\n\nThe conditions led to federal court oversight and efforts to overhaul policies and reduce violence, with the Justice Department citing “physical and sexual assaults, inadequate medical care, and risks of suicide and mental health decompensation.”\n\nAfter spending roughly $150 million to build what was considered state-of-the-art at the time, problems didn’t evaporate. In recent years, federal monitors have cited “extremely inadequate” staffing levels and lax supervision.\n\nIn October 2024, the monitors found night shift guards performed only 7% of the security checks indicated on their logs. Assigned staff left units unattended for meal breaks. Deputies faced inmate harassment.\n\nInmate violence was at an \"all-time high” with prisoners making weapons, including by prying metal sheeting from windows or sinks in the janitor closets. Some inmates roamed freely, refused to follow staff orders and extorted fellow prisoners.\n\nA lack of effective random searches led to the presence of pills and narcotics. Inmates were often observed smoking illegal substances.\n\nIn 2024, the mother of inmate Terry Carter, who struggled with mental illness, filed a lawsuit after her son died from a drug overdose in the facility in 2023. The suit alleged he had previously overdosed while incarcerated and accused the jail of “failure to stop or even reduce the flow of contraband.”\n\nTwo weeks before the May 16 escape, two other inmates allegedly tried to escape through the ceiling of the same pod, local media reported.\n\n“Too often the failure to follow policy is blamed on the lack of staff or training,” the monitors wrote in one report. “Neither is an acceptable excuse.”\n\nDespite the jail’s troubles, Peterson said he believes the 10-man escape would have been extremely difficult to pull off without some help.\n\n“I immediately thought, inside job,” he said.\n\nCaptures grow including outside accomplices\n\nIn a flat stretch of east Texas on May 26, a white SUV sped down a two-lane road more than 300 miles from New Orleans.\n\nMore than a dozen police cars, sirens wailing, were on its tail.\n\nThe vehicle made quick turns, hoping to shake the pursuing line of cruisers.\n\nState police finally stopped the car on a rural road outside of Huntsville, north of Houston. Officers with weapons raised surrounded the SUV and demanded the passengers get out.\n\n\"I'm not opening, are you kidding me?\" one passenger said before officers got him out of the vehicle and put him into handcuffs, according to police video footage.\n\nIt marked the capture of Leo Tate Sr. and Jermaine Donald. Tate, wearing orange prison clothing and cuffs, was flown back to Louisiana on a state police aircraft.\n\nBy that time, police had arrested eight escapees and sent most to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.\n\nGary Price had been captured after neighbors said had been hiding at a vacant home in east New Orleans.\n\nLenton Vanburen Jr. got picked up while sitting on a bench in a Baton Rouge shopping center.\n\nCorey Boyd was captured while hiding in an apartment by a SWAT team. Later, Corvanntay Baptiste, 38, was accused of hiding Boyd and feeding him while he was in hiding.\n\nShe was among a growing number of arrests of people who aided them, many held on bonds $1 million or higher, with some facing charges of accessory after the fact.\n\nAuthorities reportedly staked out and searched the New Orleans home of Massey’s sister but didn’t locate him. The alleged victim of Massey’s abuse was also arrested and charged with acting as a principal to an aggravated escape and obstructing justice.\n\nAs May drew closer to its end, there were just two inmates left to capture.\n\n“Antoine and Derrick — you are NEXT!” Landry, who announced an independent investigation into the escape, wrote on social media.\n\nBut they needed more tips, especially from friends and family. On May 29, authorities increased the tip reward to $50,000.\n\n“Soon as we get one lead, they relocate to somewhere else, whether that’s a home or businesses,” Louisiana State Police Superintendent Col. Robert Hodges said.\n\nHe didn’t believe the fugitives had the resources to cross international borders.\n\nInvestigators also knew their support was likely centered in or around New Orleans.\n\n\"They're tired,” Hodges said. “They're looking over their shoulder.”\n\nEscape fuels political fights, calls for change\n\nNearly three weeks later, the escapes were proving a wake-up call for change.\n\nSeveral state agencies were conducting audits expected to result in recommended changes in jail policy, staffing and facility upgrades.\n\nAnd the jail was working on new measures – including more security checks, a second perimeter fence, lock improvements and reducing crowding with transfers.\n\n“The only good that can come from anything like this is to figure out what went wrong and make the changes that reduce the potential for this happening again,” Goyeneche said.\n\nBut the search for longer-term solutions also came amid growing political fallout.\n\nLandry, the Republican governor, blamed jail crowding on progressive elected officials in New Orleans. Hutson accused the district attorney of “personal animus and political campaigning” in light of his support for a rival candidate in the upcoming sheriff’s race.\n\nSome city leaders clashed with the sheriff’s office, blaming mismanagement rather than a lack of funding.\n\nMorrell, the city council member, said former jail employees told him there were thousands of languishing work orders and that jail keys weren’t always collected from former employees. The sheriff’s office called the allegation “misinformation.”\n\n“Maybe you don’t need to have the 'Shawshank Redemption' digging a hole to escape,\" Morrell said in a social media video. \"Maybe he didn’t need to hire or scare a maintenance worker into doing it when any employee could walk out with the keys.\"\n\nMurrill, Louisiana’s attorney general, suggested funding to “keep up with the wear and tear on this building.” Others called for pay increases for new deputies who make about $18 an hour.\n\nSome residents such as Caliegh Flynn noted the city already spends a significant portion of the city’s budget on public safety amid competing needs of schools and city infrastructure.\n\nSarah Omojola, director of the Vera Institute of Justice in New Orleans, hoped a desire to reduce the cost of incarceration would lead the state to rethink a pullback last year of money-saving 2017 criminal justice reforms such as shortening sentences and expanding parole.\n\nWhile Louisiana’s legislature toughened penalties after crime rose during the pandemic, crime is now down in New Orleans, police said.\n\nFreddie King III, a city council member, said it was important to delve into root causes, noting that some escapees had previously been in the juvenile system.\n\n“Are we doing enough as a society, as a city, to ensure that our young, specifically Black men, don’t end up in jail?” he said. “We’re not spending enough money where it truly belongs.”\n\nA potential break, a receding threat\n\nThe man with his face tattooed with chess pieces sat on a stool in front of a nondescript kitchen, looking directly at a camera and proclaiming his innocence.\n\nIt was early June, and Massey – still on the run – took to social media to deny he was the mastermind behind the jail break.\n\n\"I didn’t break out. I was let out,” he said.\n\nAsking for help from a litany of celebrities, including President Donald Trump, he said he fled because he was innocent of his charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation.\n\nA day after the video was posted, police raided a house where the video might have been filmed. It was just three miles from jail, NOLA.com reported. He wasn’t there.\n\n“Turn yourself in and you’ll be able to have your day in court,” Landry said at a news conference.\n\nMassey’s grandfather, Lee Taylor, told CBS that he was worried for his grandson, who is a father to a 17-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son.\n\n\"I haven't slept,” he said. “I haven't been eating, and I've lost 15 pounds.”\n\nBy that point, the effort to recapture had cost $500,000 for the city government alone. The Louisiana legislature set aside $1.8 million for expenses related to the manhunt, according to news reports.\n\nAnother potential break came on June 9, when U.S. Marshals Service arrested Darriana Burton, 28, and accused her of aiding in Groves' escape. She was believed to be Groves' girlfriend, the attorney general's office said in a statement, and had formerly worked at the jail.\n\nMurrill said in a television interview that while the threat to the public has been reduced with the captures, the two remaining escapees were still “dangerous ” to witnesses in their cases and the community in general.\n\nAs the days in June started ticking by, the escapees who remained on the lam were not putting a noticeable dent in tourism or scheduled conventions, local officials said. The escapees fell out of the daily news headlines.\n\nKirkpatrick, the New Orleans police chief, said at least one of the escapees may still be in the New Orleans metro area.\n\nAnd she was right.\n\nOn June 27, six weeks after the escape, Hutson personally got a tip about Massey's whereabouts. Authorities were soon surrounding a home in a New Orleans neighborhood, one about two miles from the jail.\n\nMassey came out and gave up peacefully.\n\nHutson and Kirkpatrick \"had a moment\" together as they talked on the phone to plan a news conference. The relief was palpable, Hutson recalled.\n\nBut there was still one left.\n\nIn her neighborhood, not far from the jail, Alayciea “Lacy” Favaroth, 34, who has a teenage daughter, said she saw her neighbor’s home raided by a SWAT team. She lives in the same block as Massey’s sister, who was taken into custody.\n\nFavaroth said the ordeal was pushing her to search for a new place to live where she feels safer.\n\n“I really can’t believe it’s been that long. It's crazy that they really are still out there. And you just don't know where,” she said. “This definitely is going down in history.”\n\nWhen the jailbreak’s final chapter is written, it may become the latest in New Orleans’ tumultuous history, she said, one that has fueled the city’s famous resilience.\n\nAnd maybe, one that brings change along with it.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY staff\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the June 27 capture of fugitive Antoine Massey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/09/16/kid-rock-wynonna-and-murderers-shared-jail/89438296/", "title": "Kid Rock, Wynonna and murderers shared a jail", "text": "Brad Schmitt\n\nbrad@tennessean.com\n\nVirtually every person arrested in Nashville has been taken to the Criminal Justice Center since it was built in 1982.\n\nNearly 1 million people — including dozens of country singers, Tennessee Titans and serial killers — have spent some time at CJC.\n\nAs construction crews get ready to start tearing it down this week to build a new one on the same spot, we asked insiders for stories from inside those walls.\n\nSerial killer Paul Dennis Reid was a dandy\n\nDavidson County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Karla West remembers taking an incredibly creepy walk with serial killer Paul Dennis Reid.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nPolice said Reid, also known as the “Fast Food Killer,” had murdered seven people in 1997, two at a Donelson Captain D’s, three at a McDonald’s in Hermitage and two at a Baskin-Robbins in Clarksville.\n\nWest and three guards walked with Reid in a dank underground tunnel that connected the CJC and the old courthouse.\n\n“All you could hear was the clinking of his belly chains and his leg irons,” she said. “No one was speaking.”\n\nThe one thing that did make her smile that day: He slowed down anytime he passed a reflective surface — glass, shiny metal or a mirror.\n\n“He would make sure his hair looked good,” West said, smiling.\n\n“There was a lot of talk about how much vanity was involved with him.”\n\nReid died in custody in 2013 at age 55 at Nashville General Hospital.\n\nWynonna serenades her cellmates\n\nNo one else on earth could pull this off.\n\nCountry singer Wynonna Judd is one of dozens of country stars arrested for DUI since the CJC opened in 1982.\n\nBut she’s believed to be the only one who serenaded her fellow arrestees in the CJC holding area after getting booked, Sheriff Daron Hall said.\n\n“There were 40 or 50 people sitting in here waiting to be processed,” Hall said, “and all of a sudden, she started singing, and everybody got a kick out of it.”\n\nWynonna got charged with DUI early in the morning in November 2003 after being pulled over for speeding through Hillsboro Village.\n\nThe jailhouse concert started shortly afterward, and guards had mixed feelings about it.\n\n“Everybody started cheering her on a little bit,” Hall said. “We got her processed out of here in time to calm everybody down.\n\n“It’s not something you’d want every day in the booking room.”\n\nInmate talked out of hanging himself in front of dozens\n\nAdministrator Austin Bodie was walking out of the CJC for lunch when a guard asked him, “Hey, are you going to the gym?”\n\nBecause of overcrowding, more than 100 inmates were staying on bunks on the basketball court.\n\nThat morning, in early 2000, one of them decided he was going to commit suicide.\n\nHe had tied a sheet around his neck, shimmied up the basketball goal and tied the other end of the sheet to a rafter over his head. More than 20 guards stood around, trying to talk the inmate into coming down safely. But the inmate wasn’t listening.\n\nBodie’s stomach lurched.\n\nHe pulled up a bunk bed and put a 12-foot ladder on top of the upper bunk and climbed the ladder to talk to the inmate face to face.\n\n“He talked about his kids, I talked about my kids,” Bodie said. “Eventually I got him to the point where he was willing to come down.”\n\nThat’s when Bodie realized he was in a precarious position himself: “I was scared to death of him slipping and taking me down.”\n\nA happy ending: The inmate untied the sheet, and both came down the ladder, slowly and safely.\n\nA jailhouse snitch does in Perry March\n\nThe scandal rocked the affluent, the legal and the Jewish communities of Nashville.\n\nArtist/socialite Janet March disappeared in 1995, and her lawyer husband, Perry March, was arrested as a suspect.\n\nThe CJC played a major role — 10 years later — in getting the first conviction against March.\n\nIt was there that March started to confide in — and plan homicides with — the guy in the cell next door, Nathaniel Farris.\n\n“Perry confided in Nathaniel Farris, asking him to kill the Levines, the parents of Janet March, and that was the beginning of the end of that case,” Hall said.\n\nThe two talked through metal wall separating their jail cells and out in the rec yard, but March never realized that Farris was wearing a wire.\n\nMarch, 55, eventually was convicted of second-degree murder, tampering with evidence, abuse of a corpse, conspiring to commit first-degree murder and grand larceny.\n\nHe remains in the state prison system in Morgan County, not eligible for parole until 2038.\n\nBrad Schmitt: It’s the smell that gets ya\n\nIt’s the smell.\n\nIt’s not necessarily bad, though it sure ain’t lavender soap either.\n\nStale air, industrial cleaner, peeling paint, desperation, fear, tequila breath, cigarette smoke and body odor mingled to made a pervasive stench.\n\nI was booked at the Criminal Justice Center for a second DUI more than six years ago.\n\nWhen I visited the empty CJC earlier this month, one whiff unleashed a flood of memories.\n\nEmptying my pockets at a desk in front of an impatient guard. Getting a really, really thorough pat-down.\n\nSlumping in the corner of the vestibule outside for more than 30 minutes because they were backed up.\n\nA kind nurse poking me with a three-prong TB test.\n\nEyeballing a well-known musician while we both wondered if the other would tell. (We didn’t.)\n\nBeing surrounded by dozens and dozens of other criminals — and feeling desperately alone.\n\nA guard gently telling me he knew who I was before putting me in a cell for one — and feeling greatly relieved.\n\nEating the bologna sandwich a guard handed to me and other inmates about six hours after I was arrested.\n\nKnowing I never wanted to come back to this place.\n\nTornado terror: 'Get away from the windows!'\n\nThe CJC didn’t escape the wrath of Nashville’s 1998 tornadoes.\n\nPower went out, water flooded down stairwells, and all the fifth-floor inmates were moved to the ground floor.\n\nWhen things settled down a little, the CJC chief of corrections, Tony Wilkes, left the secured area to catch his breath.\n\nThat didn’t last long.\n\nWilkes saw 10 employees with their faces pressed up against second-story windows, watching strong winds toss around cars and tree limbs outside.\n\nHe, too, got mesmerized for a few minutes by the flying debris before he snapped out of it.\n\n“I finally said, ‘Everyone, get away from the windows! Get back inside and face a wall!’ ” Wilkes said.\n\n“Being the chief of security, (I) couldn’t show any weakness,” he said. “I had to be the calm in the storm.\n\n“But I was as scared as anyone else standing here. It was probably one of the most scary days of my life.”\n\nKid Rock: Look, y’all, we’re famous in France!\n\nThe Detroit rocker/rapper earned his trip to CJC after he punched a strip club DJ a couple of times in February 2005, police say.\n\n“According to staff, he was one of the nicest people we’ve ever booked in jail,” Hall said.\n\nAnd one of the happiest because he got arrested.\n\nWhen guards handed Kid Rock back his cellphone, he turned it on and proudly showed everyone around him Google alerts about his strip club altercation.\n\n“Look, we’re in France! We’re in England! All over the world!” Hall quoted Kid Rock as saying.\n\nJail staff liked Kid Rock, and he loved ‘em right back.\n\nWhen the star walked out of CJC into a crowd of reporters, he told them:\n\n“Everything was wonderful. It was a beautiful night.”\n\nThe Kid even captured the night in song.\n\n“Lowlife (Living the Highlife)” — from the 2007 album “Rock n Roll Jesus” — features the lyrics:\n\n“Ain’t never hung out in the Catskills. But I’ve been to jail in Nashville.

But “hospital bosses refused to believe she was to blame” and were “desperate to protect the reputation of the trust”. The paper estimated as many as nine babies might have been saved or escaped harm had hospital managers and doctors not missed vital opportunities to stop her.\n\nThe problem, said The Times, is that many of the bosses who could have acted sooner to stop Letby have since “retired with big pensions or moved to lucrative new NHS jobs”.\n\nAmong these is the chief executive at the time, Tony Chambers, a former nurse who stepped down from the £160,000-a-year job shortly after Letby’s arrest in 2018. Medical director Ian Harvey, who also retired weeks after Letby’s arrest and now lives in France, is “accused of delaying calling in the police to investigate unexplained deaths on the neonatal ward”, said The Times. While Karen Rees, head of nursing for urgent care and one of Letby’s line managers, allegedly refused to remove her from duty after two babies died within 24 hours.\n\nChambers issued a statement after the guilty verdict saying he would cooperate fully with any inquiry and that “his focus was on the safety of the baby unit and the wellbeing of patients and staff”. Harvey also welcomed a forthcoming inquiry and said that he had been “determined to keep the baby unit safe and support our staff” when he was medical director.\n\n“We never had hard evidence, but we had reached a point where we had explored every other cause. However, the consultant paediatricians didn’t feel there was any further work or investigation – short of a police investigation – that could be done that would satisfy them that some of the deaths weren’t due to natural causes,” he told ITV News.\n\nRees told Sky News she wasn’t given enough information to justify removing Letby from her duties and that she was “currently taking legal advice about the untrue allegations” made against her.\n\nPolice investigating Letby, who was today handed 14 whole-life orders, suggested chances might have been missed because the scale of what was going on was beyond the comprehension of many of her colleagues and those in senior positions at the hospital.\n\n“It was the inability of those around Letby to imagine that a nurse would be deliberately killing babies that allowed her to cause harm for so long, even when it was happening right in front of them,” said the i news site.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Nicola Evans, who co-led the investigation into Letby, put it more bluntly: “Nobody was looking, because why would they? Why would they expect that this would occur?”\n\nWhat next?\n\nThere are growing calls for the government’s inquiry into the scandal – which was announced on Friday following Letby’s conviction – to be beefed up.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay said a non-statutory inquiry would allow lessons to be learned in the quickest way possible. But over the weekend, the former justice secretary Robert Buckland, health committee chair Steve Brine and crossbench peer and former General Medical Council member Alex Carlile joined calls from grieving parents for it to be put on a statutory footing. This would see it led by a judge and have more powers, including being able to force witnesses to appear.\n\nAs with inquiries into previous healthcare killers like Harold Shipman, the Letby case could lead to “big changes in the way NHS staff are vetted and scrutinised”, said Hardman.\n\nFor other workers, she concluded, “it has damaged the bond of trust they have with their ward colleagues in high pressure situations – and the trust that parents put in the people they leave their tiny, desperately vulnerable babies with”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/crime/957233/what-happened-to-logan-mwangi", "title": "What happened to Logan Mwangi? | The Week", "text": "A mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy have been sentenced to life for the murder of Logan Mwangi, a five-year-old boy found partially submerged in the River Ogmore near Bridgend, South Wales, in July 2021.\n\nMwangi, who was described by his school as a “loving, sweet-natured child who was polite and articulate at all times”, experienced horrific injuries at the hands of his family, including having his arm broken by his stepbrother, Craig Mulligan.\n\nHis stepfather, John Cole, 40, will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison, his mother, 31-year-old Angharad Williamson, at least 28 years, and his stepbrother will serve at least 15 years.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Throughout the trial, Mulligan’s identity could not be revealed due to his age, but the reporting restriction was lifted after his sentence was handed down.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, a juror found the trial so distressing that she “suffered recurring nightmares and was off work for more than a month”. The case was halted several times due to its harrowing nature and members of the jury are now calling for more support for others put in similarly emotionally challenging circumstances.\n\nSequence of events\n\nOn 20 July 2021, “11 days before his body was found”, Logan was shut in his bedroom with a baby gate across the doorway after testing positive for Covid-19, reported Sky News. “He had been kept like a prisoner in his small bedroom,” prosecutor Caroline Rees QC told the court.\n\nHis stammer is said to have worsened around this time, particularly when he was around his stepfather, and he “wet himself more frequently and began self-harming”, said the BBC.\n\nOn 26 July, Mulligan – who was not related to Logan, nor to Cole or Williamson, but was raised by Cole from nine months old – moved into the family home. He had been taken into care six months before Logan’s murder after he was assaulted by his mother, said The Guardian.\n\nThe foster family who had cared for the teenager earlier in 2021 said Mulligan referred to Logan as a “monster” and said he wanted to kill him on a number of occasions, the BBC reported.\n\nNearly two weeks after Logan was shut in his room, CCTV footage showed Cole and Mulligan moving the child’s body in a sports bag and dumping it in the nearby river like “fly-tipped rubbish”.\n\nCCTV also caught the pair returning to the house to pick up the dinosaur top he had been wearing, which police later found in a wooded area.\n\nIt is not exactly clear how Logan was murdered “because he was killed in his own home”, said the high court judge presiding over the case. She added that the 56 “catastrophic” injuries suffered by Logan were “the sort of injuries seen in abused children”, said LBC.\n\nThese injuries included extensive bruising and liver and bowel tears which were “so severe they were consistent with those seen in road traffic accidents”, reported the BBC in April.\n\nWilliamson argued that her partner and stepson had attacked the child two days before his body was found and that she had run out of the house in an attempt to get help, but this was rejected by the judge.\n\nAll three were arrested on 4 August. Cole was charged with Logan’s murder and all three were charged with perverting the course of justice. Before she was taken into the police car, Williamson insisted that she hadn’t “done anything wrong, I haven’t done anything. I asked for your help and you’re blaming me”. All denied any involvement in Logan’s death, but “Cole later accepted he disposed of the body after Logan died in the house”, said the CPS.\n\nPrevious safeguarding referral\n\nLogan had been known to the social services as a safeguarding referral was made after he suffered a broken arm in August 2020. However, a month before his death, “the family were removed from the child protection register, meaning it was believed there was no longer a risk of significant harm”, said Sky News.\n\nThe five-year-old had also suffered a broken collarbone in the weeks before he died, but never received medical treatment for his injury.\n\nA social services investigation is now underway into the circumstances surrounding Logan’s death – specifically the fact that Mulligan had been allowed to move back into the family home.\n\nCalls are also being made for a national child safeguarding inquiry to take place in Wales. A national review has already began in England following the murders of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, six, and one-year-old Star Hobson, said the Evening Standard.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s Heledd Fychan, who represents the South Wales Central region, described Wales as an “outlier” and “the only nation in the UK that isn’t undertaking a review”.\n\n“It just isn’t good enough,” she added. “Plaid Cymru believes that the rights of the child should be brought fully into Welsh law.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/crime/959307/how-did-met-police-officer-david-carrick-get-away-with-it-for-so-long", "title": "How did Met Police officer David Carrick get away with it for so long ...", "text": "Questions are being asked about how a serving Metropolitan Police officer convicted of multiple sexual offences including 24 rapes was allowed to carry on unchecked for so long despite numerous complaints against him over many years.\n\nIt has been revealed that PC David Carrick had pleaded guilty to 49 charges against 12 victims covering a total of 85 separate offences over nearly two decades, making him one of Britain’s most prolific rapists.\n\nYet while the “details are harrowing”, said The New Statesman’s Rachel Cunliffe, the “really chilling bit is that none of this should have been a surprise”.

This consent has real conditions attached; when police behave badly, as they did at Charing Cross, co-operation is withdrawn and suspicion grows until the whole fragile structure is re-erected.”\n\nBut trust has to be earned, said Anna Birley, a councillor who co-founded the Reclaim These Streets group after Sarah Everard’s murder, in The Independent.\n\n“How do we trust an institution if thousands of decades-old allegations are only just being dealt with properly now?” she said, adding that while it is “right this review is happening, it’s enraging that women have been gaslit by the police for so long.”\n\nBirley said: “We are tired of being told misogyny is being dealt with, when every fresh horror that emerges from the Met shows us that they categorically are not.”\n\nHistory suggests the “scale and entrenched nature of Scotland Yard’s problems is beyond the reach of individual commissioners”, said Otter. “But permanent change in the Met will require a long-term plan, and one to which successive commissioners are obliged to commit. This means the Home Office and London mayor will have to see it through.\n\n“Many would say I’m naive to even imagine this might happen. I sincerely hope I am not.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/22/feeding-animals-crowding-paradise-fighting-coastal-erosion-news-around-states/117158660/", "title": "Feeding the animals, crowding paradise: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The Federal Aviation Administration is considering a plan to land commercial space vehicles in the state. The agency recently released information about a proposal by the Huntsville airport and Nevada-based Sierra Space to use the site roughly 15 miles west of downtown to land ships that resemble a small space shuttle with upswept wings, WHNT-TV reports. The spacecraft would be launched elsewhere and land on an existing runway in Huntsville, which has the largest commercial airport in north Alabama and is a hub for the aerospace industry. The Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority said the FAA is conducting a preliminary review of the proposal. A study completed in 2015 found the airport compatible for the so-called Dream Chaser, which Sierra Space describes as a “spaceplane” designed to take crew and cargo into low-Earth orbit. It would be launched on an Atlas V rocket. Both the airport and the company would need licenses before any landings could occur.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A split federal appeals court panel has sent back for further legal review a 2019 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw proposed restrictions on large-scale mining in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the matter back to a lower court to determine whether the agency’s action “was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to law.” The appeals court panel expresses “no view on that question,” the decision dated Thursday said. The EPA during the Obama administration proposed but never finalized restrictions on large-scale mining in response to the Pebble Mine project. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the agency withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine” and allowing the project to be vetted through the permitting process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last fall rejected a key permit for the proposed copper and gold mine. Pebble’s developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, is appealing that decision. Trout Unlimited and other groups sued over the EPA’s 2019 decision. Nelli Williams, Alaska director for Trout Unlimited, called the ruling “an important step toward providing immediate Clean Water Act safeguards for Bristol Bay.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: A wig store that serves people who’ve lost their hair to chemotherapy continues to require shoppers to wear masks to protect people with cancer from COVID-19. But last month, the suburban Phoenix shop started receiving harassing phone calls after the founder of an anti-mask group tried to ruin the business by posting its name, phone number and address on social media. Since then, Sunny’s Hair and Wigs has received an outpouring of support from concerned citizens and even a visit from Mesa Mayor John Giles and city Councilman Francisco Heredia. “It’s just been overwhelming,” shop owner Lisa Memberr said. Memberr said her staff has been inundated with phone calls and visits from complete strangers bringing food, treats and some cash and “just letting them know that people care and that we are not alone in this and that they support what we did and are taking action to show that.” The store recently received a check for $1,000 from a woman in New Jersey to help buy wigs for people undergoing cancer treatment. The store was targeted May 28 by Ethan Schmidt, the 23-year-old founder of an anti-mask group who travels around metro Phoenix confronting businesses that still require customers to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 while claiming he is the victim of discrimination.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The head of the flagship University of Arkansas campus announced Thursday that he was stepping down, citing the challenge of leading the school in “today’s polarized society.” University of Arkansas Chancellor Joe Steinmetz’s resignation, which took effect Friday, came after the UA Board of Trustees met in executive session but took no action. “I still strongly believe in the mission of higher education, yet given the many challenges found trying to manage a university in today’s polarized society, I need to do what’s best for my family and I feel ready to make way for others,” Steinmetz said in a statement announcing his decision. He did not elaborate. Steinmetz’s resignation also followed his recommendation last month to move a campus statue of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright in response to complaints about Fulbright’s support of segregationist legislation. Republican lawmakers during a hearing last week told Steinmetz that such a move would violate a new state law protecting monuments and could result in criminal charges. Steinmetz has served as the school’s chancellor since January 2016. The university said in a release that UA System President Donald R. Bobbitt would visit with the campus and the school’s supporters before announcing plans for choosing the next chancellor.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is now offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccinations that they can use to access businesses or events that require proof they got the shots. The state’s public health and technology departments said the new tool allows Californians access to their COVID-19 records from the state’s immunization registry and includes the same information as the paper cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To access the information, Californians will enter into a state website their name, date of birth, and the email or phone associated with their vaccine records, and they will be asked to create a four-digit PIN. The record will include a QR code that users can save to their mobile phones. With nearly 20 million people fully vaccinated in California and proof of vaccination already required in some circumstances such as travel, state health officials felt there would be demand for the tool, though it remains optional, said Dr. Erica Pan, the state’s epidemiologist. “The odds are someone is going to misplace their paper CDC card, and a digital COVID-19 vaccine record provides a convenient backup,” she told reporters Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A coalition that wants to ask voters to approve higher taxes on recreational marijuana to help children make up for learning losses during the pandemic and address special needs for low-income and disadvantaged students said it’s been endorsed by former Democratic and Republican governors. Learning Opportunities for Colorado’s Kids is circulating petitions in hopes of collecting nearly 250,000 voter signatures needed by Aug. 2 to place its initiative on the November ballot. The campaign said former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, former Republican Gov. Bill Owens, state lawmakers from both parties, and a host of educational and advocacy groups, many serving Black and Latino children, have endorsed the effort. Initiative 25 would create a Colorado Learning Authority within the state education department to oversee out-of-school tutoring, English language instruction, special needs and disability instruction, mental health, and career and technical training for children ages 5 to 17. It would generally help children from low-income families and those falling behind their grade levels by certifying tutors, who can be teachers doing the work outside regular hours. To pay for the program, backers want voters to approve a 5% excise tax increase on recreational marijuana by 2024 to generate more than $137 million a year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: One of the state’s legendary music clubs is reopening after a yearlong closure due to the pandemic, with the help of the federal government. Toad’s Place celebrated with its first live music, a jazz duo, Friday along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. The club had been closed since March 2020. Blumenthal called the club “iconic.” Toad’s opened in the 1970s and has been a hot spot for local bands but also has hosted acts such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, U2 and, more recently, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar. The club was awarded a $1 million grant through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program. Venues that lost at least 90% of their revenues during the pandemic are eligible. DeLauro said the federal government has received about 13,000 applications for aid from entertainment venues, and it appears there is enough money to provide support to those that qualify. Catherine Marx, Connecticut district director for the Small Business Administration, said grants had been prioritized for the venues that had been hardest-hit by the pandemic, and Toad’s is one of 10 Connecticut venues to receive funds so far, the New Haven Register reports. “We’ve missed our performing arts. We’ve missed going out,” Marx said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Lawmakers want to add protections in the state constitution for the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities. House Bill 199 by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, would add “sexual orientation,” “gender identity” and “disability” to the Delaware Constitution’s equal rights clause. The legislation would make the First State the first state in the U.S. to add these protections for LGBTQ people to its constitution, lawmakers said. In Delaware, constitutional amendments require lawmakers to pass one bill for two consecutive legislative sessions, which span two years. This bill would be the first of two, and the next one would not be voted on until 2023 at the earliest. Earlier this year, lawmakers amended the constitution to add anti-discrimination protections for people of color. In 2019, they amended it to prohibit discrimination based on sex. The new bill comes five years after lawmakers failed to agree on a similar, more inclusive proposal from then-Sen. Karen Peterson that would have added protections for race, sex and national origin, along with age, religion, creed, color, familial status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, several new Democratic lawmakers – including members of the LGBTQ community – have been elected to the Statehouse.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The fight for D.C. statehood continues this week at the U.S. Capitol as proponents prepare to make their case in front of a Senate committee, WUSA-TV reports. The hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is scheduled for Tuesday morning, according to a statement from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who said it will be only the second time ever the Senate has held a hearing on statehood for the nation’s capital. Many of the arguments at Tuesday’s hearing will likely echo those made at another hearing earlier this year. In March, Norton told a House committee that “Congress can no longer allow D.C. residents to be sidelined in the Democratic ... process.” For Norton and many other supporters, statehood for the district is a civil rights issue. “Denying American citizens a vote in the body that taxes them goes against the founding principles of this great nation,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at that same hearing. However, GOP opposition in the House was strong, with many Republicans calling the push for statehood a political power grab to tip the balance in Congress in Democrats’ favor.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Coast: A high school principal spent the last several months of the school year crafting personalized notes for each of 459 graduates and left them on their seats to read before receiving their diplomas. Matanzas High School principal Jeff Reaves scoured through transcripts, emails and his own personal memories to prepare the notes in time for the June 2 graduation. He wanted to do something special since the seniors’ last two years were marred by the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to be positive for our students, especially in a time where there’s a lot of negativity and turmoil in the world,” Reaves said. “I wanted to shine some light on the students and encourage them as they begin their next journey in life.” He said the process was especially beneficial to him because he got a chance to learn more about each student. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but it’s the names that really matter. I was doing my part to help them feel connected as a community and have their high school experience to be positive.” Reaves said he’s always tried to work in something special for each class, by recognizing certain students and through the songs played at commencements. Last June, seniors graduated at Daytona International Speedway, and the school put customized yard signs for each student on the football field.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The coastal county where Ahmaud Arbery’s slaying raised an outcry over racial injustice has hired its first full-time Black police chief. Glynn County commissioners voted Thursday for Jacques Battiste to lead an embattled department that some state lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to abolish last year. A former FBI agent now serving as a deputy constable in New Orleans, Battiste was chosen after a search conducted by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police with assistance from the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. “I promise you I will bring my best game every day,” Battiste told residents during a community forum last week. Battiste’s hiring comes after a turbulent year for the Glynn County Police Department. The agency was widely criticized for making no arrests after Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased and fatally shot by three white men who spotted him running in their neighborhood Feb. 23, 2020. Charges came more than two months later after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over. Days after Arbery’s killing, Glynn County Police Chief John Powell was indicted on unrelated malfeasance charges in what prosecutors called an illegal effort to cover up a narcotics officer’s affair with a confidential informant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHana: Some people who live in east Maui say the famed Road to Hana is becoming a gridlocked maze of illegally parked cars driven by tourists. Residents are asking for state and county help to address the traffic and parking problem, Hawaii News Now reports. Maui has seen an influx of visitors as pandemic restrictions have eased. The drive to Hana is among the most popular tourist activities on the island. Now that 8,000 visitors a day are arriving on Maui, the narrow, winding road is getting jammed. The coastal roadway brings visitors past waterfalls and sea cliffs along a rural and lush Hawaii rainforest. The remote shoreline’s residents are among the most geographically isolated in the state. Officials say 400 to 600 people drive the road each day. The state recently installed signs warning people of parking fines. But residents want a more comprehensive traffic plan. “We know our visitors are important to our economy. But there comes a time where you really start to look at the numbers,” said east Maui resident Kamalani Pahukoa, who often sees traffic jams and illegally parked rental cars. “That becomes a problem to our quality of life, traditions, culture and access.” Toll roads and reservation systems are among ideas being looked at, said Lauren Armstrong, the Maui Metropolitan Planning Organization’s executive director.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a plan for Boise government to be carbon neutral by 2035 and the entire city by 2050 to fight climate change. The Boise City Council voted unanimously last week to approve the Climate Action Roadmap. The plan includes a goal for government to use only clean electricity by 2030. Carbon neutrality means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero.” The goal is to reduce carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas warming the atmosphere. “Tonight is truly a historic moment for our city,” Mayor Lauren McLean said after the vote. “We’re the generation that must solve the climate crisis because our health and economy depend on us doing this now. Boise will be a climate innovation leader, and we will rise to the challenge of this moment.” The capital city has about 225,000 residents. Benefits of the plan include improving human health and growing a climate-friendly economy, officials said. Ways for the city to meet carbon neutrality include such things as switching to electric vehicles or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees that store carbon. The plan also calls for using less energy, traveling less and reducing waste. “It is a detailed plan with attainable goals,” Councilman Patrick Bageant said. “It’s not just a declaration of a wish list; it’s an actual plan that we will begin to execute.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s primary election will be moved from March to June next year under a voter access expansion signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The new law makes mail voting a permanent option, allows jail inmates awaiting trial to cast ballots and makes Election Day in November a state holiday, among other things. The move is in contrast with other states that are moving to restrict voter access. “With attacks on voting rights on the rise in states across the nation, Illinois is proud to stand up for a strong, secure, and accessible democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement Thursday. The law took effect immediately. Next year’s primary will move from March 15 to June 28 because lawmakers decided not to draw new post-census district boundaries for members of Congress until official 2020 census figures, delayed by the pandemic, arrive later this summer. Many changes continue or expand existing practices put in place last year to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Election Day would continue to be a state holiday, with empty schools used as polling places. Also, Illinois counties would be required to establish at least one universal voting center to give voters alternatives sites.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man who threatened his neighbor with anti-Black racial slurs, displayed a swastika and threw eggs in an attempt to intimidate the neighbor has been sentenced to 46 months in prison and three years supervised release for criminal violations of the Fair Housing Act and unlawful possession of firearms. Shepherd Hoehn, 51, pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year. Among other racist actions, Hoehn burned a cross above the fence line facing his neighbor’s property and repeatedly played Confederate-era minstrel anthem “Dixie.” The intimidation began when Hoehn became angry as a construction crew began to remove a tree from the neighbor’s property, according to court documents. “Today, Mr. Hoehn was held responsible for his vile conduct,” Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBI Indianapolis Division said in a press release Friday. The case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Lawrence Police Department. “We are a diverse nation, bound together by shared values and beliefs,” Keenan said. “We are also a nation of laws. Those like Mr. Hoehn who would betray our shared values and beliefs through behavior such as this rightly suffer the penalties our laws prescribe.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A sharply divided Iowa Supreme Court on Friday stopped a lawsuit aimed at reducing the flow of fertilizer and hog farm waste into the state’s river and streams, finding that limiting pollution from farms was a political matter and not one for the courts. The 4-3 decision handed a significant defeat to environmental groups hoping to get the chance to prove that Iowa should scrap its voluntary farm pollution policy, order new mandatory limits on nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, and stop construction of new hog barns. It is the latest court rejection of an attempt to force the nation’s leading corn- and pork-producing state to clean up farm pollutants from its major rivers that provide drinking water to hundreds of thousands of Iowans. The lawsuit, which was brought by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Food & Water Watch, contended that unregulated farm pollution is violating the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River for recreational and drinking water use. It said a legal concept that precedes Iowa statehood – the public trust doctrine – should apply to this case and require the state to ensure that citizens have a usable Raccoon River untainted by excess pollution caused by farm runoff of fertilizer and animal manure.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A team of archaeologists – Jay Sturdevant, Adam Wiewel, Nikki Klarmann and Robert Hoard – recently spent two days in the city laying the groundwork for an excavation project to take place next summer at the Brown v. Board National Historic Site. The Kansas Archeology Training Program field school will be held June 3-19, 2022. The public is welcome to help excavate land archaeologists believe will yield artifacts and the foundations of demolished buildings. Klarmann, public outreach archaeologist for the Kansas Historical Society, said the field school is an opportunity to get a taste of archaeology. “A lot of people think maybe it’s just going out, digging and collecting, but there’s a lot more to it than that. They get experience in the field excavating but also in the lab analyzing artifacts,” Klarmann said. The field school is open to anyone over age 12. Registration will open March 1, 2022, with a registration fee of $15-$90. Klarmann said most participants are people who are curious and don’t have an archaeology background. “Really it’s just people who are interested in history and learning more about their state,” Klarmann said. “We also have people who come from California to do this, and they’ve been coming for years.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Thousands of Kentuckians can now apply for a waiver that could clear them from having to repay the overpayments included in their unemployment benefits. The Kentucky Office of Unemployment Insurance says it has mailed notices to about 14,000 unemployment claimants identified as having been overpaid in 2020. The notices inform claimants how much they were overpaid and provide instructions on how to apply for the waiver, either online or by completing an enclosed form, the state agency said. Claimants have 30 days from the date postmarked on the letter to apply for the waiver and must attest that the overpayment was the result of no fault of their own, the agency said. Legislation allowing the state to waive the overpayment of some pandemic-related unemployment claims was passed by lawmakers this year and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear. The state has paid out more than $6 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, Beshear’s administration said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAvery Island: As storms grow more violent and Louisiana loses more of its coast, the family that makes Tabasco Sauce is fighting erosion in the marshland that buffers its factory from hurricanes and floods. Overall, the effort is probably a standoff, said CEO and President Harold “Took” Osborn, great-great-grandson of the McIlhenny Co.’s founder. But in a state that has lost 2,000 square miles of its coast since 1932, holding ground is a victory. The company has been brewing Tabasco Sauce since 1868 on Avery Island, the tip of a miles-deep column of salt. While sinking land is a problem throughout southern Louisiana, Avery Island and four smaller salt domes along the Gulf Coast are still slowly rising. But the danger from hurricanes remains. A 20-foot-high, $5 million earthen levee now encloses the 40 acres or so around Tabasco’s factory after Hurricane Rita’s storm surge pushed floodwaters within inches of it in 2005. Much of the wetlands work is low-tech, enlisting volunteers to plant marsh grass in the 30,000 acres around the island. Osborn holds a master’s degree in environmental science from Oxford University, and company founder Edmund McIlhenny was a self-taught naturalist. Osborn’s great-grandfather, E.A. McIlhenny, created an egret rookery at the island in 1895 because the birds were nearing extermination by hunters who sold their plumage to adorn women’s hats.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A statewide ban on single-use plastic bags will begin July 1. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said it is working with retail stores and restaurants to make sure they are ready. The Legislature passed the ban in 2019, and it was initially scheduled to go into effect in April 2020. The state delayed enforcement of the ban because of aspects of the coronavirus pandemic. The first delay was due to concerns about the transmission of the virus and a second delay due to concerns stemming from disruption in packing supplies amid the pandemic, the DEP said. When the ban takes effect, stores and restaurants will not be allowed to provide single-use plastic bags, the DEP said. Grocery stores, box stores and other large retailers must collect a 5 cent fee for each such bag used, the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Replacing Amtrak’s Baltimore & Potomac Tunnel will take a least a decade or more to complete. But the $4 billion rail project has officially begun, and officials say it will eliminate the biggest passenger rail bottleneck between Washington and New Jersey. The Baltimore Sun reports officials kicked off the project’s start at an event Friday that included the great-great-granddaughter of Frederick Douglass. The tunnel will be renamed after the famed abolitionist. Douglass had escaped the bonds of slavery on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and eventually boarded a New York-bound train from Baltimore in 1838. “If it had not been for the railroad,” Nettie Washington Douglass told the Sun in an interview, “I would not be standing here.” Jeffrey Ensor, Amtrak’s senior director for the south end of the Northeast Corridor, said the new tunnel will increase train speeds to more than 100 mph from 30 mph. Construction will be funded by the federal and state government because the tunnel is used by Amtrak and MARC passengers. Negotiations are underway to determine how much each government will contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: In a move likely to strike a chord with music fans, the Boston Symphony Orchestra has announced plans to reopen Symphony Hall and resume in-person performances for a complete season starting in September. The BSO will open the 2021-22 season Sept. 30 – after an 18-month live-audience performance hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic – with Music Director Andris Nelsons sharing the podium with Boston Pops Conductor Laureate John Williams for a program featuring soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The program will feature Beethoven’s Consecration of the House Overture, the work that opened the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 1881. The reopening concert will also feature the Boston premiere of a new work by Williams, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra. The season that runs until next April also features a new cycle of six major works by Richard Strauss; a performance cycle of five Beethoven concertos with soloist Mitsuko Uchida; orchestra works of Berlioz, Brahms, Ives, Mahler, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Still and Stravinsky; and world premieres by Julia Adolphe, HK Gruber, and Kaija Saariaho and American premieres by Unsuk Chin and Jorg Widmann. To celebrate the reopening of Symphony Hall, the BSO will also present a free community concert Oct. 3 featuring Nelsons, Williams, Keith Lockhart and Thomas Wilkins.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Organizers of a popular festival that was shut down last year due to the pandemic are encouraging people attending this summer to receive free COVID-19 vaccinations on-site. Masks will not be required at the 95th National Cherry Festival, scheduled July 3-10 at Traverse City’s Open Space Park, according to MLive.com. The Grand Traverse Health Department will offer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a tent at the park. Michigan lifted all indoor capacity restrictions and mask requirements Monday as the state’s vaccination rate increases and the numbers of COVID-19 infections continue to decrease. “With the impossibility of knowing when restrictions would be lifted or changed, we had to start planning in January to provide Traverse City with a safe, family-friendly event that allowed everyone to participate no matter how ready they are to fully enter back into ‘normal’ life,” said Kat Paye, festival executive director. The festival, a major northern Michigan summer destination for decades, typically offers parades, fireworks, concerts, farm tours, a carnival midway and cherry pie-eating contests. Many event spaces will be reconfigured this year. Some activities will be presented in new ways, such as the festival parade being stationary instead of participants marching along a parade route.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A new student group in the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry aims to continue the effort to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in the school. Better Together hosted its first event May 25, exactly one year after George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. Arpun Johal, a third-year student and one of the group’s founding members, said Floyd’s murder prompted the group’s formation, The Minnesota Daily reports. “Last year, I feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the U.S.,” Johal said. “From that, we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement.” The group’s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, anti-Asian racism, the experiences of Asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to Asian students and patients. Zayna Jan, another third-year student and founding member of Better Together, created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize. “I wanted (the toolkit) to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly – and for it to be dental school-specific,” Jan said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The more than 1,500 Mississippi National Guard members who have been working throughout the state over the course of the coronavirus pandemic to help with virus testing, vaccinations and other initiatives are being withdrawn next month, Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday. The state will cease all operations with the Mississippi National Guard on July 15, Reeves said. The Republican governor also announced that he will lift the COVID-19 state of emergency order Aug. 15. While all pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted, the state of emergency order has remained in place to ensure that members of the National Guard continue to be paid while stationed in Mississippi. Guard members have been serving in Mississippi since March 2020, stationed at dozens of state-run vaccination and testing sites. Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard Maj. Gen. Janson D. Boyles said Friday that the governor’s timeline to lift Mississippi’s state of emergency declaration ensures his service members will “complete all necessary out-processing requirements and receive the benefits and entitlements they have earned during their dedicated service to our state.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Summer classes have moved online for some elementary and middle school students because of COVID-19 cases. The St. Joseph News-Press reports Robidoux and Pershing schools will conduct classes virtually through July 1, when summer school ends. Only about 1 in 5 eligible residents, or 20.6%, have received a COVID-19 vaccine in Buchanan County, where St. Joseph is located. That’s below the still-low statewide average of 37%. The vaccine is generally available to all people 12 and older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any vaccine for those under age 12, which has been a cause for increased precautions regarding COVID-19 in an elementary school environment. “We just took a precautionary measure,” said Gabe Edgar, the district’s assistant superintendent, adding that because the district has a remote learning system in place, it “really doesn’t make sense to leave those kids in there, potentially at risk.” She said all other summer school locations will remain in person. Summer sessions already were being conducted online only for high school students.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park says it’s seeing more visitors showing up early in the morning and evening when the park’s new ticketed entry system is not in effect. Glacier administrators say people who arrive at the park’s West entrance after 5 p.m. should expect heavy traffic and long waits. The park in northwestern Montana on the Canada border had almost 300,000 visits through May. That’s the highest year-to-date number on record. To ease congestion on the popular Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier this year began requiring visitors to obtain an entry ticket and reservation prior to arrival. About a quarter of Memorial Day weekend visitors arrived without a reservation at the park’s West and St. Mary entrances.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Work has begun on nearly $30 million in renovation projects that will change the entrance to Omaha’s Eppley Airfield and upgrade one of the national airport’s garages. The entrance to the airport terminal will be moved about a quarter-mile south, toward downtown along Abbott Drive, the Omaha World-Herald reports, under a project estimated at $20.8 million. The change comes following several studies in recent years showing the need for a longer, wider entrance that will give drivers more time to make maneuvering decisions. The $8.3 million in improvements to the airport’s south garage will include construction of an express ramp to provide access to premier parking and provide wider parking stalls. Both projects include new signs, lights and landscaping. Construction began Wednesday and is slated to be finished by late 2022. Both the terminal and south garage will be open during construction, although drivers may encounter occasional minor detours or closures. Most of the funding for the projects will come from Omaha Airport Authority revenues, but the terminal entrance project is getting a $12 million boost in grants from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a second year of intense drought, the Nevada Department of Wildlife’s water developments – the only source of water for miles for desert bighorn sheep – have hit perilously low storage levels in Valley of Fire State Park. Without the agency’s emergency intervention, animal populations will decline, and ecosystem viability is threatened. “We’ve had drought conditions before. We have had to haul water on an emergency basis, but not anywhere near approaching this magnitude, this scale of severity,” Wildlife Game Biologist Pat Cummings told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I have been in Southern Nevada since the mid-’70s. I remember 2001 and 2002 as being the worst, back-to-back dry years, even worse than 1996. But what we see now is even worse, even worse.” Last year, Las Vegas went 240 days without measurable rainfall. This year, 40% of the state is in exceptional drought, the highest level, according to the National Weather Service. “All animals, especially bighorn sheep, which have evolved to coexist with the desert environment, rely a lot on the vegetation for water,” Southern Region Game Supervisor Joe Bennett said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Disciplinary hearings for police officers accused of misconduct serious enough for decertification should not be automatically held behind closed doors, a judge ruled. The judge’s decision came as the Legislature voted to make disciplinary proceedings public. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu told New Hampshire Public Radio that the governor supports the bill. The Union Leader newspaper sued over the disciplinary proceedings of a detective and an officer in Manchester, arguing that the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council’s practice of shielding hearings and certain records from public view, if requested by the officer, was a violation of the state’s Right to Know law. Judge Andrew Schulman agreed that the council should no longer automatically exempt the public from reading materials or viewing disciplinary proceedings. However, the order does not create a blanket requirement that all disciplinary proceedings be made public. The attorney general’s office is still reviewing the decision and hasn’t said if it will appeal.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: In a state where medical marijuana is often more expensive than flying elsewhere and buying it there, patients registered with some financial assistance programs could see their weed costs covered. The cost of New Jersey medical marijuana, among the highest of any state in the country, would be covered for patients enrolled in four different financial assistance programs meant to help children, seniors, crime victims and those with disabilities, under identical bills already approved by the Senate and Assembly health committees. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, could see votes as soon as this week. Under the legislation, patients enrolled in these programs could only have to pay a small copay for medical marijuana or have their costs covered: the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled, the Senior Gold Prescription Discount and the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. “The cost of cannabis can run into the hundreds of dollars per month for individuals,” Conaway said. “This bill serves those who are financially distressed and ... ensures the benefits of medical cannabis are available to all who may need it.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state ranked 49th in a report released Monday measuring child well-being based on data gathered before the pandemic. That’s an improvement over last year, when New Mexico ranked 50th among U.S. states. “It’s encouraging to see that child well-being in New Mexico was improving before the pandemic hit,” said James Jimenez, executive director for New Mexico Voices for Children, which partners with the foundation. He said he’s cautiously optimistic that state policies “helped offset some of the health and financial problems caused by the pandemic.” The annual Kids Count report released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation tracks 16 metrics of children’s access to education, health, economic and social stability at home. It ranks New Mexico at or near the bottom on education, economics, and “family and community,” which tracks rates of single-parent homes, teen birth rates and whether the head of household has a high school degree. Roughly 1 in 5 New Mexico children lives in an area where 30% of the population is at or below the federal poverty line. Nationally, only 1 in 10 children lives in a high-poverty area, according to the report. The report ranks the state 37th in child health, with kids having average access to insurance (94%) and only slightly higher-than-average obesity (32%).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Stonewall Inn’s owners say they won’t serve certain beers at the famous LGBT bar during Pride weekend to protest manufacturer Anheuser-Busch’s political contributions to some politicians who have supported anti-LGBT legislation. Co-owners Stacy Lentz and Kurt Kelly said they would be instituting the ban Friday in support of the “Keep Your Pride” campaign, a recently launched effort highlighting five companies that it says advertise support during Pride but have also made contributions to anti-LGBT lawmakers. The campaign, a project of Corporate Accountability Action, used data compiled from the National Institute on Money in Politics to show that Anheuser-Busch contributed more than $35,000 to 29 legislators it described as anti-LGBT between 2015 and 2020. “We just felt Stonewall having the platform, the power to do this, it was important to stand up,” Lentz said. “We really just want Anheuser-Busch to stop donating to lawmakers who are trying to legalize discrimination.” In a statement, Anheuser-Busch said: “We support candidates for public office whose policy positions and objectives support investments in our communities, job creation, and industry growth.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A museum criticized for a planned reenactment of a white slave owner being pursued by Union soldiers says its doors will be closed until further notice, a local department said. The Mecklenburg Park and Recreation Department announced Thursday that the Historic Latta Plantation is closed and that all previously scheduled events are canceled while the department assesses the future use of the county-owned property, the agency said on its website. The house and the grounds also will be closed, the department said. The 19th-century house is owned by Mecklenburg County, while a nonprofit operates the facilities and runs the events at the plantation site. Last Tuesday, Mecklenburg County announced it would let its contract with the museum expire next month over the controversial event that many deemed as racially insensitive. The reenactment was scheduled for June 19, the traditional commemoration date of the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. known as Juneteenth. On Thursday, President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Officials say wildfires have burned about 156 square miles of land across the drought-stricken state so far this year – more than seven times the amount from all of last year. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services and North Dakota Forest Service report that nearly 1,400 fires have been confirmed in 2021. A total of 921 fires recorded last year burned less than 20 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months in 127 years of recordkeeping, according to State Forester Tom Claeys. Limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year, the Minot Daily News reports. Several local, tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires over the April 30-May 2 weekend. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland, north of Medora, burned more than 7 square miles, while another fire on the Fort Berthold Reservation, about 6 miles south of Mandaree, burned more than 15 square miles. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said, noting that the Fourth of July is “right around the corner.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Just like saving treats for furry friends waiting under the dining room table, utility company AEP Ohio will now donate its leftovers to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Trimmings from trees and shrubs pruned throughout the Columbus area to keep electric power lines clear will soon be used to feed giraffes, beavers and a variety of animals at the zoo and the safari park near Cumberland. Through a new partnership called “Trim to Treat,” AEP Ohio will deliver those leftovers to the zoo twice a week. Those trimmings will then be sorted through to determine what should be used to feed the animals. “We’re just really thankful,” said Jan Ramer, interim senior vice president for animal care and conservation at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Ramer said browse – the ecological term for tree trimmings – is good for the animals’ physical and mental health alike. It provides them with fiber needed to aid in their digestion, but it also provides the feeling of being in nature as opposed to captivity. Before the AEP Ohio partnership, Ramer said horticulturalists at the zoo would cut browse from trees and shrubs on its grounds. While that process won’t end with the formation of the partnership, Ramer said AEP’s contributions will supplement and support the zoo’s browse supply.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, which pioneered the use of electronic passes 30 years ago, is preparing to take a long-awaited first step toward cashless tolls but has yet to comply with a 2016 deadline to integrate the PikePass system with tolling authorities across the country. When introduced, the PikePass system was hailed as a way to reduce crashes that occurred at toll booths with drivers stopping and slowing down as well as a cost savings for the trucking industry. The turnpike authority reports 2,093,460 vehicles are tagged with PikePasses that stick to the top of a windshield and record when drivers enter and exit toll roads in Oklahoma. Toll booths, however, are still operated on the state’s 11 turnpikes, and traffic backups still occur at toll plazas along busy corridors like the Will Rogers, Turner and Kilpatrick turnpikes. Later this summer, the Kilpatrick Turnpike will be the first to be switched to cashless tolls in which drivers without PikePasses will be billed by mail. “We continue to have accidents at cash lanes, so the impact of this is enormous,” said spokesman Jack Damrill. “It will not just help with safety; it with help with the environment also.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities in Lake Oswego and Tigard are among communities asking residents to reduce water use during a chlorine shortage. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports water treatment facilities use the chemical in small amounts to prevent harmful bacteria growth in drinking water supply. State officials say they have a plan to help water districts get the chlorine they need if their stockpiles run low, and there’s no threat to the water on which the public depends. The shortage occurred after a power outage earlier this month at the Westlake chemical facility in Longview, Washington, the main provider of chlorine for Oregon. Matt Marheine, deputy director at the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, said the shortage is not unique to Oregon, and “the drinking water in the state of Oregon is clean and safe to use and drink.” The concern is how long the current chlorine supply will last. Most Oregon water districts have about a month’s supply of chlorine, according to Andre Ourso, administrator for the Oregon Health Authorities’ Center for Health Protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: The remains of 10 more Native American children who died more than a century ago at a boarding school in central Pennsylvania are being disinterred and will be returned to their relatives, authorities said. A team of archaeologists began work Saturday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, which also houses the U.S. Army War College. Nine of the children were from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota and one from the Alaskan Aleut tribe. The cemetery contains more than 180 graves of students who attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School – a government-run boarding school for Native American children. This is the Army’s fourth disinterment project at the school in as many years. The school founded by an Army officer opened in 1879 and housed some 10,000 Indigenous children before it shut down in 1918. Students were forced to cut their braids, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. Infectious disease and harsh conditions claimed the lives of many of the children buried there. The Army is fully funding the cost of the project – about $500,000 per year, including travel to the transfer ceremony as well as transport and reburial of the deceased children, said Barbara Lewandrowski of the Office of Army Cemeteries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles said he had no idea that a sex business was allegedly operating in a building he owns. Cranston police raided the building owned by Walter “Bud” Craddock through his real estate holdings company following a months­long investigation into six properties where investigators suspect prostitution was taking police, according to a police affidavit. Craddock told WPRI-TV he knew there was a business but didn’t know about any illegal activities. “I personally had never gotten any complaints, otherwise this would have been rectified a long time ago,” Craddock said. “If I was aware of the things that were alleged to be going on there, the lease would have been terminated.” The 3,200-square-foot property is one of several owned by Craddock’s LUC Realty and was subject of a raid in 2017 “for the same activity, prostitution and massage without a license,” Cranston Police Chief Col. Michael Winquist told WPRI in an email. All six massage businesses that were raided were shut down, 11 people were arrested, and police are investigating whether women were working against their will, Winquist said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Beach towns are ticketing more people for public drinking as summer visitors flock to the coast. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports open container citations on Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island have risen above their pre-pandemic levels. On Folly Beach, not a single person received an open container ticket in the weeks leading up to Memorial Day in 2019. This year, officers handed out seven citations between the end of April and May 23. On Sullivan’s Island, beach officers wrote 180 open container tickets ahead of Memorial Day, a 120% increase from tickets in the same period in 2019. Town officials say the alcohol violations might be related to people enjoying their lives as vaccinations have emboldened some and helped keep many COVID-19 cases at bay. Sullivan’s Island Town Administrator Andy Benke said open container tickets usually pick up after Memorial Day because the beach service officers, who are Citadel cadets this year, get better at ticketing – and less reluctant to punish beachgoers having a good time – over the summer. “If you’ve driven that far to spend the day at the beach, maybe you’re more inclined to roll the dice and take a chance,” Benke told the newspaper. “But Sullivan’s Island and Folly and Isle of Palms don’t allow alcohol on the beach. That’s just the way it is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An abandoned gypsum mine in Black Hawk that was exposed by a sinkhole in 2020 may extend farther than current mapped areas show, according to a geophysical study. Mohammad Sadeghi, a professor of geological engineering at Montana Technical University who led the study, said there’s a possibility that the mine extends below Interstate 90. The study recommends further research be done in the area. More than 40 people from 15 homes in the Hideaway Hills neighborhood were forced to evacuate after the collapse in April 2020 in Black Hawk, about 8 miles northwest of Rapid City. At least two lawsuits have been filed in relation to the collapse, one of which is one step closer to class-action status, the Rapid City Journal reports. The Fitzgerald Law firm of Rapid City filed a lawsuit against developers and county and state entities. Fox Rothschild, a large national law firm, filed one against state government. Hideaway Hills residents are also seeking answers to a potential loss of sewage service due to the mine. Sadeghi has presented his team’s research methods to Hideaway Hills residents and said he believed the sinkhole opened due to surface water infiltrating the ground and seeping into the roof of the mine that dissolved gypsum.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Correction announced it is participating in a service that provides the public with criminal case information and custody status of inmates. The Victim Information and Notification Everyday service will be used in conjunction with TDOC’s current victim notification system. That system already provides written notice of offenders’ location, transfer, sentence expiration, release and parole hearings. The VINE system will allow crime victims to have more control over the type of notifications they receive and choose the method by which they are notified, according to the Correction Department. Anyone wishing to receive updates can sign up at VINELink.com. Live operators are also available to provide support at 888-868-4631.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Families who opted for remote learning last school year will have to return to in-person classrooms when the next semester begins Aug.17. The Austin school district announced Friday that it plans to return all students to campus and will not offer a remote learning option for the 2021-22 school year. Austin joins the Round Rock, Lake Travis, Leander, Eanes and Hays school districts in announcing the return to on-campus-only learning. The Austin district cited low COVID-19 case numbers as well as the Legislature’s failure to pass a bill that would have authorized local public schools to count students in remote learning programs as part of their enrollment. School districts are funded based on their daily enrollment numbers. The bill became a casualty of House Democrats’ walkout to kill a Republican voting bill ahead of a midnight deadline last month. Austin and 29 other school districts around the state sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday asking him to take up this legislation in the special session he has promised to call this summer to focus on overhauling the state’s voting laws.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A local public health expert says an increase in opioid abuse amid the coronavirus pandemic was recorded throughout the state. Gabriela Murza, who leads Utah State University Extension’s HEART initiative in Utah County, presented data to the Utah County Commission during a work session last week while discussing the state-funded program, which “brings academic resources into the community, partnering locally and nationally to address the opioid epidemic and other pressing public health issues,” the Daily Herald reports. According to Murza, the program operates in nine counties, including Utah County, “where opioid use disorder has had some of the most devastating effects as far as overdose and deaths related to opioid use.” Other counties served by the program include Salt Lake, Davis, Tooele and Box Elder. Murza told the commissioners that the rate of opioid use disorder has “leveled off” in recent years, and “the trend seems to be getting a little bit better in Utah.” But “then 2020 hit, and everywhere the numbers went up, they did increase as far as deaths due to opioids,” the public health professor said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An innovative health care program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs missed its financial target between 2017 and 2019, a new report by the Vermont state auditor has found. The report released Monday by State Auditor Douglas Hoffer said that OneCare Vermont, the organization set up to run the program, missed its Medicaid financial targets over the three years by $11.1 million. And the state paid $14.5 million for OneCare’s operating costs to reach a total of $25.6 million total. Hoffer said the financial costs to run the program exceeded any Medicaid savings attributed to it. The goal of what’s known as the all-payer model is to keep patients healthier while reducing health care costs by paying a set amount of money for each covered patient rather than paying for each service provided. “I anticipate the people implementing the All-Payer Model will say the scale and complexity of the reform initiative merit patience before reaching conclusions, and that is reasonable … to a point,” Hoffer said in a statement. OneCare CEO Vicki Loner said she disagreed with the conclusions of Hoffer’s report, and the organization is proud of the work it is doing “tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s “dangerously” full mental hospitals are overwhelmed amid staffing shortages, a situation that has long plagued the hospitals and only worsened during the pandemic, according to state officials. But The Washington Post reports lawmakers and policy experts hope pandemic relief funds can help bring about systematic changes that free inpatient beds and develop community services to keep people out of hospitals in the first place. When the General Assembly reconvenes in August, it will decide how to spend about $4 billion Virginia is getting from a pandemic relief package earlier this year. A joint subcommittee studying mental health services is preparing recommendations for how to use the funds in time for the session. “We have the opportunity with these funds to really do something transformational. That is what we are asking for,” Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services Commissioner Alison Land said in a presentation to the subcommittee this month. The state’s nine inpatient psychiatric hospitals, which have a total of 2,124 beds, are operating at an average 98% capacity, she said. And efforts to contain the coronavirus have had unintended consequences.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A federal judge has issued a summary judgment in favor of the state against two gold mining companies over years of water pollution stemming from the Buckhorn Mountain gold mine in Okanogan County. U.S. District Court Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson on Thursday dismissed the companies’ main defenses, writing there was no support for their claims that the state attorney general cannot enforce all of the mine’s Clean Water Act permit. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Bob Ferguson contended that Crown Resources and Kinross Gold violated the law by discharging illegal levels of pollutants into creeks in Okanogan County flowing into the Kettle River. Now the focus shifts to how much the companies will owe for the violations. They potentially face millions of dollars in penalties for their pollution, and the judge will decide how much. “Crown and Kinross knew even before the mine’s construction that it could release significant contamination, including arsenic and chloride, into surrounding waters, yet plowed ahead anyway,” Ferguson said. “Washington takes our water quality seriously.” Crown Resources and its parent company, Kinross Gold, extracted approximately $1.3 billion in gold from the mine from 2008 to 2017.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new campaign is encouraging residents to support small businesses as the economy continues to reopen. The West Virginia Small Business Development Center launched its “Come In, We’re Open” campaign Sunday. It’s an invitation to people to visit local businesses in their communities, center Director Debra Martin told The Exponent Telegram. “Throughout the pandemic, small-business owners have adapted and persevered and continue to be the backbone of our economy. As West Virginia reopens, it’s critical that small businesses receive enough support to survive long term,” she said. Business owners around the state can get involved by displaying a “Come In, We’re Open” sign and posting to social media with “#WeAreOpenWV.” The campaign will last through September, officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Superintendents, school board members and other education leaders on Monday demanded that Republican lawmakers devote more state aid to schools. Superintendents and other school officials have been criticizing the amount of state aid for education that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled finance committee inserted in the state budget proposal last week. The full Legislature is expected to pass the budget, which would run from this July through mid-2023, as soon as next week. School leaders predicted that without more state funding, they might have to hold staff salaries flat or cut liberal arts classes. “All students and staff across our state deserve better than zero,” Verona Area School District Superintendent Tremayne Clardy said outside the state Capitol. “This budget simply does not meet the needs of students and families across the state.” Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed giving K-12 schools $1.6 billion over the next two years. Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee scrapped that plan and instead allocated $128 million – about $400 million less than they needed to allocate to ensure the state’s schools would get about $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: With 80% of adults over 18 fully vaccinated in Teton County, health officials are launching an innovative effort to further increase the community’s protection from COVID-19. “The whole goal is to try to get to the people, to make it easier for people,” Public Health Response Coordinator Rachael Wheeler said. The Health Department’s new “Vaxi Taxi,” a repurposed START bus turned mobile vaccine clinic, aims to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines by reaching outlying populations that are unable to get their shots at the health department in town. “Having a more mobile unit where we can easily set up inside that unit becomes really convenient for us,” Wheeler said. Nurses check in patients under a tent outside the bus and ask patients about any potential COVID-19 symptoms or recent contact with infected individuals. Nurses also patiently describe side effects they might experience after the vaccine, usually a sore arm and mild fever, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Patients then head onto the Vaxi Taxi, where they receive their shots in the seats passengers have generally used for transportation. The Vaxi Taxi sports two tables that can be set up and put away with ease, seats for vaccine recipients, medical forms and equipment for vaccine distribution, and a team of friendly professionals.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/07/31/beyond-prague-experience-czech-republics-castles-rick-steves/1867301001/", "title": "Prague and beyond: Experience the Czech Republic's castles and ...", "text": "Rick Steves\n\nFew cities can match Prague's over-the-top romance, evocative Old World charm — or its tourist crowds.\n\nTo escape the masses and experience more of the real Czech Republic, take a bus or train ride outside of the city to see some of the many worthwhile sights just beyond. My three favorites are a rich medieval town, a sobering concentration camp memorial, and a grand Czech castle.\n\nKutná Hora, a beautifully preserved and down-to-earth town, is just a one-hour direct train ride from Prague. With a current population of just 20,000, it can hardly be categorized as a \"second city\" to Prague, but it was considered the second city of Bohemia in the 17th century. Kutná Hora sits on top of what was once the world's largest silver mine and, in its heyday, much of Europe's standard coinage was minted here. At the town's Czech Museum of Silver, you can join a tour and spelunk in the former miners' passages that run beneath the town center.\n\nIn addition to financing much of Prague's grand architecture, the glittering silver deposits also paid for Kutná Hora's opulent Gothic cathedral, St. Barbara's, dedicated to the patron saint of mining. Its dazzling interior celebrates the town's sources of wealth, with frescoes featuring mining and minting.\n\nKutná Hora's most popular sight is actually on its outskirts, in the suburb of Sedlec: the evocative and offbeat bone church, within a serene graveyard. Unassuming from the outside, the 16th-century Sedlec Ossuary is filled with the bones of 40,000 people.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe raw material inside was provided by 14th-century plagues and 15th-century wars. Its chandelier supposedly includes at least one of every bone in the human body. Neat, 20-foot-tall pyramids decorate the walls and ceilings, and giant chalices made of bones flank the stairwell.\n\nTo explore more of the Czech Republic's history, specifically how the Czechs were affected by the Nazi regime, a one-hour bus ride from Prague takes you to the walled town of Terezín. Built in the 1780s with state-of-the-art, star-shaped walls designed to keep out the Prussians, it became a horribly overcrowded Jewish ghetto under Hitler.\n\nIronically, the town's medieval walls, originally meant to keep Germans out, were later used by Germans to keep the Jews in.\n\nThe various museums, memorials and points of interest of the Terezín experience are spread over a large area in two distinct parts: the walled town, which today feels like a workaday, if unusually tidy, Czech town, with a tight grid plan hemmed in by its stout walls; and (a half-mile walk east, across the river) the Small Fortress, which had been a Gestapo prison camp for political prisoners of all stripes (including non-Jewish Czechs).\n\nHere, in a supposedly \"self-governed Jewish resettlement area,\" Jewish culture seemed to thrive, as \"citizens\" put on plays and concerts, published a magazine and raised their families.\n\nBut it was all a carefully planned deception. As the Nazis' model \"Jewish town\" for deceiving Red Cross inspectors, Terezín fostered the illusion that its Jewish inmates lived relatively normal lives — making the sinister truth all the more cruel.\n\nWhen I explore memorials such as this one, I always ponder the message \"Forgive, but never forget.\"\n\nOther day-trip opportunities from Prague include several castles. The Neo-Gothic Konopiště Castle, 30 miles south of Prague, has some captivating stories to tell about its former inhabitants, including Archduke Franz Ferdinand — the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose assassination sparked World War I.\n\nInside Konopiště are halls upon halls of hunting trophies, paintings of royal relatives and photographs of Franz Ferdinand and family's travels. More importantly, the castle stands as a reminder of what his assassination (chillingly illustrated by items displayed inside the castle) meant for Europe — the end of the age of hereditary, divine-right empires and the dawn of Europe as a collection of nationalistic, democratic nation-states.\n\nHistorians get goose bumps at Konopiště, where if you listen closely, you can almost hear the last gasp of Europe's absolute monarchs.\n\nYou can see Franz Ferdinand's dressing room (with his actual uniform and his travel case all packed up and ready to go), his private study (which feels like he just stepped away from his desk for a cup of coffee), and — in the final room — a glass display case containing the dress his wife Žofie was wearing when she was also shot that fateful day in Sarajevo. Down the hall are the royal couple's death masks, Franz Ferdinand's bloody suspenders and the very bullet that ended Žofie's life.\n\nAbout 90% of tourists who visit the Czech Republic see only Prague. But if you venture outside the capital, the country offers a little of everything for the traveler.\n\nTraditional towns and villages? Check. A friendly and gentle countryside? Check. Grand castles?

More than 71,000 people have been arrested – about 7% of the country’s male population aged 14-29, according to The Economist. “Anyone suspected of ties to a criminal gang can be thrown into a crowded jail indefinitely”, with little evidence or due process.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But human rights groups say that thousands of innocent people have been wrongly imprisoned, and have raised concerns over torture, forced disappearances and Bukele’s increasingly authoritarian grip on power.\n\nWhat is the background?\n\nThe crackdown was “prompted by a bloody killing spree by gangs” in March last year, said CNN, in which 92 people died. On 27 March, there were 62 murders in a single day, “the deadliest day on record since the country’s civil war ended”, said The New York Times. The notorious Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang was blamed.\n\nBukele asked the Legislative Assembly (in which his party, Nuevas Ideas, has held a two-thirds majority since 2021), to declare a 30-day state of emergency. This suspended various constitutional rights, even allowing prosecutors to jail children aged 12 and above. It has been repeatedly extended ever since.\n\nAccording to a joint report by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organisation and Cristosal (a Salvadoran rights group) in December, the state of emergency has allowed widespread human-rights violations, including torture, forced disappearances and deaths in custody, the circumstances of which “suggest state responsibility”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe campaign of “mass, indiscriminate arrests” has led to the detention of hundreds of people “with no apparent connections to gangs’ abusive activity”, said HRW, often for long periods of time in harsh conditions and without trial.\n\nBukele “glories in brutality”, said The Economist, “tweeting photos of suspects cuffed, half-naked and packed tighter than battery hens”.\n\nLast month, justice minister Gustavo Villatoro said he would allow up to 900 people to be prosecuted at the same time. These “Kafkaesque trials”, said El Pais, “would undermine access to justice for victims of gang violence, hinder the release of innocent people, and violate due process guarantees”.\n\nHas it worked?\n\nEl Salvador’s homicide rate has fallen from a peak of 106 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015, to 7.8 in 2022, said The Wall Street Journal – “well below some major US cities”. Going by homicide data, said Unherd, there is now “good reason” to believe Bukele’s claims that El Salvador is in fact the “safest country in Latin America”.\n\nWhile analysts dispute how much can be credited to Bukele, “he can surely claim some”, said The Economist. But “his scrapping of due process carries costs that will outweigh these benefits”.\n\nBukele’s crackdown has pushed the country down the Freedom in the World index from “free” to “partly free”, with the report citing corruption that undermines democracy and the rule of law.\n\nThe peace may not hold: in the past, gangs have “benefited from policies of mass incarceration by using prisons to recruit new members”, said Human Rights Watch, and strengthening bonds behind bars.\n\n“When massive rights violations become commonplace, it’s very rare for this to result in lasting peace,” Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nBukele is “highly undemocratic, highly abusive – and highly popular”, wrote Juan Pappier, acting Americas deputy director for Human Rights Watch, for El País.\n\nAbout 93% of Salvadorans endorse his presidency, according to a recent report: one of the highest rates in the world. In June, a poll by Salvadoran think tank Fundaungo reported that 53% of respondents had a positive view of the state of emergency. Only 9% had a negative view. About 40% of respondents said that crime reduction was the greatest achievement of Bukele’s tenure.\n\nThe crackdown has bolstered Bukele’s bid for re-election in 2024, despite a long-standing interpretation of the Constitution that forbids leaders serving a second continuous term. “The way the rules [of the Constitution] were redefined has raised fears Bukele could cling on beyond one more term,” said the FT.\n\nLatin American politicians are praising Bukele. In Peru, “there is talk of building a monument in his honour”, said the Los Angeles Times. In Honduras and Ecuador, “leaders have copied his draconian security policies”, while in Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia and Guatemala, “citizens have taken to the streets calling on their own governments to embrace his extreme strategies”.\n\nThe “brash young autocrat has won legions of fans” throughout the continent, and the criticism by human rights advocates “seems to only feed his cult-like status as a renegade willing to get things done, whatever the cost”.\n\nBukele’s security model “threatens democratic institutions in the region”, said El Pais. “His methods are ripe for copying anywhere with high crime and weak institutions,” said The Economist, and could “tip such places into autocracy”.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}]}

They'll be stuck sitting at home in pajamas on TV's biggest night.\n\nWhile Martin Short gets to check off his yearly nod for Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building,\" his costars Steve Martin and Selena Gomez didn't have the same luck. And \"Paradise,\" Hulu's post-apocalyptic thriller starring Sterling K. Brown and James Marsden, surprised with major drama category nods, likely pushing out previous nominees including \"Yellowjackets,\" \"Squid Game\" and \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"\n\nThis year's Emmy Awards celebrate shows that aired or streamed between June 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025 (meaning those \"The Bear\" nominations are for last year's third season, not the just-dropped Season 4). It's been a big year for TV, with heavy hitters like \"Handmaid's\" saying goodbye and buzzy new shows like HBO Max's \"The Pitt\" saying hello. The ceremony will air live Sunday, Sept. 14, 8 ET/5 PT on CBS (and stream on Paramount+), hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze.\n\n2025 Emmy nominees: See the full list\n\nHere are the most jaw-dropping and shocking stars and TV shows to miss out on nominations for the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nSteve Martin and Selena Gomez for 'Only Murders in the Building'\n\nThe trio is missing two-thirds of its comedic power. Hulu's \"Only Murders\" has been an Emmy mainstay since its 2021 premiere, with each of its three leads − Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez − grabbing at least one acting nomination over the four seasons that have streamed so far. But only Short has been nominated for all four of those seasons, and he's the only actor who made the cut this year.\n\nDiego Luna in 'Andor'\n\nAlmost universally acclaimed by critics, Disney+'s mature \"Star Wars\" series \"Andor\" got a well-deserved nomination for best drama series. But the show's star Diego Luna couldn't break into a crowded best drama actor category that included talented actors like Pedro Pascal, Noah Wyle, Gary Oldman, Adam Scott and Sterling K. Brown. Luna's supremely talented \"Andor\" costars Stellan Skarsgård and Genevieve O'Reilly didn't make it into the supporting categories, either.\n\nKeira Knightley and 'Black Doves'\n\nApparently there's only room for one British spy show in the hearts and minds of the Emmy voters. While Apple TV+'s delightful \"Slow Horses\" managed to get recognized in several categories for another consecutive year, Netflix breakout \"Black Doves\" wasn't quite as fortunate. Star Keira Knightley was on many prediction lists for the lead actress category, but she ended up as a spy left out in the cold.\n\n'Squid Game'\n\nThe Netflix juggernaut was an Emmy darling in its first season, garnering a best drama series nomination and a trophy for star Lee Jung-jae in 2022. But the second season of the series, which streamed in December 2024, couldn't score a nod in a single category any more than the \"Squid\" characters could make it out of \"Red Light, Green Light.\"\n\nNatasha Lyonne for 'Poker Face'\n\nNatasha Lyonne might need to work on her personal poker face. Although she received a nomination for her role as the lie-detecting accidental detective Charlie Cale in Peacock's \"Poker Face\" in its first season, she didn't make the list for her Season 2 performance. But the series did manage two nods overall, including one for \"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo, who used her acting magic to play quintuplets in the Season 2 premiere of \"Poker.\"\n\n'Yellowjackets' and Melanie Lynskey\n\nOnce a big presence at the Emmys, the series' third season didn't garner a single nod, not for previously nominated star Melanie Lynskey or the show itself. The first two seasons each were nominated for the night's top prize: outstanding drama series.\n\nBridget Everett for 'Somebody Somewhere'\n\nHBO's \"Somebody Somewhere\" is a quiet but superlative comedy about small-time life in Kansas that finished out a fantastic three-season run last fall. The Television Academy has finally caught up to its brilliance this year, nominating Jeff Hiller for supporting actor in a comedy and the show for a comedy writing award. But that leaves the series' star, Bridget Everett, behind. The creative success and emotional effect of \"Somebody\" is entirely contingent on the actress' nuanced performance.\n\n'Disclaimer' for best limited series\n\nThe best show of 2024 didn't get the Emmy love it deserved. While \"Disclaimer,\" Apple TV+'s twisty limited series from \"Gravity\" and \"Roma\" director Alfonso Cuarón, managed two nominations overall − for star Cate Blanchett and cinematography − the show should have been showered in nominations. The immersive series was a contender for best limited series and was competitive in additional acting races, primarily in supporting actor with Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\n'The Voice' for best reality competition series\n\nNot since 2012 has NBC's chair-swiveling singing competition been left off the list of the best reality competition of the year, but it's been edged out in 2025 in favor of series like Peacock's \"The Traitors.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/09/06/2024-creative-arts-emmys/75089471007/", "title": "2024 Creative Arts Emmy Awards: Dates, time, nominees, where to ...", "text": "While television's biggest night − the Primetime Emmy Awards − are scheduled for Sept. 15, one week before the event, the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles will host the 76th Creative Arts Emmy Awards to \"celebrate exceptional artistic and technical achievements in television.\"\n\nThe Creative Arts Emmy Awards will be held over two consecutive nights on the weekend prior to the Emmys and will include a \"diverse blend of beloved television stars and up-and-coming talents representing Emmy-nominated shows and popular television series across various viewing platforms and genres,\" according to a press release by the Television Academy.\n\nThe 76th edition is 2024's second Emmy Awards and comes only eight months after the 75th Primetime Emmys were presented on Fox, which were postponed following last year's writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nHere's what you need to know about 76th Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\n\n'And the Emmy goes to...': These are the most iconic Emmy moments of all time\n\nWhen are the 2024 Creative Arts Emmy Awards?\n\nThe 76th Creative Arts Emmy Awards will be held over two consecutive nights on Saturday, Sept. 7, and Sunday, Sept. 8 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nAn edited presentation of the ceremonies will air on FXX on Saturday, Sept. 14 at 11:00 p.m. ET / 8:00 p.m. PT one night before the main ceremony.\n\nThe show will also be available to stream on Hulu from Sunday, Sept. 15 through Wednesday, Oct. 9.\n\n2024 Creative Arts Emmy Awards nominees\n\nThe eligibility dates for the 2024 Emmy Awards apply to shows that aired between June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024.

Emmy category for big nominee is ...", "text": "The stressful, frenetic life behind the scenes at a gourmet restaurant. So funny, right?\n\nCongratulations to FX's \"The Bear\" for its many Emmy nominations this year in the comedy categories, including outstanding comedy series. It got so many nominations, in fact, it broke the record for most nominations by a comedy series in one year, with 23 nods. That's one more than the previous record holder: NBC's \"30 Rock,\" which nabbed 22 nominations in 2009.\n\nBut while the producers of \"The Bear\" are probably popping the Champagne corks, many viewers of the infamously stress-inducing, tense series might be wondering about the whole \"comedy\" part of those nominations.\n\nThe series, about a family-owned Italian-beef sandwich joint in Chicago that is transformed into a fine dining establishment by chef Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White, nominated for lead actor), isn't often laugh-out-loud funny. I prefer to call it a \"half-hour drama\" or \"dramedy.\" Sometimes the antics of \"cousin\" Richie (Ebon Moss-Bacharach, nominated for supporting actor) are so outlandish as to cause a chortle. But those laughs are somewhat incidental to the heavily dramatic plot, where the protagonist's brother died by suicide, inherited family trauma is a major plot point and the profanity is frequent and derogatory.\n\nSo why is it up against the likes of happy-go-lucky sitcoms like \"Abbott Elementary\"?\n\nThe short answer is, because it can! It's not the Television Academy that picks which categories TV shows compete in, but rather the networks and streamers behind them. So FX decided to submit \"The Bear\" as a comedy, and that's where it will stay. The reason is also pretty simple: Comedy categories are traditionally less competitive than drama, meaning all the Emmys the series won at the last Emmys are partially due to the shrewd decision by network honchos to go for the comedy gold. Plus, if it had competed in drama this year, it would have been up against FX's other heavyweight contender: \"Shogun,\" which scored 25 nominations, the most for any series.\n\n\"The Bear\" is far from the only dramatic TV series ever to compete as a comedy for a better shot at glory. There have been many cases of what awards-watchers like to call \"category fraud.\" Dark shows like HBO's \"Barry,\" Netflix's \"Russian Doll,\" Amazon's \"Fleabag\" all have competed (and won) as comedies in recent years. But you might be hard-pressed to laugh at the finale of \"Barry.\"\n\nIt's the age-old story of the Hollywood awards race. Whether it's actors competing in supporting categories instead of lead roles, dramas competing as comedies or returning series sneaking into the limited series category, there is always a little bit of campaign trickery and finagling. Whatever it takes to win, right?\n\nBack when Season 1 premiered, before all the hype and nominations, White had his own thoughts about whether the series could be labeled a comedy.\n\n\"I guess if you had to, I would describe it as a dramedy,\" he told USA TODAY in 2022. \"It's certainly funny at times. I don't think Carmy’s necessarily funny, but I think the situations that he finds himself in can be. I think it's interesting and funny to watch this young man who’s not a wonderful communicator trying to communicate what he wants and his feelings to a group of people who are also not excellent at hearing him. So I think there is comedy that comes out of that. I don't know if it's like knee-slapping funny. I think it can be at times. It's real, or we're trying to make it real, like real life. Sad things can be funny. Funny things can make you sad.\"\n\n\"The Bear\" is definitely skilled at making you sad and being sad, that's for sure. There are some laughs. And considering how many Emmys \"The Bear\" won in the comedy categories for its first season, it's pretty safe to say it might be breaking more records as a \"comedy\" at this year's awards, and for years to come.\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/07/17/emmy-nominations-white-lotus-hbo-severance/85249241007/", "title": "Emmy voters prove laziness with endless 'White Lotus' nods | Opinion", "text": "Every major award show has its Achilles' heel. The Academy Awards throw their golden statue at any studio willing to fork up the cash. The Grammys have terrible taste and seldom get it right. The Tonys are mostly fine, and who even cares about the Golden Globes? The Emmys, the awards body for the Television Academy, is no exception. Nominations for the 77th Emmy Awards, announced July 15, prove that Emmy voters are notoriously and aggravatingly lazy.\n\nApple TV+’s \"Severance\" received the most nominations (27), followed by HBO Max’s \"The Penguin\" with 24. \"The Studio\" and \"The White Lotus\" got 23 nods. I liked this season of \"Severance,\" and I’m glad a show with such a captivating concept and incredible performances is getting this praise. I haven’t watched \"The Penguin,\" and \"The Studio\" is … fine, but when looking through the acting categories, particularly the supporting categories, I noticed a common phenomenon: Most of the nominees are from the same two shows.\n\nThis isn't the first time, either. For the 75th Emmy Awards in 2023, every nominee in the supporting actor category was either from “The White Lotus” or another HBO Max show, “Succession” (come back, the kids miss you). This time, six of the seven supporting actor nominees and five out of seven supporting actress nominees are either from \"The White Lotus\" or \"Severance.\"\n\nI like \"Severance\" and I genuinely think the nods are deserved, so they get a pass (for now). But in an era when there’s so much quality television to watch and amazing performances to praise, the lack of diversity is unsettling and flat-out boring.\n\n2025 Emmy snubs wouldn't be so bad if voters weren't so lazy\n\nAre Emmy voters so lazy that they must clog up the acting noms with undeserving \"White Lotus\" performances to circumvent doing their jobs – actually watching the bounty of available television and nominating worthy performances from an array of programs? Do Sam Rockwell, Walton Goggins and Jason Isaacs all need to be nominated? I can make a compelling case for Isaacs, but IDK about the other two.\n\nThe motivation, or lack thereof, behind Emmy voters’ laziness remains unknown to us industry outsiders. Is their tunnel vision a result of artificially ushering certain shows into the TV Hall of Fame by drowning them in nominations? Do they just not have an eye for good performances? Is HBO lining their pockets? For us normal viewers, it doesn’t matter, nor does it make this whole ordeal any less boring.\n\nMaybe if Emmy voters got off their butts and actually did their jobs – how hard can watching TV truly be? I do it constantly – there wouldn’t be so many egregious snubs. \"Industry\" and \"Interview with the Vampire\" continue to be Emmy-less despite arguably being two of the best shows on TV right now.\n\n\"The Bear\" is still getting away with category fraud, receiving comedy nominations when it's so clearly a drama (and no, I don’t care for your pretentious explanations). Has anyone even watched season four? Perhaps if it were put in its rightful place, “The Rehearsal” starring Nathan Fielder could have gotten some nods.\n\nWhen are the Emmys? Why I'll still watch.\n\nNevertheless, there are some, some (some) silver linings.\n\nI was happy to see Janelle James and Michelle Williams get nods for their performances in \"Abbott Elementary\" and \"Dying for Sex,\" respectively. Owen Cooper from Netflix’s \"Adolescence\" became the youngest nominee ever for best supporting actor in a limited/anthology series or TV movie.\n\nBeyoncé received two nominations for her Beyoncé Bowl special. She was previously nominated in Variety Special categories for \"Lemonade\" and \"Homecoming\" but lost to James Corden's \"Carpool Karaoke\" both times. Yes, you read that right.\n\nDespite all my complaining, I will be seated on Sept. 14 for the Emmys ceremony. The Emmys are usually good at picking the least bad out of their disappointing nominees.\n\nAlso, I'm a sucker for award shows; I love watching an actor's dreams come true. But if \"The White Lotus\" wins more than two Emmys, we will have a problem.\n\nKofi Mframa is a columnist and digital producer for USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

Hallelujah, I could shout with joy for this just-ended FX comedy! \"Slow Horses\"? Finally, this brilliant Apple TV+ spy drama got noticed! \"The Morning Show\"? Well, I guess that was on TV this year, too!\n\nIf you're thinking, \"Wait, didn't we already do this in 2024?\" you would be right! The 75th Primetime Emmys aired this January, a delayed ceremony pushed back from September 2023 by last year's dual actors' and writers' strikes. This time around, TV shows that aired or streamed between June 2023 and May 2024 qualify. This year's second Emmy ceremony will be held Sunday, Sept. 15, 8 p.m. EDT/5 p.m. PDT on ABC (which hasn't named a host yet).\n\nSo now we're looking at the best of the best from the past year in TV, at least according to the Television Academy. There were snubs, there were surprises and there were some very big \"finally!\" moments too. Here is everything you need to know about the 2024 Emmy nominations.\n\nBiggest Emmy nomination surprise: Selena Gomez in 'Only Murders in the Building'\n\nIt took three seasons and five nominations for her costars Steve Martin and Martin Short (three for Short and two for Martin), but the third member of the \"Murder\" trio finally has a shot at Emmy gold. Fans have decried Gomez's snub for two straight years and are joyous today. And there is an argument to be made that the cartoonish performances by Short and Martin wouldn't play half as funny without Gomez's straight-man reactions.\n\nBiggest Emmy nomination snub: Emma Stone and 'The Curse'\n\nShowtime's \"The Curse\" was so very weird and also so very wonderful. Nathan Fielder and Emma Stone led the offbeat (and very disturbing) dramedy about an HGTV-like couple and the potential curse laid upon them. Oscar winner Stone delivered her second best performance of the year (after \"Poor Things,\" of course) and at least deserved a nomination for her superb acting.\n\nBest and most deserved Emmy nominations: All that 'Reservation Dogs' love\n\nOne of the best series of the past decade, FX's \"Reservation Dogs\" was ignored by the Emmys for its first three seasons. But it finally broke through for its exquisite finale, with a nomination for best comedy and best lead actor for the phenomenal D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai. I would have loved to see more love (it didn't write and direct itself), but I will happily take what I can get.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

That same kind of goodwill has catapulted Apple TV+'s terrible \"Palm Royale\" to 11 nominations, including best comedy series and best actress in a comedy for Kristen Wiig. Look, I love Wiig and the many talented people she got to do this series, including the legendary Carol Burnett (also nominated). But this series was a cacophony of dumb plots and screechy characters wrapped up in 1960s flair with one of the most dumbfounding finales I've ever seen. That slot could have been taken up by so many great comedies from this past year, such as Peacock's \"We Are Lady Parts\" (always under-the-radar and underrated).\n\nLooking for reliable streaming options?

The points he racked up in the silver ball game, the lights that flashed as he made the right rolls, all that played into his 2018 season being better than most. But what truly made the year was watching the growth of the pinball scene in South Carolina.\n\n“We’ve attracted a ton of new people,” said Pietras, who’s part of the Palmetto Pinball Club. “It’s been fun for me to watch a lot of the new players really start getting into the competitive realm and working on the games and improving their games.”\n\nThat explosion in South Carolina’s pinball community is culminating as the 6th annual International Flipper Ball Association’s South Carolina Championship Series is set to take place Saturday in Pelzer, South Carolina.\n\nThrough 2018, the Palmetto State’s best pinball players challenged each other in IFBA sanctioned events, racking up points in the ranking system. Last year, 200 South Carolina players partook in official tournaments, Pietras said. The top 16 players battle each other in South Carolina’s pinball finals.\n\nThe winner in South Carolina has the chance to compete in the IFBA’s March finale in Las Vegas where $62,000 in cash and prizes will be up for grabs in the bracket style tournament.\n\nWhile it may sound like fierce competitors are duking it out, Pietras said the the community of players are good sports. Still, as the tournaments narrow to crowning the state’s pinball royalty, “The top ranked players take it pretty seriously,” Pietras said.\n\nThe growth in South Carolina pinball is reflected nationally, according to Zach Sharpe, Vice President of the IFBA.\n\nIn 2006 the IFBA sanctioned 52 tournaments across the U.S. Last year, the organization sanctioned over 5,000 events.\n\n“The sport is going through a huge resurgence right now,” Sharpe said.\n\nSharpe, who is one of the top 10 ranked players in the world, said that tension between players exists in the moment of bouts, but when those games are done it’s back to being friends.\n\n“I’ve been a player since the early 90s, and I’ve had friends through pinball for 20 years now,” Sharpe said. “In the moment it’s a very competitive thing but in between balls or games it’s a very friendly vibe.”\n\nWhere Columbia players go to hone their skills and partake in monthly tournaments is Firefly Toys and Games. After a few years of bouncing around, playing at whatever spot that had some machines and having their own clubhouse with about a dozen machines, the Palmetto Pinball Club found a new home when Firefly move to it’s current Irmo location and built an arcade styled room, equipping it with more than a dozen machines. Pietras calls Firefly’s pinball room “premiere” not just for South Carolina but premiere for the Southeast, he said.\n\nOn an average night eight to ten players may show up for causal practice or just to enjoy the game, Pietras said. During sanctioned bouts, usually about 20 to 30 people compete. As part of the growth in South Carolina, monthly tournaments have started in Greenville and Charleston.\n\n“The tournament scene in South Carolina has evolved quite a bit,” Pietras said. “It’s people hanging out and having a good time but playing pinball pretty seriously.”\n\nIf a non-pinballer wanted to get involved, it’s a welcoming crew as Pietras described. One key to being good at pinball is knowing the variety of machines and how to score points on individuals games. But the main tenant of pinball to Pietras is this — “It’s all about being able to catch the ball on your flipper and cradle it”\n\nStarting out, people don’t realize how much control a player can have over the ball if they know how to catch and release on the flippers, Pietras said.\n\n“It changes the game from something that’s random and fun to something that’s controllable and much more fun,” Pietras said.\n\nBringing the IFBA championship title from Las Vegas to South Carolina “would be absolutely huge” to Pietras. But he’s realistic about his chance of being the player to hoist it into town. His chance of winning his own state tournament is slim, he said, though he ranks fifth in South Carolina.\n\nBut one Palmetto State player, Fred Richardson, may give the IFBA title a run, Pietras believes.\n\nRichardson is the top player in South Carolina and in the top 50 of the IFBA rankings. To beat Richardson, Pietras said he would have to have a really good day and his opponent have a really bad day and that’s not likely to happen.\n\nEven without much of a shot, the love of the game outweighs the competition to Pietras particularly when it comes to new people getting into pinball.\n\n“I like to see people play and just get better,” he said. “I love watching someone good play.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/sports-betting/2019/06/25/betting-business-las-vegas-and-reno-casinos-are-betting-on-esports-to-draw-millennials/40082381/", "title": "Las Vegas, Reno casinos looking to Esports to bring in millennials", "text": "Ed Komenda and Jason Hidalgo\n\nSportsbook Wire\n\nLAS VEGAS - The light beam piercing the clouds above the Luxor for years beckoned tourists to a traditional casino landscape of slots, card tables and smoky corners of the night club scene.\n\nIn 2017, a longstanding piece of that landscape disappeared to make room for a new attraction that casinos are wagering is the future of entertainment in Las Vegas: esports.\n\nOn the grounds of the former LAX Nightclub now sits the smoke-free and well-lighted HyperX Esports Arena. The 30,000 square-foot facility designed to host live video game tournaments broadcasted to thousands watching online also offers a place for tourists to play their favorite games at consoles and PCs for an hourly fee.\n\nThe swap from night clubs to video games represents a major business shift in Las Vegas, where casino companies struggle to find new and relevant ways to draw tourists of younger generations - and their money - to a vacation mecca built on brick-and-mortar gambling.\n\n\"I would love to see Vegas be somewhat of a Disneyland for esports,\" said Lovell Walker, head of the esports department at MGM Resorts International. \"(A place) where a customer or consumer or fan of esports for that matter looks at Las Vegas as if it is Disneyland, and there's an expectation that something esports related is going on in our city.\"\n\nIt may be the best bet casinos have ever made.\n\nConsumers of the future\n\nGaming companies embrace concepts that move people into the casino. At the Luxor, esports has become a reliable tool to increase that traffic.\n\nDuring a slow season, the HyperX arena draws 700 people onto the casino floor, according to Mark Green, vice president of global properties at Allied Esports International, the company that runs day-to-day operations there.\n\nOn a busy day, that number jumps to 1,500. That statistic is favorable in the eyes of resorts. After all, even if gamers don't gamble, they surely need to eat - and there are plenty of restaurants on the way to the arena.\n\n\"MGM realizes there's a future in esports,\" Green said. \"They've wrapped their arms around it. They want to drive traffic.\"\n\nGreen took the job after a long career in nightclubs and restaurants. He didn't know what to expect entering the world of esports, but one thing became certain a short time into the gig: Gamers are easier to deal with than clubbers.\n\n\"We did an after party for a gaming publisher, and we told the hotel there's going to be 1,000 people,\" Green said. \"They went, 'Oh my god, we're going to need 30 security guards' and I was new to it, too. When the event happened, I didn't need one security guard.\"\n\nNo fights. No arrests. No problems.\n\n\"Somebody put somebody on their shoulders,\" Green said of the single instance when security had to ask gamers to dampen a celebration.\n\nThe response? \"'No problem, sir,'\" Green said.\n\nIn the esports division at MGM, Walker, an avid FIFA and Madden player, said the company is focused on capturing that kind of visitor - the consumer of the future.\n\n\"At a macro level we're in the midst of becoming an entertainment company. Gone are the days when we're focused solely on casinos. We're now focused on our entertainment values - that's food and beverage, the night clubs, the pools, the full package of offerings and esports is a piece of it,\" Walker said. \"This is what our future consumer wants and this is what the consumer of today wants. It's very much a learning phase for us, but we're very much in the midst of embracing what's coming and doing the right things to get into the game.\"\n\nEsports sweeping through Nevada\n\nThe strong esports action in Las Vegas has caught the attention of convention and tourism authorities up north.\n\nThe topic of esports has come up several times in the last few years during meetings of the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority, which works to bring in events to the area and promote tourism to the Reno-Tahoe region.\n\nEsports is seen as a way to attract a younger crowd such as millennials and diversify Northern Nevada's tourist pool, which has traditionally relied on events that skew to an older demographic such as Hot August Nights.\n\nReno Mayor Hillary Schieve, who sits on the visitors authority board, asked if any considerations were being made for hosting esports during a discussion in June last year about a proposed $164 million remodel of the Reno-Sparks Convention Center.\n\n\"Esports have gotten huge and that would be fantastic for this market,\" Schieve said at the June meeting. \"It's one of the things that really needs to be looked at because I see this as the wave of the future.\"\n\nAlthough esports attendees do not spend as much as traditional convention goers, they still spend money on restaurants, breweries and other businesses, said Mike Larragueta, the board's vice president of sales.\n\nLarragueta brought up Las Vegas as an example of esports' potential.\n\n\"They have facilities there dedicated to esports … and consumers are paying thousands of dollars to go to arenas and watch people compete,\" Larragueta said.\n\nOne Reno hotel casino that has a history with esports in The Biggest Little City is the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa.\n\nThe property has hosted several local events in its Fun Center arcade over the years, including Street Fighter tournaments as well as Smash Bros. competitions where attendees bring their own controllers and televisions.\n\nThe tournaments worked especially well in bringing traffic to the hotel casino's arcades. While arcade machines were incredibly popular in the 1990s, the advent of powerful home consoles and PC gaming led to a decline in the arcade scene nationwide.\n\n\"We've noticed that people who come in for the tournaments play the other arcade offerings that we have while they're waiting,\" said William Tiehm, Fun Center and esports manager for the Atlantis. \"It complements what we already offer.\"\n\nWhat happens when there's no competition?\n\nThe spaces these properties are building for esports can also be used by everyday tourists looking to get a video game fix.\n\nLike the HyperX arena in Las Vegas, the Atlantis Esports Lounge features consoles open for play. That includes PlayStation 4 Pro consoles with popular games such as Mortal Kombat 11, Street Fighter V, Fortnite and Call of Duty Black Ops 4.\n\nWhile the lounge was created with esports in mind, guests can also rent them out for $10 per hour on weekends - the same daily price at the Las Vegas arena - and $5 per hour on weekdays when there are no local tournaments scheduled.\n\nEventually, Atlantis hopes to expand the lounge with gaming PCs as well so it can host popular games such as League of Legends. Many professional players also prefer to play shooters on a PC with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA 'gamified' life\n\nAt UNLV's International Gaming Institute, Robert Rippee runs the Esports Lab.\n\nHere, students develop presentations and business plans to help the casino industry better understand the behaviors and interests of millennials - their target audience.\n\n\"Increasingly, we find this idea of gamified life,\" Rippee said, pointing to video games used in classrooms to help students learn faster. \"Educational psychologists have known for a very long time that computer-based learning works very very well. Is it any wonder that video gaming is a natural part of their life?\"\n\nVideo games, he said, have become a part of everyone's lives - whether they know it or not.\n\n\"Facebook is a game. You play with your friends and people you're trying to impress or attack,\" Rippee said, laughing at the social media generalization. \"This kind of gamification has been prevalent in our society for a long time, and it's only gotten bigger.\"\n\nIt was only a matter time before casinos figured out a way to monetize the trend.\n\nMORE:\n\nBurmese python discovered in surprising place\n\nUFC fighter makes opponent flinch by screaming in his face during staredown\n\nPackers' puzzling goal-line decisions end in disaster\n\nRangers ripped for not catching easy foul ball so pitcher could reach milestone\n\nAn 11-player wall couldn't stop this indirect free kick game-winner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mls/2025/01/18/inter-miami-club-america-lionel-messi-score-highlights/77728725007/", "title": "Inter Miami vs. Club America: Messi goal, score, penalty highlights", "text": "Lionel Messi scored a header to help Inter Miami respond to an early deficit, then he had a message for opposing fans in the stands in Las Vegas.\n\nMessi appeared to signal three fingers, perhaps to represent Argentina’s three World Cups while reminding fans of the Mexican league champions, Club América, their country doesn’t have a major soccer title.\n\nMessi’s celebration was playful and quickly went viral on social media after his first-half goal. But his young Inter Miami teammates stole the show in the closing minutes of Saturday’s preseason game.\n\nInter Miami defender Toto Aviles, 20, scored a header in the final minute of stoppage time (90+2’), from a corner kick by Julian Gressel, to tie the match and force penalty kicks.\n\nThen, 17-year-old Santiago Morales, a supplemental roster player for Inter Miami making his debut, had the deciding score to help Inter Miami beat Club América 2-2 (3-2 in penalty kicks) in front of 45,262 fans at Allegiant Stadium.\n\nMorales, the son of Inter Miami assistant coach Javi Morales, was mobbed by his teammates after winning the game.\n\nIt was a quirky penalty round. Club América missed its first three shots. David Martinez and David Ruiz also scored for Inter Miami.\n\nMessi — the World Cup and two-time Copa América champion with Argentina — received a pass inside the box from Luis Suarez and used his head to tap the ball into the net in the 34th minute for his goal.\n\nIt was a timely response after Henry Martin opened the scoring in the 31st minute.

The game can be streamed for free on Apple TV.\n\nDate : Saturday, Jan. 18\n\n: Saturday, Jan. 18 Time : 10 p.m. ET (7 p.m. PT)\n\n: 10 p.m. ET (7 p.m. PT) TV : None\n\n: None Streaming: Apple TV\n\nApple TV Location: Allegiant Stadium (Paradise, Nevada)\n\nInter Miami vs. Club América starting lineups\n\nIs Messi still playing for Inter Miami?\n\nLionel Messi, arguably the best player in soccer's history, will play for Inter Miami in the 2025 MLS season. However, there are no guarantees after that, as Messi's two-and-a-half-year contract, announced back in July 2023, expires at the end of the 2025 season.\n\nIt's an inflection point for Miami, MLS, and Messi, who will turn 38 this summer. From Messi's perspective, he's been able to dominate the league as expected: the former Barcelona star has scored 34 goals and added 18 assists in a total of 39 appearances across all competitions, and won the MVP award last season. It's not the largest sample size, but no player in MLS history has comparable numbers over the same span.\n\nOn the other hand, Messi's appearance total would be much higher if not for some persistent injuries and obligations outside the league. Messi has missed 21 matches over that same spell owing to thigh and ankle issues, not to mention national team duty for 2022 World Cup champions Argentina. That may give him pause in terms of how much longer he wants to play — particularly with the heavy travel demands in place with Miami, who will participate in the upcoming Club World Cup — and could impact the offer the team wants to put forward.\n\nClub owner Jorge Mas has said he is personally handling talks over a contract extension. Beyond the obvious cache of the world's most famous player suiting up for the Herons, Miami has a financial incentive to keep Messi in the fold. The club has a stadium under construction in Miami, with Freedom Park due to open in 2026. That should bolster Inter Miami's stature, as the club's current home Chase Stadium a temporary venue constructed in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nFinally, MLS is also looking at 2026 as a massive year. The thinking goes that the 2026 World Cup will supercharge attention for soccer in the U.S., as was the case after the 1994 World Cup. MLS will not have the option of simply signing another Messi if the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner retires or finds another club.\n\nHow did Inter Miami MLS season go in 2024?\n\nInter Miami had a lot of positives to take from the 2024 MLS season. The club won its first truly major trophy, bringing home the Supporters' Shield (given to the top team in MLS's regular-season standings). Lionel Messi won the league's MVP award, and the Herons' total of 74 points set a new league record for points in a single season. It was, by any reasonable measure, one of the best seasons an MLS team has ever had.\n\nHowever, the defining memory might be three bad results in knockout play. In April, Miami lost home and away to Mexican powerhouse CF Monterrey, crashing out of the Concacaf Champions Cup at the quarterfinal stage. Four months later in the Leagues Cup, the Columbus Crew trailed by two with just 23 minutes to play, only to eliminate Miami by coming back to win 3-2.\n\nMost of all, a playoff upset for the ages looms. Miami entered the MLS playoffs having lost just once in its final 17 regular-season games, and faced an Atlanta United side that needed to survive incredible drama just to claim the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Miami won the opening game in a best-of-three series as expected, but lost games two and three (despite taking a lead in both of those matches).\n\nInter Miami game location\n\nA bit of a departure geographically, Saturday's match for Inter Miami will be played at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.

She played on the club team her mother formed in Lulea into the ninth grade and went on to play for Swedish national under-16, under-18, under-20 and under-23 teams. Her club team won a national title in 2008, and she traveled to South Korea last summer to participate in the World University Games.\n\nMW CHAMPIONSHIP: 5 things to know: CSU's title-game against Fresno State\n\nEllen, a 6-foot-1 junior guard, has done pretty well for herself at Colorado State University, too, earning MW Player of the Year honors this season for a Rams team that is 30-1, ranked No. 22 in the nation and playing in the championship game of the MW tournament at 1 p.m. Friday against Fresno State (21-10).\n\nEllen averages 10.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists for the Rams, making her one of just seven players in the country averaging more than 10 points and five rebounds and assists a game.\n\nHer mother and father, both former players and coaches in the Lulea club system, said it’s hard to comprehend just how good their daughter has become at the family game. Her older brother, Gustav, also played on Swedish national teams and at Hope College in Michigan. And her older sister, Josephine, went into coaching young kids early after suffering a serious knee injury at a teenager.\n\n“She’s really talented,” said Ellen's father, Leif, who coached her brother’s teams when he was younger. “I agree with (CSU) coach Ryun Williams in saying Ellen doesn’t really know how good she’s maybe going to be.”\n\nBasketball has already taken Ellen around the world. Her passport is full, she said. Her parents have seen a lot of the world while watching her play, too. They’ve traveled to Romania, Slovakia and South Korea. They’ve come to Fort Collins for Christmas and New Year’s the past three years and made some good friends, including former CSU All-American track and field athletes Mattias Borrman, a native of Sweden, and his wife, Shelly. “His is probably the only house in Fort Collins with its own sauna,” Leif said.\n\nLeif, who runs a business selling fire engineering technology, can work from just about anywhere as long as he’s got an internet connection, he said. Lena is able to do some work on the road, too, but can’t be away for too long from the future middle-school teachers she’s instructing at Lulea University of Technology.\n\nOFF DAY: CSU women try to keep their edge for title game\n\nWhen they’re home in Sweden, they get up at 3 a.m. to watch her games online and chat with her every weekend via Skype or FaceTime. Social media, they said, makes it seem like she’s a lot closer to home than she really is.\n\nEllen, though, is glad her parents are able to come and visit as often as they do, and she’s enjoyed spending some extra time with them this week in Las Vegas. Her parents came to last year’s MW tournament, too, but only got to see the Rams play one game, a quarterfinal loss to San Jose State.\n\nThey had booked a five-day trip and spent the last four days watching other teams, including the CSU men, play tournament games long after Ellen and her teammates had returned home.\n\nThis week, they’re taking power walks in the morning for exercise, working online for a few hours each day and watching a lot of basketball. They took in three full games and part of a fourth Wednesday, catching the three overtimes of a men’s game between UNLV and Air Force along with the CSU men’s win over San Jose State, the women’s team’s win over New Mexico and the Fresno State women’s win over UNLV.\n\nMost of all, though, they’re rejoicing in the decision their daughter made to play college basketball in the United States, and CSU, in particular. It’s a decision Ellen didn’t originally think she’d make. She was planning to jump to the professional leagues in Europe as soon as she completed high school and only took the recruiting visit to CSU with club teammate Elin Gustavsson because it was “a free trip.” She saw people out and about, riding bicycles, going for walks and enjoying the outdoors. Colorado, she said, reminded her a lot of Sweden. “I went, and then I was just sold,” she said. After a few conversations on Skype with CSU assistant coach Tim Moser, who had watched one of her games and visited the family’s home in Sweden, and Williams, her parents were sold on CSU, too.\n\nHUB: Mountain West basketball tournament central 2016\n\n“I think the best thing with all this is that she can play at a high level and still get an education,” Leif said. “Normally, if you go pro directly, as many of her friends did, they end up like maybe 35 years old and stop playing basketball. And then what are you going to do with no education?\n\n“You’re not making a pension plan with the salaries in women’s basketball, so you have to find something to do after you finish your career. And when you have an education, it’s just great. Many people who go to the pros don’t have that, so I think it’s just a fantastic, fantastic opportunity.”\n\nNo more balloons and tennis balls.\n\nEllen’s playing real basketball now, on a team that a win away from securing a spot in the NCAA tournament.\n\n“It think this is the perfect situation for me,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/univ-oregon/2018/03/06/oregon-ducks-mario-cristobal-needs-turn-his-popularity-into-wins/391689002/", "title": "Oregon Ducks are adopting these approaches from Alabama and ...", "text": "When you listen to Oregon football coach Mario Cristobal, it’s easy to see why he is popular among his players.\n\nThe way Cristobal speaks is different than the Ducks' recent head coaches that the Ducks have had in the past.\n\nWith Chip Kelly and Mark Helfrich, you could always tell that they were holding back — they weren’t telling you everything, instead choosing to give vague answers.\n\nWillie Taggart was a “rah-rah” guy, who generally spoke in broader terms when he spoke about the Oregon program and expectations, and he did it in a charismatic way.\n\nCristobal is a straight-shooter who lives for the details.That becomes immediately apparent when he starts talking about the Ducks, like he did Tuesday on the eve of Oregon’s spring practices.\n\nCristobal said the program, including the players, wants to “establish a culture of excellence,” and “develop an intolerance for anything or anyone that does not uphold the standards of our culture. It’s important to our guys to make being a Duck a very important, a very difficult club to be a member of, because of the sacrifices we make and how hard we work.”\n\nCristobal knows what it takes to win a national championship — he won titles both as an assistant coach at Alabama and as a player for Miami.\n\nNow in charge, Cristobal is bringing in new strategies to help the Ducks utilize the offseason workouts and practices to better their chances for success on the field.\n\nThe first step he did was bring in an entirely new strength and conditioning staff, led by coordinator Aaron Feld. The goal is to use an intense training program that not only increases strength and mobility, but does it in a position-specific way. The program is based on what Alabama did while he was on Nick Saban’s staff.\n\n“The Oregon Fourth Quarter Program, as we call it, has really taken off. It’s had a significant impact on the way our guys are developing,” Cristobal said. “We do so much functional training, we do so much mobility work. Everything has a carry-over either to position-specific stuff, football movements, acceleration-deceleration work. You name it, we’re doing it.”\n\nOregon also will be implementing new drills to focus on both forcing opposition turnovers and preventing turnovers of their own.\n\n“We’re going to start practice with a turnover period, and a ball-security/tackling period, a lot like the New England Patriots use,” Cristobal said. “Good team to mimic, right? They do a decent job.”\n\nThere are a number of ways to break down the Ducks’ 2017 season. They went 6-2 with Justin Herbert starting at quarterback, and 1-4 with Braxton Burmeister behind center. In the 2017 season, the Ducks were 6-1 at home, and 1-5 away from Autzen Stadium.\n\nCristobal is concerned about how the players performed when they didn’t have a sea of yellow and green in the stands cheering for them.\n\n“We need to show consistency in performance. We were up and down, more specifically on the road,” Cristobal said. “We have to be a better football team when the environment changes and everything isn’t perfect.”\n\nHe’s saying the right things. The challenge now for Cristobal is to turn his popularity into victories on the field, and on Tuesday he outlined his recipe for doing it.\n\nBut it won’t be easy.\n\nIn December, after Willie Taggart left for Florida State, the Oregon players rallied around Cristobal. They used an organized and effective social media campaign, using the hashtag #Cristoballin, to help get him hired as the full-time head coach.\n\nThat movement reminded me of the scene in the movie “Rudy,” when Rudy’s teammates go into coach Dan Devine’s office to give up their jerseys for Rudy to play.\n\nIt was a powerful gesture by the Oregon players, and it felt like they were unified and ready to move on without Taggart.\n\nThen in the Las Vegas Bowl against Boise State, the Ducks’ performance was a complete dud. The team looked lethargic, and if it wasn’t for two late first-half defensive touchdowns, Oregon’s 38-28 loss would have been even worse.\n\nIt was a chaotic time for the program, no doubt. With Taggart’s departure, Cristobal’s hiring and the bowl game coming right before the early signing period, the preparation and focus were not there.\n\nCristobal addressed the Vegas bowl loss on Tuesday, and he wasn’t about to blame outside factors.\n\n“I don’t think you blame it on a whirlwind. I think you assess it for how you played, how you prepared,” he said. “Must do a better job, and you move forward. For us, it’s important to beat good football teams, whether we’re at home or away.”\n\nIn his three months on the job, Cristobal has done many things the right way — he’s drawing on his championship experience to make changes to the program, and after going 11-14 the past two seasons, change is needed.\n\nCristobal also delivered the 16th-ranked recruiting class in the nation, which was impressive considering the program was coming off an abrupt coaching change.\n\nBut the Las Vegas Bowl keeps sticking out to me. The players need to buy into the changes, and they need to prove it on the field.\n\nMuch of what happens on the field in the fall will be determined by what happens these next few weeks during spring practice.\n\nWas the #Cristoballin movement just a social media phenomenon, or was it the beginning of an Oregon football resurgence?\n\nIt’s time for the Ducks' players to answer that question.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/06/09/mlb-players-starting-to-fear-for-their-safety-from-gamblers/74028741007/", "title": "MLB players starting to fear for their safety from gamblers", "text": "Editor's note: The following story contains graphic threats of violence.\n\nPHOENIX — They receive death threats.\n\nThey are followed home by strangers.\n\nThey are abused and derided.\n\nThey are Major League Baseball players, who can tell you all about the menacing threats that have been inflicted upon their lives since MLB and gambling companies got into bed together.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\n\"You hear it all, man,\" Arizona Diamondbacks closer Paul Sewald told USA TODAY Sports. \"You blow a save, you don’t come through, you get it all. “(Expletive) you. You suck. You cost me all of this money.\n\n“(Expletive) you. (Expletive) your family. I’m going to kill you and then kill your family.’\n\n\"It gets ugly really quickly. It’s scary, and it’s sad. It used to be fans who were upset because you blew the game for the team, but now it’s gambling. These people don’t really care about the Diamondbacks. They just care about their bets, and we’re talking about money they don’t have that they are losing. So, it’s a very scary spot.\"\n\nOne MLB general manager told USA TODAY Sports that he received death threats delivered directly to his house, requiring police protection.\n\n\"I remember being followed home one time when I was playing for Cleveland,\" Diamondbacks reliever Logan Allen said. \"I had a really bad game, and this guy follows me home, and starts cussing at me, telling me I cost him all of this money.\n\n\"It’s scary.\"\n\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association began publicly voicing concerns about player safety after a Supreme Court decision that ultimately opened the door for it to become legal to gamble on sporting events in 38 states and the District of Columbia, with teams constructing sports-betting sites outside their ballparks. The union negotiated Amendment 61 to the collective bargaining agreement requiring teams to be proactive in curbing fans’ aggressive behavior toward players.\n\n\"Clubs shall include in their fan policies a prohibition against betting-related, abusive fan speech and behavior that is directed at players, players’ family members, club personnel or umpires. …\n\n\"The parties will jointly develop a safety hotline for players to report any threats, potentially threatening communications or other inappropriate sports bettor-related conduct or contact that a player or any member his family received related to sports bettor (e.g., social media messages threatening violence as retribution for a gambler’s losses.)\"\n\nThe amendments also restrict teams from placing gambling information on their scoreboard before and during games: \"No betting lines on player-specific performance or other player-specific betting-related information may be displayed on in-stadium videoboards or other in-stadium signage during a game or during pre-game warm-ups.\"\n\nYet, as the players will tell you, no scoreboard is needed with fans constantly reminding them about the odds, prop bets and parlays while they’re on the field before games.\n\nAnd if your team doesn’t win, or you fail to hold up your end of the prop bet, guess who hears about it?\n\n\"You get some messed up stuff, a lot of nasty DMs (direct social media messages),\" San Francisco Giants ace Logan Webb said. \"People are really passionate about teams, and now that you add money to it, it’s bigger than ever.\n\n\"My first year, there wasn’t that much gambling going on. It was just , 'Oh, you suck. You shouldn’t be on the team.’ Just things like that.\n\n\"Now, you’re getting, 'You just cost me money.’ They say some (messed) up (expletive). I get a lot of that with strikeouts. 'Hey, I got money on you for strikeouts. Are you going to hit it?’\n\n\"I always look up and say, 'Probably not.’\n\n\"There are times it gets pretty serious.\"\n\nWhen players like Giants third baseman Matt Chapman and Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker come to the plate, instead of their own fans cheering for them to get a hit, fans will remind them they have them in their parlay, and they better hit a home run or at least a double.\n\n\"People are always talking (expletive),\" Walker said. “You’re in the on-deck circle, and someone’s like, 'Come on, I need you. I need plus-2. Hit a double for me.\n\n\"People have their phones out as the game happens now. It’s not a situation anymore where you place a bet before the game, and then you’re at the mercy of it (the bet) the whole game. It’s real time as innings are unfolding and they make little prop bets.\n\n\"I can show you my DMs that are full with people talking (expletive), saying how you cost them money and saying some nasty (expletive). That’s part of it. It shouldn’t be part of it. But it is part of professional sports now.\"\n\nIt has become so appalling that fans are now requesting payment from players for their lost wages in bets.\n\n\"Fans used to just say normal things like, 'You’re a bum,’\" said Chapman, a seven-year veteran. \"Now, that they have all that money on us, fans will talk a lot of (expletive) to us. I’ll even have fans Venmo requesting me for money. I had to change my Venmo.\"\n\nSaid Giants veteran reliever Tyler Rogers: \"I had to make my Venmo private because I’d blow a game or something, and people would find me on Venmo, and they’d send me requests. 'Hey, you cost me $1,500. You better pay me back.'\n\n\"It definitely gets people a lot more upset than it used to.\"\n\nChicago White Sox outfielder Tommy Pham spends time at the Las Vegas casinos in the offseason, and sees how gambling has dramatically changed fans’ acrimony in recent years, particularly from those who are betting beyond their financial means.\n\n\"It’s getting completely out of hand,\" Pham said. \"As a Blackjack gambler myself, you shouldn’t bet on anything you’re not prepared to lose, but we know that doesn’t happen, and it brings out all of these keyboard warriors.\n\n\"It’s getting worse and worse.\"\n\nFrankly, it’s terrifying.\n\nBenjamin Tucker Patz, a 24-year-old sports gambler, plead guilty in 2021 for sending a string of social media messages to four players on the Tampa Bay Rays and one player on the White Sox after a 2019 game the Rays lost.\n\nHere’s a sampling of the horrifying messages to one Rays player:\n\n\"I will sever your neck open you pathetic (expletive).\"\n\n\"I will enter your home while you sleep, and sever your neck open.\"\n\n\"I will kill your entire family.\"\n\n\"Everyone you love will soon cease.\"\n\n\"I will cut up your family.\"\n\n\"Dismember them alive.”\n\nPatz also sent threats to players on Atlanta, San Diego, Oakland, Cleveland, Baltimore, Kansas City and Toronto.\n\nSo what was Patz’s punishment when he plead guilty?\n\nThree years of probation and six months of home confinement. Not a single day of jail time.\n\nThe odds of Patz’s deviant behavior being just an isolated incident is the same as believing there are no other players who gamble on baseball; no club employees are routinely providing lineup and health information to gamblers; and that Ippei Mizuhara, Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter, made 19,000 bets without telling a soul.\n\nStill, despite the inherent danger, not only to players but to the potential integrity of the game, Major League Baseball endlessly promotes gambling websites.\n\n\"You cannot watch one set of commercials between innings without a gambling commercial,\" Sewald said. \"FanDuel. DraftKings. MGM. Caesars. We’re promoting the hell out of this, and then to say, 'Oh, I don’t know what guys are gambling'?\"\n\nWhen MLB banned San Diego's Tucupita Marcano for life this past week after betting on baseball while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and suspended four other players for one year, it was to serve as a warning for other players as a reminder that it’s illegal to bet on baseball.\n\n\"It’s tough because it’s such a fine line,\" Sewald said. \"The more people that bet on our sport, the more people are watching. The more people watch, the richer we all get, right?\n\n\"But it’s such a slippery slope because it’s an addiction that people cannot stop. People get aggressive in this mode. We’re talking about real money, and they’re gambling with money that they don’t have.\n\n\"And it’s never been easier to gamble. Everyone can do it in their phone. This isn’t like illegal bookie stuff or sketchy stuff. Anyone can do it as easily as they want.\"\n\nIt’s too late to stop baseball’s affair with gambling. Gambling is far too lucrative to owners to halt all of the promotions, sponsorships and advertisements from gambling sites.\n\nYet, unless the promotions and advertisements start to at least be curtailed from their own network and games, until fans’ harassment, threats and intimidation stop, don’t be surprised if gambling scandals become as much a fabric in baseball as pine tar.\n\nMLB will soon implement an automatic strike zone, likely in 2026, sparing the umpires of all of the vitriol they receive. If you’re an umpire, do you really want the threats that await if you happen to miss a pitch in late innings?\n\n\"When that happens, you watch,\" Allen says, \"it will be a huge thing where people will start betting on automatic strikes. If they do the challenge system, there will be an over-under on how many times somebody challenges the ball and strikes in a game. How many are overturned? How many are wrong. They’ll start having (betting) lines for that, you just watch.\"\n\nYes, so don’t forget to stop by the Caesars Sportsbook when you walk through the gates of Chase Field to catch the Diamondbacks. Who needs to sit in the Wrigley Field bleachers when you can hang outside the ballpark at the DraftKings Sportsbook? Why brave the elements watching your first-place Cleveland Guardians when you can plop inside at the Fanatics Sportsbook at Progressive Field?\n\nOh, and if you’re a baseball player, please adhere to Rule 21, prohibiting you from gambling on baseball, but if you want to share some inside information with your gambling friends, hey, just don’t get caught.\n\nThe genie is out of the gambling bottle, death threats, corruption and consequences be damned.\n\nBesides, who needs integrity when there’s a revenue stream pouring oceans of gambling money into the game with everyone getting rich, right?\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n≻ The Chicago White Sox have no immediate plans to dismiss manager Pedro Grifol, refusing to solely blame him for being baseball’s worst team.\n\nThe White Sox believe it would make no sense to bring in and pay another manager when the team’s fate isn’t going to change no matter who’s in the dugout. Grifol is in the second year of a three-year contract for about $3 million. The White Sox are expected to re-assess this winter to determine whether a managerial change is needed.\n\n≻ The White Sox are listening to offers on anybody and everybody, including center fielder Luis Robert, who’s under contract through 2027, and owed about $61 million if his two club options are picked up. The White Sox would command a package greater than what the Padres gave up for Juan Soto at the 2022 deadline.\n\nIt’s unlikely they will trade ace Garrett Crochet (6-5, 3.33 ERA), who’s earning only $800,000 this season and won’t be a free agent until after 2026.\n\nIt’s also a longshot any contender would overwhelm the White Sox with a package of prospects knowing that he may be on an innings limit with his injury history. The White Sox are closely monitoring his workload after converting him from a reliever to a starter. His availability may be limited in the second half, and it’s questionable whether he would even pitch in September or October.\n\nCrochet, 24, who missed the entire 2022 season with Tommy John surgery, has already pitched more innings this season (75 ⅔ innings) than his career combined total (73 innings) in his previous three seasons.\n\n≻ The trade deadline could be quite dull if this mediocrity continues and teams don’t start winning.\n\nThere are only four teams in the National League who even have a winning record, and there are only five teams who are more than 4 ½ games out of a wild-card spot: the White Sox, Angels, Athletics, Rockies and Marlins.\n\nThere also have been 15 teams since 2001, including seven since 2016, who have gone from 10 games below .500 during the season to 10 games above .500. The Washington Nationals were 19-31 after 50 games and won the 2019 World Series.\n\nIt could be a seller’s paradise with so many teams in the race.\n\n≻ Rival executives believe that if the Toronto Blue Jays don’t turn it around, and are unable to sign Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette to extensions, they will be open to moving them.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have privately discussed the possibility of trying to acquire Guerrero at the trade deadline.\n\n≻ Juan Soto is having a much stronger season than he did with the San Diego Padres, several players say, because of the way Yankees center fielder Aaron Judge has embraced Soto.\n\n\"You can tell the difference,\" one Padre veteran said. \"He’s so much happier than he was here. You can tell he was just never comfortable. Now he is. He’s a different guy.\"\n\nCertainly, the stats prove it:\n\nSoto is hitting .318 with a 1.027 OPS playing for the Yankees compared to .248 with a .877 OPS with the Padres after the first 61 games of the season, including nearly twice as many homers and RBI.\n\n≻ The Philadelphia Phillies are keeping an eye on Diamondbacks left-handed hitting outfielder Jake McCarthy if the D-backs decide to make him available at the trade deadline.\n\n≻ The Colorado Rockies have already blown five games in the ninth inning or later while entering the ninth with at least a five-run lead, the most in a single season in the modern era, according to Codify Baseball.\n\n≻ If the Kansas City Royals’ future wasn’t bright enough, veteran scouts who have followed their rookie ball and Class A teams say they have seven players who are prized MLB prospects.\n\n≻ While Mets first baseman Pete Alonso is expected to seek at least $200 million in the free-agent market this winter, teams seeking first basemen can instead turn to Paul Goldschmidt, Rhys Hoskins and Christian Walker, all who are eligible for free agency.\n\n≻ The Padres have never been happier paying bonuses to a player than Jurickson Profar, who was signed to a one-year, $1 million contract. He’s earning bonuses for plate appearances that could max out at a total of $2.5 million.\n\nHe’s the best bargain in baseball and the Padres’ best player.\n\nHe’s hitting .322 with a major-league leading .419 on-base percentage and a .910 OPS.\n\n≻ This is the year, rival executives say, that the Seattle Mariners make their boldest move at the trade deadline and acquire offensive help knowing they have a legitimate chance for the World Series with their star-studded starting rotation.\n\nTheir most aggressive move in recent years was acquiring ace Luis Castillo from the Cincinnati Reds at the 2022 trade deadline, going 35-24 the rest of the season and ending their 21-year playoff drought.\n\nMets first baseman Pete Alonso may be the perfect fit.\n\n≻ While teams like the Yankees would love to get their hands on Colorado third baseman Ryan McMahon, the Rockies have no plans to trade him. McMahon is beloved in the organization and is in the third year of a six-year, $70 million contract.\n\n≻ The Diamondbacks are willing to listen to offers for struggling third baseman Eugenio Suarez, who could soon lose his everyday job. Suarez has a $15 million club option the D-backs don’t intend to exercise.\n\n≻ Texas Rangers GM Chris Young’s contract expires after the season, but the Rangers are expected to reward him with a lucrative extension later this year.\n\n≻ So how has it worked out for starters Blake Snell and Jordan Montgomery, who missed spring training and signed two-year contracts with opt-outs in March?\n\nSnell is on the injured list for the second time with an 0-3 record, 9.51 ERA, 1.944 WHIP, pitching just 23 ⅔ innings this season. He has yet to pitch five innings in a start.\n\nMontgomery has been healthy but is 3-4 with a 6.80 ERA and a 1.727 WHIP. He is averaging just 5.6 strikeouts per nine innings compared to his career 8.2-strikeout rate per nine innings.\n\n≻ While the Marlins are shopping virtually anyone and everyone, only reliever Tanner Scott appears to be definitely moved. They will have to eat a significant portion of first baseman Josh Bell’s $16.5 million contract in any trade.\n\n≻ Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Giancarlo Stanton are are the first trio in Yankees franchise history to hit at least 15 homers through the team’s first 62 games.\n\n≻ Phillies All-Star Bryce Harper continues to lobby MLB officials to permit MLB players to participate in the 2028 Olympics, even though it would require shutting down the season for perhaps three weeks.\n\n\"There’s nothing more worldwide than the Olympics,\" Harper told reporters in London. \"I watch the most random sports in the Olympics because it’s the Olympics, and that’s really cool. I love hockey. It’s one of my favorite sports to watch. To see (the NHL) take that three-week break and let those guys go play, that’s another big goal that we should have as Major League Baseball.\n\n\"I’ve talked to numerous people with MLB about it.

No matter the cost, she said she was committed to going \"Lions crazy,\" adding that at 61 years old, she wanted to see the team win before she keels over and dies. She was somewhere between hyperbolic and dead serious. Either way, she made us laugh.\n\nMy husband and I were in the back of the driver's mini van listening to stories about her children, her late husband, the sermon her pastor delivered that morning and her own preaching for the key to marital success. We were on our way to a bar-crawl of Detroit’s Black-owned cocktail bars at the prompt of traveling food critic Starex Smith.\n\nWith more than 217,000 Facebook followers, Smith, who runs The Hungry Black Man, a platform dedicated to reviewing Black-owned eateries, shared a Free Press story on the $20 million economic impact expected for Detroit amid the Lions-Buccaneers showdown. His plea for Detroiters, and visitors alike, was to share the wealth with Black-owned businesses, which tend to be underfunded and under-resourced. Bars, he said, are equipped with televisions and encourage the social nature that comes with watching a game that can span up to four hours. Other establishments like restaurants, tend to limit table times to 2 hours, often less.\n\nSmith compiled a list of Black-owned bars and mapped their locations for viewers to navigate with ease.\n\n“I found a culinary and social home in Detroit’s bars, which are unlike anywhere else in the nation in many ways,” Smith said. “The sheer number and options of which bar to choose are the most beneficial. Realizing this, I felt that the city would benefit from celebrating the uniqueness of having the largest number of Black-owned bars within its boundaries in the nation! Why not celebrate both this amazing accomplishment along with the Lions' historic progression in the NFL playoffs? For me, it was a no-brainer.”\n\nThough based in Miami, Smith’s travels brought him to Detroit years ago and his love for the city has brought him back time and again to celebrate and support the growing Black-owned culinary community. The notion that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team from Smith’s home state, would rival the team of his home away from home, is an irony not lost on him.\n\n“I am a Miamian, not a Floridian. We are not Florida. We are something entirely different,” he clarified. “I’m a DolphFan, so once we got beat, my second team is my second home, the city I’ve come to love, Detroit! It feels great to see the team progress along with having a native Miamian as its second-string quarterback...” Smith, who owns Miami restaurant Smith and Webster, said the Lions’ Teddy Bridgewater recently celebrated his birthday at the restaurant.\n\nAt Central Kitchen and Bar, our first stop on the Detroit bar crawl, the dining room was a monochromatic sea of diners clad in blue. Necks craned to see the television screens positioned throughout the space. In the first half, crowd expressions interrupted bites of crispy chicken and waffles and sips of mimosas and beer. Screams of excitement at successful field goals and sighs of despair at missed plays filled the room.\n\nSeeing scenic shots of the city’s landmarks on a national stage — the glacial water beneath the Ambassador Bridge, the Joe Louis Fist, an overhead glimpse of a snow-capped Belle Isle — brought a sense of pride to all.\n\nSmith later called on Detroiters to vote on their 10 favorite bars among his original comprehensive list of Black-owned bars. He plans to release the Top-10 List on Monday. In the meantime, he participated in a Black-owned bar-crawl of his own during the playoffs game.\n\n“My favorite bar didn’t make the Top 10 List, but it's Top 10 for me, and I will probably spend most of my time watching [the game] at Club Celebrity,\" he said Sunday morning.\n\nOur next stop landed us at Flood’s Bar and Grille in downtown Detroit, where game-watchers were clustered around tables nearest the bar’s flat-screen TVs. Blue and gray balloons were strung at the entryways that separated rooms and double-decker speakers propped in a back bar area let us know there’d be a celebration no matter the outcome of the game. On commercial breaks, hip-hop blared through the speakers and drinks flowed freely.\n\nWe finished the second half at The Shadow Gallery, whose layout allows you to choose your own adventure. It’s here where we collectively shouted expletives as the Bucs players brazenly butchered Detroit’s signature Blade Icewood dance as a touchdown celebration, and here where we’d be ultimately vindicated by the Lions’ victorious win.\n\nThe lobby was well-lit and guests were entranced by the two flatscreens suspended side by side with Moet bottles decorated in faux flowers beneath them. A dark back room was more of a nightclub where guests were vaping and playing cards under neon lights that vacillated between primary colors, casting green, orange, yellow, blue, purple and red glows on the space. There was no sound on the game here, just the bass of trap music. Cups were embossed with the Lions logo and 1800 Tequila branding.\n\nIn the upstairs lounge, where I watched the Lions’ game-winning interception, the crowd of adults and children erupted in squeals under soft pink lights. Cameras ceremoniously came out to capture the historic moment and strangers hugged and high-fived.\n\n“NFC champions!” one man shouted. “We heading to Vegas, baby!” a manager cheered.\n\nOn the car ride home, I thought of our Lyft driver, who said she was too superstitious to watch the game.

As a huge Bills fan, I was rooting for Allen to do well.\n\nBut an analysis of recent online search trends indicates that team loyalty like mine may not be as widespread in the age of free agency and social media. Plenty of sports fans are more interested in individual players than teams.\n\nThis is seen throughout football, the sports industry and even across continents – with Allen and the Bills proving a fascinating example of this growing phenomenon.\n\nThe Bills have historically not been a team with national appeal. Based in the second smallest metropolitan area in the US for a pro football team – according to the 2020 US Census, Buffalo had a population of 1.17 million compared to New York City’s 20.14 million – their games are rarely shown nationally often.\n\nAllen on the field before a game against the Atlanta Falcons. Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images\n\nHowever, I noticed something while reviewing which local television markets were broadcasting which games this season. All Bills games weren’t just shown in Buffalo’s local market, but also in the Southeastern Wyoming market.\n\nFor those without a map, southeastern Wyoming is thousands of miles from Buffalo. So why do people there even care?\n\nWell, for starters, southeastern Wyoming is home to the University of Wyoming, where Allen went to college and starred for the Cowboys. Also, the state doesn’t have an NFL team of its own, so it makes sense they want to keep tabs on a local hero.\n\nAllen throws for the Wyoming Cowboys against Boise State on October 21, 2017. Loren Orr/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nFormer CBS executive Steve Warner told me local television stations broadcast Bills games because they know their viewers are interested in watching Allen play.\n\nWe can see how much interest Allen has drummed up in the Bills since his arrival by looking at Google search data.\n\nAllen’s Bills are the most searched team over the last year in New York, not surprisingly, likely due to their consecutive AFC East division titles and the New York Jets’ and Giants’ recent struggles.\n\nThey’re also the second most searched team in Wyoming. To put that in perspective, there’s no other state outside the Northeast where the Bills are even in the top five most searched teams over the last year. The Bills also ranked in the top two in Wyoming from March to August 2021 before the NFL season began, so it’s not that people are searching for the Bills in Wyoming just because their games are being shown there.\n\nAn examination of Google data in 2017 – before Allen’s arrival in Buffalo – shows things were very different. While the Bills did rank No. 1 in New York searches, they didn’t rank inside the top 20 in Wyoming.\n\nIn other words, the data suggests that Allen is driving interest in the Bills among a group of people who previously hadn’t cared much about the Buffalo team.\n\nAllen isn’t an outlier in the NFL regarding this phenomenon.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert appears to be having a similar impact on football fans in Eugene, Oregon. Herbert is from Eugene and his alma mater, the University of Oregon, is based there; most Chargers games are being shown in Eugene; and a lot of people in the area are Googling the team.\n\nDuring the 2021-2022 season, the Chargers were the most searched team in the Eugene area. Five years ago, the Chargers didn’t even rank in the top 15 teams most searched in the Eugene area.\n\nJustin Herbert looks to throw against the Las Vegas Raiders. Chris Unger/Getty Images\n\nBut it’s not just about fans of college football who are following individual players. NFL fans do it too.\n\nQuarterback Tom Brady was a mainstay of the New England Patriots for two decades – until 2020, when he signed a multi-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nNew England still loves its Patriots, but it now has a second love in the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were the second most searched team in every New England state in 2021, except for Connecticut.\n\nBack in 2017, the Buccaneers weren’t even in the top 20 most searched teams in any New England state.\n\nNo doubt, Brady having over 10 million Instagram followers makes it easier for his fans to keep up with what he’s doing and root for him, regardless of where he plays.\n\nIt’s a trend we also see in other sports. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Lebron James, for instance, has over 100 million Instagram followers. That’s more than double the population of California.\n\nClearly, the basketball superstar has fans in markets across the country – and the world.\n\nIn Ohio, where James is from, the Cleveland Cavaliers are always the most searched team on Google. But each time after James left – for the Miami Heat in 2010 and LA Lakers in 2018 – his new teams became the second-most searched teams.\n\nJames looks to pass the ball during the second quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies. Katelyn Mulcahy/Getty Images\n\nRooting for players over teams and the importance of social media appear to be even more the case internationally. As my colleague Aimee Lewis pointed out in 2018, soccer fans are moving their loyalties from team to team based on who is playing for those clubs.\n\nSomeone like Cristiano Ronaldo, with his nearly 400 million Instagram followers, can make fans shift allegiances overnight. The clubs that Ronaldo has joined have seen their social media following skyrocket.\n\nOf course, when Ronaldo moves cities, those same clubs can lose a lot of followers. Just ask Juventus, the Italian club Ronaldo left before returning to Manchester United this past season.\n\nVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\n\nRonaldo reacts during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Jack Thomas - WWFC/Getty Images\n\nIn the US, the importance of social media isn’t nearly the same, as American players simply have less followers at this point.\n\nBut as fans increasingly join social media and traditional media becomes less important, we shouldn’t be surprised to see players become more important than teams.\n\nGranted, that’ll never be the case for a fan like me.

And he insists that Sanchez is committed to being “the best he can possibly be.’’\n\nBut there have been past issues of indifference with Sanchez, when it comes to hustle and commitment to the defensive craft.\n\nTwice last year, Sanchez was placed on the disabled list with a right groin strain. After this disappointing season all around, Sanchez underwent an arthroscopic cleanup of his left shoulder.\n\nHe’s expected to be fully ready for spring training.\n\nBy late in the 2018 second half, manager Aaron Boone felt that Sanchez had righted the ship.\n\nStory continues after video\n\n\"I think this year is going to be a huge year of growth for him,'' Boone said. \"Going through some of the challenges and adversity that he went through, I think, is going to make him a better player.\n\n\"He's spent a lot of time in Tampa this winter. He's already in very good shape,'' Boone said. \"And I feel like he's going to come back and have a really great season for us on both sides of the ball.''\n\nAlso, he was “swinging the bat well but not getting anything to show for it early in the year last year,’’ Cashman said. “And that turned into a mind game a little bit.’’\n\nSo, the club is on board with Sanchez, who has completed his shoulder rehab at Tampa, Fla., and has returned to his home in the Dominican Republic.\n\n“The heavy-lifting phase of his rehabilitation process with the physical therapist is completed,’’ Cashman said. “He’ll come into camp ready to go.’’\n\nMore NY Yankees news", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/12"}]}

This makes them analogous to a tax. But because a minority of consumer spending goes toward imports, the tariffs would not hit all purchases equally.\n\nThere’s wide agreement that the tariff would affect consumers.\n\n\"Trump's proposal would be very harmful to household budgets,\" said Daniel Mitchell, an independent libertarian economist.\n\nHowever, the specific amount of the impact varies by study, and Harris’ figure of \"almost $4,000\" is on the high end of independent estimates.\n\nWhat Trump has promised\n\nAs president, Trump imposed a variety of tariffs, some of which his successor, President Joe Biden, kept in place.\n\nTrump has pledged a more expansive tariff strategy during his 2024 campaign. Across-the-board tariffs, rather than ones targeted at specific products or industries, drive his approach.\n\nTrump has proposed a 10% tariff (and at least once said up to 20%) on all nondomestic goods sold in the U.S., along with a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nEconomists suspect that countries facing new or expanded tariffs under Trump would impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods sold in their countries. For instance, when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018, six trading partners imposed retaliatory tariffs: Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico and Turkey.\n\nPreviously, a Republican National Committee spokesperson pointed PolitiFact to a study by the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group of manufacturers and labor unions that generally supports higher tariffs. The study says a 10% tariff \"would stimulate domestic production and raise economic growth to produce a 5.7% increase in real income for the average American household.\"\n\nHow big could the consumer impact be?\n\nThe proposed tariff policy changes’ possible effect on middle-income consumers varies widely depending on the study. (It would also vary based on a family’s economic circumstances.)\n\nThe American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, has projected annual additional costs per household of $1,700 to $2,350 for the 10% tariff and an additional $1,950 if the 60% tariff on China is added. That would equal $3,650 to $4,300 for both tariffs, which aligns with Harris’ statement.\n\nThe Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, projected that the 10% and 60% tariffs would collectively lower average after-tax incomes of U.S. households by about $1,800. That’s 55% less than what Harris said.\n\nThe liberal group Center for American Progress Action came up with a $3,900 figure, which is close to what Harris said. However, this estimate is based on a 20% tariff, which is on the high end of what Trump said Aug. 14 in Asheville, N.C. — that he was considering a \"10 and 20 percent\" across-the-board tariff, rather than 10%.\n\nThe Peterson Institute of International Economics, another Washington-based think tank, initially projected that the 10% and 60% tariffs would cost a middle-income household about $1,700 extra each year. They recalculated the data for the 20% tariff proposal and found the per-household hit at $2,600 a year. That was still below what Harris said.\n\nMitchell said consumers might be able to avoid some of the tariffs’ hit by buying fewer imports.\n\n\"But since American producers will raise prices to take advantage of diminished competition, consumers will still be paying more,\" he said.\n\nPolitiFact's ruling\n\nHarris said Trump \"intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax — call it a Trump tax — that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly proposed wide-ranging tariffs on foreign goods. Although tariffs are imposed separately from the tax system, consumers would feel their impact in much the same way as taxes.\n\nHowever, the specific dollar impact on consumers varies. Two estimates we found generally support Harris’ $4,000 figure; two show a smaller, though still significant, impact.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n\nOur sources", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2025/06/01/the-economical-impact-trumps-policies-southern-arizona/83900796007/", "title": "How President Donald Trump's policies and tariffs are reshaping ...", "text": "Longtime Nogales business owner David Moore Jr. remembers his father telling him how easy it was to make money in the border town when he opened his Western clothing store in 1980.\n\n“In those days, he says, when I opened the store … you could just hang your shingle out in front of the building and as long as you halfway paid attention, you'd be making money,” Moore recalled his father saying about a time when Morley Avenue was bustling and business was good.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/02/trumps-sweeping-tariffs-recession/82780969007/", "title": "Trump's sweeping tariffs could spell a US recession, high inflation", "text": "The sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, combined with his other import levies, likely would plunge the nation and world into a deep recession if he follows through on the plan, economists say.\n\nIt’s likely, however that the White House will provide carveouts, exceptions and subsidies that would allow the U.S. to narrowly avoid a downturn but still bring the economy to a standstill, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.\n\nThe most far-reaching version of Trump’s strategy would raise the effective, or average, tariff on U.S. imports to about 20%, comparable to the heavy import duties the nation imposed in the 1930s and that contributed to the Great Depression, Zandi said. Before Trump took office, the average U.S. tariff rate was about 3%.\n\nIf the 20% average tariff is imposed and kept in place for more than a few months, and U.S. trading partners retaliate in kind, “the U.S. and global economies will not suffer a depression, but they will suffer serious recessions,” Zandi said.\n\nZandi said it’s more likely U.S. officials will agree to carveouts, exceptions and subsidies to American farmers, and some countries won’t retaliate or will do so mildly. In that case, he said, the effective tariff rate would rise to 15% and the U.S. economy would stagnate but dodge a recession.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nA recession is informally considered to be at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. The technical definition, according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”\n\nThe measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria.\n\nWhat is the prediction for the US economy?\n\nThe new tariffs are expected to reignite inflation, hammering consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity. The prospect of the new trade regime is also dampening business confidence and is likely to curtail hiring and investment, forecasters have said.\n\nAll else equal, the tariffs would drive the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure from 2.8% to 4.8%, economist Sam Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients. The annual inflation gauge reached a high of 5.6% in 2022 because of product shortages and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIs inflation going to get worse in 2025?\n\nBut Tombs said the ultimate impact on prices likely would be smaller – pushing inflation to about 4% ‒ because retailers likely will absorb some of the costs and consumers will substitute goods made in the U.S. or in countries with lower tariffs. A rise in import prices is also expected to reduce imports, strengthening the dollar and making foreign goods cheaper for Americans. That would offset some of the impact from the tariffs themselves.\n\nTrump on Wednesday announced a 10% tariff on all imports as well as additional reciprocal fees on the 60 countries that contribute most to the U.S. trade deficit. The fees, Trump said, are designed to respond to those countries’ import tariffs on U.S. goods as well as other non-tariff trade barriers such as value-added taxes, currency manipulation and foreign government subsidies to local manufacturers.\n\nTrump said officials tallied those nations’ tariffs and their estimates of non-tariff barriers to come up with their tariff-equivalent rates. They then agreed to charge those nations a duty equal to half that total rate.\n\nFor shipments to the U.S. from the European Union, that means a 20% tariff; China, 34%; Japan, 24%; South Africa, 30%; and India, about 26%.\n\nThe new fees come on top of the 20% tariff Trump already has slapped on China; 25% fees on imported steel and aluminum; and 25% on some goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by a trade agreement. A 25% tariff on all imported cars and light trucks was set to take effect Wednesday.\n\nTrump apparently won’t increase tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the trade deal, Zandi said, somewhat softening the impact of the duties overall.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/06/29/will-tariffs-boost-factories-manufacturing-jobs/84284981007/", "title": "Trump's tariff promises face tough challenges ahead", "text": "Tariffs, according to the Trump administration, are the solution to many of America’s problems.\n\nMore revenue. More jobs. More equitable trade deals.\n\n\"I always say 'tariffs' is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,\" Trump said at a rally shortly after his January inauguration. \"Tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our country's businesses back that left us.\"\n\nBut economists aren’t so sure that tariffs will pan out to be a panacea, especially when the Trump administration appears to be treating them as a negotiation tool. Job growth could be lackluster, they told USA TODAY, while consumers get stuck with higher prices.\n\nWhile targeted tariffs can help certain industries remain competitive or aid national security, “blanket tariffs to even out trade deficits on a country-by-country basis is not a recipe for strong economic growth,” said Erin McLaughlin, senior economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit business-research group.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWill tariffs lead to more US factories?\n\nTrump has said tariffs will have factories “roaring back” into the U.S.\n\n“You see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said on April 2.\n\nEconomists are less confident, especially since the Trump administration has had a haphazard approach to its trade policy. Already, the administration has adjusted tariffs against the United Kingdom and China and says other deals are in the works.\n\n“It takes time to build factories and hire and train workers. Making money in manufacturing takes years of investment,” said Nancy Qian, an economics professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “No one’s going to do it if they think the demand will change, or the economic environment will be very volatile.”\n\nExperts say that’s especially true if companies expect tariff rates keep falling, as they did with China. Current rates are 30% after being as high as 145%.\n\n“One-hundred-forty-five percent was unworkable for many retailers and manufacturers working with China,” said Erin McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit business-research group. “We'll see if 30% triggers onshoring. We don’t know. That might not be high enough.”\n\nEven if companies decide to shift production out of China – which has a higher tariff rate than most countries – experts say they may find it more affordable to shift to lower-tariffed countries than move production to the U.S.\n\n“It seems like there's a bipartisan desire to pivot away from China,” said Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who served on the White House staff in both the Obama and Biden Administrations. But “that doesn’t necessarily mean (manufacturers) come to the U.S. Maybe they go to Mexico, maybe Vietnam.”\n\nOthers say tariffs could disincentivize certain companies from expanding production in the U.S. by driving up the cost of imported goods. Nearly one-third of U.S. manufacturers’ intermediate inputs are imported from other countries, according to a 2022 report from the Commerce Department.\n\nData already suggests some manufacturers are holding off on investments to see how tariffs play out.\n\nThe value of private manufacturing construction in the country remained near record levels but fell 0.6% month-over-month in April and 0.9% in March, according to the Census Bureau. The National Association of Manufacturers’ website says high interest rates, increases in construction material prices and economic uncertainty threaten growth in the months ahead.\n\n“Everybody is kind of in a holding pattern until the uncertainty gets resolved, so we’re in a little bit of a lull right now,” said Jeff Bischoff, chief sales officer at Lexington, Kentucky-based designer-builder Gray. “Companies just aren’t willing to make decisions on major investments when they don’t know what their input costs are going to be.”\n\nOther companies are outright canceling expansion plans amid the uncertainty.International Recycling Group halted plans to build a $300 million recycling plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, in part because “substantially higher project development costs” driven by tariffs, according to the Erie Times-News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMichael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, expects to see “some,” but not much, reshoring tied to tariffs.\n\n“There’s a sense in which we could, in theory, make everything we need here. But that would require undoing a lot of the way business is done today. So that transition would be very painful and it would make America a lot poorer,” he said. “It would take years, if not decades, to achieve. Even then, there’s some stuff we just wouldn’t be able to make here.”\n\nWill more manufacturing create more jobs?\n\nEven if manufacturers shift production to the U.S., it’s not clear that would result in a large influx of manufacturing work.\n\nCompanies that do reshore would face higher operating costs: labor is more expensive in the U.S. than other countries, and tariffs drive up the costs of imported inputs that factories rely on.\n\nTo trim costs, economists say they’d expect companies to increasingly turn toward automation.\n\nMcLaughlin of the Conference Board said she believes it makes sense to onshore some of the more technologically advanced manufacturing – think semiconductors versus textiles and toys.\n\nEven then, she’s not confident that onshoring would create many jobs.\n\n“The modern U.S. factory is probably not what we all imagined. And maybe not even what our administration imagines,\" she said. “They may not employ as many people because of robotics, the use of advanced equipment.”\n\nSome worry tariffs could actually drive manufacturing employment down by raising the cost of doing business.\n\nThat’s how tariffs played out under the trade war during Trump’s first administration, according to one paper. Federal Reserve Board economists found Trump’s first-term tariffs boosted manufacturing employment protected by tariffs by 0.4%, but those gains were more than offset by the jobs lost due to rising input costs (2%) and retaliatory tariffs (1.1%).\n\n“When you expected to see some of the employment gains and some of the reshoring the administration was talking about, there is not much evidence of that,” said Rodrigo Adao, an associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago. “That puts a little bit of a question mark going forward.”\n\nA May 21 report from Wells Fargo economists found a meaningful increase in factory jobs “does not appear likely in the foreseeable future,” with higher prices and policy uncertainty weighing on companies.\n\nMeaningful job growth is possible in the long term, but it would take at least $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment to add 6.7 million manufacturing jobs and return the sector to its historic peak, according to the report.\n\n“Even if current tariff policy sticks, a full rebound in manufacturing employment looks hard-pressed,” the report, led by Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House, reads.\n\nHasbro layoffs: Toymaker restructures due to tariff struggles and weak demand\n\nLower deficit, higher costs\n\nTrump in April acknowledged that tariffs may hit consumers’ wallets.\n\n“Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,\" he said during an April 30 cabinet meeting. “But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need.”\n\nTrump’s comments came when tariffs against China were at 145%. They have since dropped to 30% amid a 90-day pause, but even the lower tariff rates will likely mean price increases. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on June 18 said he expects a \"meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months.\"\n\nThe latest inflation report showed tariffs’ effects were more subdued than anticipated, but economists say higher prices will likely be here by summer. Major retailers like Walmart have already warned that they will soon raise prices to offset tariff costs.\n\nIn total, about three-quarters of businesses facing cost increases from tariffs plan to pass on at least some of those higher costs to customers, with a “significant share” of businesses raising prices for goods unaffected by tariffs, according to a May survey from the New York Fed. Over half of manufacturers and service firms said they hiked prices within a month of experiencing cost increases.\n\n\"The cost of the tariff has to be paid, and some of it will fall on the end consumer,\" Powell said after the June Fed meeting. \"That's what businesses say, that's what the data say. ... So we know that's coming.\"\n\nTariffs would cut federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, but also reduce economic output by 0.6% and reduce households’ purchasing power by increasing inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, according to a June report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAnother June report from the Yale Budget Lab found tariffs are set to increase consumer prices 1.5% in the short run, the equivalent of a $2,000 loss of purchasing power per household on average.\n\nConsumers can expect shoe and apparel prices to go up 33% and 28% in the short run and 18% and 15% in the long run, respectively, according to the Budget Lab. Food prices are expected to increase 2.2% in the long run, while vehicle prices would rise 11.9%.\n\nOther economic risks\n\nEconomists lowered their recession odds this year after China and the U.S. on May 12 agreed to lower tariff rates during a 90-day pause, set to expire in August.\n\nRyan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics, said his estimate dropped from 50% to 35% after the pause was announced. Goldman Sachs’ dipped from 45% to 35% in May, then to 30% in June. J.P. Morgan placed the odds below 50%, while Barclays has dismissed recession risks altogether.\n\nThe risk is still elevated compared to recession odds before Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2. J.P. Morgan, for instance, placed recession odds at 20% in January. Goldman Sachs in December said 15%.\n\nLooking forward, this year's tariffs and retaliation from other countries mean GDP growth is expected to be 0.6 percentage points lower in 2025, with the U.S. economy 0.3% smaller in the long run, according to the Yale Budget Lab.\n\n“In the short run, they’re going to make life harder for consumers, workers, and manufacturers,” Qian of Northwestern said. In the long run, if increased tariffs hold, “there will be more manufacturing in the U.S. but it will come at a very high cost. It’s hard to see how American manufacturing and American workers will win more than they lose.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/politics/soybean-farmers-china-tariff-trump", "title": "Trump's trade war looms over soybean farmers 4 years later | CNN ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nIt’s been nearly four years since China put tariffs on American-grown soybeans during a tit-for-tat trade war with then-President Donald Trump – and they remain in place despite the change in administrations.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has chosen to leave US tariffs imposed by his predecessor in 2018 in place on $350 billion in Chinese goods. In turn, Beijing has left its retaliatory tariffs on some agricultural products, including soybeans, and some American-made goods.\n\nThe Chinese tariffs hurt US farmers by making American-grown soybeans more expensive for Chinese buyers, who bought a majority of US exports prior to the trade war.\n\n“We’ve lived with tariffs for so long, it’s just the way we do business now,” said Iowa farmer Dave Walton, who saw prices for his soybeans plummet after the tariffs were put in place in 2018.\n\nHis farm is near the Mississippi River, where his soybeans are usually loaded onto a barge and then sent overseas after reaching the Gulf of Mexico. This location made it easy to export his crop.\n\nBut this year, Walton is trying to rely less on foreign buyers. Instead of exporting his soybeans, he is selling them to a domestic company that will use the crop for seed.\n\nWalton remains frustrated with the Biden administration for leaving US tariffs in place. If trade tensions eased, Beijing may lift the tariffs on US soybeans too. He’s also frustrated that the administration has so far failed to successfully appoint people to two key agricultural trade positions: The chief agricultural negotiator role at the Office of the US Trade Representative and the undersecretary for foreign trade position at the US Department of Agriculture remain open.\n\n“It signals to me that trade is not a priority for the administration. If it was a priority for them, they’d have those trade positions filled and they’d be working on updating trade agreements with China and other countries,” he said.\n\nBiden leaves tariffs in place\n\nEarlier this month, the Biden administration took a first step toward conducting a statutory four-year review of the US tariffs on Chinese goods – but officials have given no indication that the review will result in removing the tariffs.\n\nSo far, the Biden administration has resisted the pressure from the American business community to lift the tariffs, which has ramped up as inflation increases. In an interview last Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said all tools are on the table to address inflation but stopped short of saying whether lifting tariffs should be one of them.\n\nIn 2020, a truce was reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both sides stopped adding new tariffs as part of what’s known as the Phase One deal. Beijing also agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products.\n\nBut China fell well short of its goal, buying only 57% of the US exports it had committed to purchasing by the end of 2021. While agricultural exports to China returned to 2017 levels, they fell short of China’s commitment. Soybean exports fell more than 30% short of the target.\n\nBiden suggested earlier this year that China’s failure to meet its commitments is the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place.\n\n“It’s uncertain,” the President said in January when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” he added.\n\nImpact on US soybeans\n\nUS exports of soybeans declined sharply immediately after China put the tariffs in place in 2018. Soybeans lost more than 75% of their export value to China between 2018 and 2019, according to a report from the USDA.\n\nBut soybean sales to China have nearly rebounded to their pre-trade-war levels. Soybean exports to China were just 1% lower in the year after the Phase One deal had been signed than they were in 2017, the USDA report found.\n\nStill, it’s hard to know what would have happened without the tariffs in place.\n\n“The overall impact the tariffs have had on trade is a much harder thing to sort through ever since the ceasefire,” said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and former chief economist at the USDA.\n\nStill, he thinks it’s a “no-brainer” for the US to lift the tariffs. “It would help normalize trade,” Glauber added.\n\nSome farmers fear they may have permanently lost some of their Chinese buyers who turned to other countries for soybeans over the last four years.\n\nAs US exports to China increased after the Phase One agreement was reached, exports from other countries grew at even faster. As a result, the US market share of China’s agricultural imports is now smaller than it was before the trade war: 17% in approximately the first year of Phase One compared with 20% in calendar year 2017, according to the USDA.\n\nThere are non-tariff barriers to trade imposed by China as well. Commercial Chinese buyers need government approval to import US soybeans.\n\n“Importers in China have to jump through hoops to get access to US soybeans. There’s clearly a cost to doing business,” Glauber said.\n\nBut trade issues have taken a back seat to other more pressing worries for farmers, according to the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer. In April, 42% of producers said higher input costs are their top concern.\n\nWhile Walton remains frustrated with the Biden administration’s lack of action on trade, he also said he is worried about rising costs, especially for herbicide.\n\n“I’ve seen some instances where the price of herbicide has doubled or tripled. … We didn’t get our first choice, but we finally got an herbicide we can use to protect our crop,” Walton said.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/06/18/senate-crypto-bill-ruben-gallego/83826891007/", "title": "Senate passes big crypto bill with help from Sen.

The milk was trucked to Plymouth, made into 1-ounce sticks of mozzarella, put on pallets for a road trip to the West Coast, loaded onto a ship for a three-week voyage across the Pacific Ocean and delivered to the Smile Mini Mart in Phnom Penh, less than a mile from the Mekong River.\n\nThe Sargento cheese sits next to a couple of other expats from Wisconsin: Crystal Farms Pepper Jack from Lake Mills and Hoffman’s Super-Sharp Cheddar from Weyauwega.\n\nThe modest display in the booming city of 2 million shows Wisconsin’s reach into Southeast Asia, where U.S. dairy exports climbed to $771 million in 2018, making it the second-largest export market behind Mexico.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"When you start seeing Wisconsin products in countries like Cambodia, that's a big deal because it's such a new market,\" said Michael Stone, president of the Stone Group, a food exporter in Green Bay.\n\nMarketing the dairy industry: Farmers, animal activists want to know how $900 million for marketing was spent\n\nIt should be validation for Wisconsin’s relentless push to make dairy farms more productive and take advantage of what Gov. Scott Walker said in 2012 were “the opportunities that are here before us” on the international market.\n\nWisconsin is not alone on store shelves in Cambodia or anywhere else. Although the state is the leading cheese exporter in the USA, and dairy exports nationally have more than quadrupled in the past 15 years, the security many farmers hoped to see from the global marketplace remains elusive.\n\nOther big dairy producers, such as New Zealand and the European Union, have ramped up production and aggressively pursued exports – hoping that foreign markets, especially Asia, would be their lifeline as well.\n\n“We couldn’t all increase production and expect to find a willing buyer for it,” said Jim Goodman, a third-generation dairy farmer from Wonewoc.\n\nDairy has become dominated by multinational corporations such as Nestle, Saputo, Danone and Kraft-Heinz. The top 20 processors account for up to 30% of the milk produced worldwide, according to a study by the European Research Council.\n\nPolitics has added another challenge. In the first half of this year, U.S. dairy exports to China fell 54%, largely from the trade war that’s engulfed scores of American industries.\n\nLost sales in China are predicted to cost U.S. dairy farmers $12.2 billion by 2023 if the tariffs – as high as 45% on some products – remain in place, according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council.\n\n“Nobody can tell you, with any degree of certainty, when things are going to return to normal with China. It may be that never happens, or at least not in the foreseeable future,” said Tom Vilsack, CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council and the U.S. secretary of agriculture under President Barack Obama.\n\nStone, who ships cheese, cranberries and other Wisconsin foods to more than 60 countries, said he’s lost nearly all the China cheese business he painstakingly built over 15 years. Even if the trade war ended tomorrow, there’s no assurance that Stone – and others like him – could recover those sales.\n\n“All it’s done is hurt U.S. producers,” he said.\n\nThough Wisconsin dairy has a more international presence, it’s also more vulnerable to global economic forces.\n\nAbout 16% of U.S. dairy products are sold abroad, and at times that's enough to tip the whole industry. The heritage of America’s Dairyland – farm families milking 50 to 100 cows – might not be sustainable in a business climate where the world is awash in milk and trade wars torpedo sales and prices for years at a time.\n\nWisconsin has been losing dairy farms at the rate of more than two a day, most of them small, family-run operations. Many of those farmers have been hemorrhaging money – or barely breaking even – for nearly five years. The loss of those farms, and the impact on businesses and communities that rely on a farm economy, isn’t likely to be reversed.\n\n“A lot of people say that’s the way capitalism works, which I suppose is true,” said Goodman, who quit dairy farming after more than 40 years. \"But you also have to look at what it’s done to rural communities.”\n\nDairy operations connected globally\n\nThough it's highly perishable if not refrigerated within a few hours, milk has a shelf life of years when processed into cheese, and in powder form easily flows across borders.\n\nThere is no single world price for milk, but the prices paid to farmers are influenced by global supply and demand. A drought in one country, a trade fight in another, a food safety scandal – they can all have a domino effect that ultimately hurts or helps a farmer in central Wisconsin.\n\n“Today, dairying has become a footloose industry with supply chains spanning the globe. ... In an integrated global industry, the fortunes of dairy farmers everywhere are interconnected,” a European Research Council study said in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, Russia banned dairy imports from the European Union, the USA, Canada, Norway and Australia in retaliation for trade sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been the top importer of EU cheese, and the ban shook the global dairy network.\n\nThen in early 2015, the European Union lifted milk production quotas, a system that had been in place for 30 years, releasing a flood of dairy products onto the world market.\n\nComplicating things further, China realized it had been importing too much milk powder used in processed foods, infant formula and other products. China pulled back; sales plummeted.\n\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a move that Purdue University economists estimated would cost dairy $1 billion in export opportunities.\n\nAlso in 2017, Canada slashed imports of ultra-filtered milk, a high-protein concentrate used in cheese making. Scores of dairy farms in Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York and Vermont were left without a milk buyer. Trump vowed to intervene.\n\nIn 2018, China slapped steep tariffs on U.S. dairy. It sharply cut purchases of whey, a milk product used in livestock feed, after its hog farms were decimated by African swine fever.\n\n“The first case of African swine fever broke out just one month after retaliatory tariffs in August 2018,” said Corey Geiger, managing editor of Hoard’s Dairyman, a Fort Atkinson-based trade publication. “Since then, the incurable disease that leads to death in hogs has spread to every major Chinese province. The disease has also infected hogs in Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, South Korea and Vietnam.”\n\nThe moves by China cost Wisconsin farmers millions in lost sales.\n\nAsia, where much of the world’s dairy exporting has been focused, is a bellwether for globalization with its fast-growing economies and adoption of a more Western lifestyle.\n\n“I think that Asia offers a unique perspective because you can see the past, the present and the future all at the same time,” said Matt Einarson, the Southeast Asia biotechnology group director for Alltech, a livestock nutrition products company based in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nMexico imposed steep tariffs on U.S. dairy products in retaliation for tariffs Trump imposed on Mexican steel and aluminum. Normally, Mexico buys nearly a quarter of all U.S. dairy exports. The tariffs of 15% to 25% delivered a gut punch to an already hurting industry. Products that would have gone south of the border backed up across the country.\n\n“All of a sudden we have our hands full and the price absolutely stinks,” said Ken Heiman, general manager of Nasonville Dairy, a cheesemaker in Marshfield.\n\nSmall farms vulnerable elsewhere, too\n\nIn the Pak Chong District of northeast Thailand, where motorists yield to wild elephants sauntering across the highway, a dairy farmer balances two 13-gallon milk cans on the back of his motor scooter.\n\nIt’s a part of Thailand where Holstein dairy cattle graze in lush green pastures and family farms average 30 cows. It’s also a part of Thailand where the past and the present coexist – at least for now.\n\nThe farmer rolls into a milk depot not far from Khao Yai National Park, a vast wildlife sanctuary teeming with elephants, tigers, baboons and crocodiles.\n\nPrateep Kaewnun runs the depot and owns a 400-cow dairy farm built only a year ago. He wants to see the farmers on motorbikes continue in their livelihood.\n\n“It keeps happiness in families,” he said. “They can have a career and drink their own milk as well.”\n\nInside the facility, workers weigh the farmers’ milk and prepare it for shipment to processing centers. The equipment is modern, but the idea of small farms milking a few cows dates to 1960 when the king of Thailand, inspired by a visit to Denmark, decided to start a dairy industry.\n\n“We are very proud to be part of a project started by the king, to make dairy farming a sustainable career,” said Narongrit Wongsuwan, director-general of the Dairy Farming Promotion Organization of Thailand, based in Pak Chong.\n\n“These are family businesses that keep people in the countryside. The dairy farms are really important to the Thai people,” Wongsuwan said.\n\nHis organization runs a state-of-the-art dairy processing plant with equipment from the USA and Europe. It’s an impressive facility that produces bottled milk, yogurt and other products from milk that comes from local farms.\n\nNearby, there’s a dairy farm with 1,800 cows that has its own processing plant and 25 retail stores in Bangkok. That family-owned operation, Farm Chokchai, has a thriving tourism business with an American cowboy theme. It attracts a million visitors a year.\n\nThe Thai government urged farmers to modernize their operations before 2025, when tariffs will be lifted on dairy products coming from Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe small-scale Thai farms may not be able to compete with the big operations in New Zealand, especially.\n\n\"We are very concerned about that. We have to improve the efficiency of our dairy farmers,” Wongsuwan said.\n\nSome farmers said it’s too far in the future to worry about now.\n\nThat frustrates Kaewnun.\n\n“It will be difficult for the small farms to survive if they don't work together,” he said.\n\nAcross the Bay of Bengal, similar worries permeate India’s dairy industry – along with a similar reason for concern: foreign exports.\n\nAbout 75 million Indian households are engaged in dairy farming, according to official estimates, providing essential income for small farms and the rural poor. India is the world’s biggest milk producer, ahead of the USA, New Zealand, China, even the entire European Union, although more than half of the milk comes from buffalo, not cows.\n\nFarmers fear that a major Asia-Pacific trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, would encourage imports of cheaper agricultural products, including dairy.\n\nIf the deal is passed, farmers said, it could trigger a wave of milk products from New Zealand, a nation that has more cows than people and sells 90% of its milk abroad. It would be disastrous for millions of people who milk only a couple of cows or buffalo and rely on that income, Indian farmer Kannaiyan Subramaniam said.\n\n“We have an impressive network of individual sellers, cooperatives, others who have made our country self-sufficient in milk. It’s an excellent model that should be replicated in other developing countries,” he said in a Skype interview.\n\nNew Zealand said it would not send more than 5% of its milk supply to India, but that’s of little comfort to Subramaniam.\n\n“If we lose that much to one country alone, imagine the danger if we add up others,” he said.\n\nMade-to-order dairy industries\n\nWhile farmers in Thailand and India worry about imports crushing local markets and destroying small farms, in Vietnam and China the focus is on building mega-size operations to satisfy unmet dairy needs.\n\nAbout 150 miles south of Hanoi, TH Milk runs a $1.2 billion dairy operation tucked into the tropical landscape near Vietnam’s north-central coast. It is a mix of traditional Asian culture and modern technology.\n\nEven the road leading to the farm reflects the convergence of old and new: Farmers walk their buffalo between pastures as SUV drivers patiently wait to go around them. Clusters of barns – vast open-air metal buildings – house about 40,000 cattle in sweltering tropical heat. A system of sprinklers and fans gives the animals some relief.\n\nInside one of the barns, workers glue balls of mugwort, a medicinal herb, to acupressure points on cows’ backs. They light the mugwort on fire to release its properties, aimed at increasing fertility. The cows don’t even flinch as the smoldering herb penetrates their hide.\n\nTH Milk is the culmination of a pursuit by Thai Huong, a wealthy Vietnamese banker who said her country should have its own fresh milk supply.\n\nHer vision arose from a food safety scandal in which melamine, an organic compound used to make plastics, was intentionally added to watered-down milk in China to fool a test for protein and fetch a higher price. At least six babies died, and thousands of children were sickened. Dairy producers were found to be the culprit, and 14 people went to prison, one of them for life.\n\nAfter learning that children in Vietnam fell ill from imports of the adulterated milk, Huong partnered with Afimilk, an Israeli dairy technology company familiar with the challenges of milking cows in tropical climates, to create a farm in a part of Vietnam where she was born. Huong essentially bought a brand-new dairy operation much like a manufacturer might buy a turn-key factory.\n\nTH Milk accounts for much of the fresh milk produced in Vietnam, a fast-growing nation where the median age is 30 and dairy products have just gotten a foothold in many places.\n\nThe privately held company is a model of globalism.\n\nIt imported Holstein-Friesian cattle from the USA and New Zealand and technology from around the world. The cows took a while to adjust to the tropics and a new farm where workers were learning on the job.\n\n“This was a very different world for them,” said Craig Tannen, an Australian and the farm’s chief veterinarian.\n\nThe farm milks hundreds of cows at a time. Classical music is piped into the milking parlor, and there’s a herbal garden next to a barn that houses cows used to produce organic milk. There’s a Buddha statue where fresh dairy product offerings are left daily.\n\nThe feed mill, which produces 500,000 tons of cattle feed a year, is run by Hanan Saggi, an Israeli who came to Vietnam nearly a decade ago for the challenge of starting the farming operation and never left. He’s an energetic man in his 50s, who at age 26 was director of the largest dairy farm in Israel.\n\n“I never thought I would be in Vietnam this long, but it’s an amazing country, and I have an amazing job,\" he said. \"We are really proud of what we have achieved.”\n\nThe farm has more than 1,000 employees, a laboratory where 20,000 samples of milk a month are tested for quality and its own dairy processing plant.\n\nVietnam can’t satisfy its own dairy needs. It spent $258 million on imported dairy products in the first three months of 2019, up 11% from a year earlier.\n\nBut TH Milk is determined to reduce its country’s reliance on powdered milk, a product that people associate with developing nations.\n\n“We believe that once milk is converted to powder, it loses some of the nutritional value,” said Vijay Kumar Pandey, the farm’s chief financial officer and a native of India.\n\nTH Milk has its own dairy product brands and retail stores. The farm's long-range plan calls for 137,000 cows and it has opened a $2.7 billion dairy operation in Russia.\n\nHuong has launched schools, hospitals and pharmacies in Vietnam. Her farm is run as a business, but Pandey insists there’s a higher calling to satisfy nutritional needs in the nation where stunted growth in children remains an issue.\n\n“Profit will never be a big driver for us,” he said. “Our goal is to associate the brand with health and not just be a commodity and another milk product on the shelf.”\n\nLooking further ahead, the company is positioning itself to be an exporter.\n\n“The door to China is open for us,” Pandey said.\n\nAny discussion of the growing globalism of the dairy industry sooner or later turns to China.\n\nIn China, \"The small farms are going away, just like they are pretty much everywhere,” said James Cullor, a University of California-Davis veterinary sciences professor who has made roughly 50 trips to Chinese dairy farms over the past 20 years.\n\nBy 2022, China is expected to overtake the USA as the world’s largest dairy product market, according to the research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nThe country creates some of the most massive dairy farms on the planet. Scores of operations with thousands of cows each have been built in places where farms once housed a couple of cows, some pigs, chickens, goats and maybe a few geese.\n\nCullor said China’s biggest dairy processors aim to control the farms and flow of milk in their country and have set their sights on the global industry as well.\n\n“One of the reasons I started going over there was to try and figure out what their strategy was,” he said. “And I have been telling the California dairy industry that China is going to come here, they’re going to buy farms, processing plants and they’re going to learn how to beat you at your own game.”\n\nNo reversing global economy\n\nTwenty years ago, China’s dairy industry barely existed. It was willing to pay the University of Wisconsin-Madison and many others for education and expertise. Today, dairy exporters to China are increasingly competing with home-produced milk.\n\n“When I first started promoting dairy in China, they mostly had very small stakeholders, people with one or two cows in their backyard,” said Karen Nielsen, program outreach manager for the dairy science department at UW-Madison.\n\nOther countries have been able to leapfrog their way to dairy success, partly by tapping into the latest technologies and bovine genetics from Wisconsin, New Zealand and Europe.\n\nIn the first week of October, about 70,000 people from more than two dozen countries are expected to descend on Madison for the World Dairy Expo. Held at the Alliant Energy Center, the annual event showcases the latest in dairy technology – and at least indirectly celebrates Wisconsin’s historical role in its evolution.\n\nThe expo is part convention, part livestock show, part classroom.\n\nVirtual tours of the best farm operations take place not far from rows of commercial exhibits. In the coliseum, cows saunter down a runway of colored wood shavings meant to look like a red carpet, all under the watchful eyes of judges wearing tuxedos. Education sessions focus on everything from improving dairy feed to managing manure.\n\nThis year, woven into that schedule are seminars that address the crossroads dairy operators find themselves at:\n\n• Growing Your Business for Generations to Come – Are We Shaping the Right Model?\n\n• What Drives Financial Success on a Dairy\n\n• Understanding the Stressors on Today's Dairy Farms\n\n• Dairy Farm Financial Decision-Making in Turbulent Times\n\nWorld Dairy Expo illustrates the fact there's no reversing the global economy. Wisconsin exported $451 million in dairy products in 2018, according to a report from Steven Deller, a UW-Madison agricultural economist.\n\n\"One of the primary sources of growth for the agricultural industry has been foreign export markets, particularly new markets that are opening in Asia,\" Deller said.\n\nThe question is whether Wisconsin's dairy industry can find enough opportunity – in Asia and around the globe – to recalibrate when the percentage of farms shutting down has reached heights not seen since the Great Depression.\n\nFrom the USA to Cambodia\n\nIn Cambodia, a 15-minute ferry ride across the Mekong River from the bustling Phnom Penh business district, a young American from Salt Lake City, Utah, operates the country’s only commercial dairy farm.\n\nMoo Moo Farms, which has 150 Holstein-Friesian cattle, boasts its own milk bottling plant and a drive-up store for customers navigating heavy city traffic on motor scooters.\n\nIts owner is Kenny Matthews, 30, a former Mormon missionary who finished high school in Bangkok while his father worked at the U.S. Embassy there.\n\nWhile doing mission work in Cambodia, Matthews said, it struck him as odd that the country didn’t have its own dairy farms. Fresh milk – what little was available – came from Thailand or Vietnam. And the milk made from imported powder mixed with water wasn’t very tasty.\n\n“I stopped drinking milk when I came to Southeast Asia,” he said. “It just didn’t taste like milk to me.”\n\nMatthews said he had no farming experience when he launched Moo Moo Farms a couple of years ago. The only time he had ever milked a cow was when he was 12 years old back in Utah.\n\nHe started the farm on a very small scale with cows imported from Thailand and milking equipment from New Zealand.\n\n“I made a lot of mistakes, but when you start with only 11 cows, your mistakes aren’t as detrimental,” he said.\n\nWith help from his father and outside investors, Matthews has grown Moo Moo Farms to an operation that supplies fresh milk to restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops and other customers in Phnom Penh. He’s working to get city folks familiar with a dairy farm. Moo Moo Farms hosts tourists and student groups and is putting in a petting zoo, ice cream parlor and cafe.\n\nMatthews hopes to double the size of his herd to 300 cows by the end of the year. He wants to get fresh milk into school lunch programs and, long term, he would love to supply rural areas where refrigeration is spotty.\n\nMoo Moo Farms is hardly a global player; arguably, it’s not even a national player. It has less than 1% of the market share for milk in Cambodia and is hardly a household name. But considering Matthews’ willingness to take risks, his knowledge of the culture and his missionary zeal, it’s not hard to imagine a day when those dairy shelves at the Smile Mini Mart will include his products alongside the Sargento string cheese.\n\n“It’s either ambitious or crazy,” Matthews said of his attempt to take a seat at the international table, “and there’s probably a fine line between the two of them.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/02"}]}

This announcement comes as Newark Liberty International Airport continues to deal with an uptick in delays and cancellations after an equipment outage the week before, during which Newark air traffic controllers lost contact with aircraft for 30 seconds.\n\nThe disruptions at Newark Airport have caused immense frustration, leaving travelers stranded or delayed for several hours. Gov. Phil Murphy sent a letter to Duffy asking for technology and facility upgrades, urging him to make the New Jersey area a priority in any efforts to improve the air traffic control system.\n\nOn May 8, Duffy held a press conference to announce his plans for a total replacement of the nationwide air traffic control system.\n\n\"The plan to do a brand-new redo of air traffic control has never existed,\" said Duffy, who went on to describe the current decades-old system, which he said uses outdated copper wires and radar from the 1970s and '80s.\n\n\"It's important to recognize what you have and what you need. So you look at how this functions, I think Newark has been a great example of when this old infrastructure goes down. What happened in Newark is that main communication line went down ... the backup line didn't fire, and so we had that 30 to 90 seconds of a blackout, which is frightening,\" Duffy said. \"If we don't actually accomplish the mission that we're announcing [May 8], you will see Newarks not just in Newark, you'll see Newarks in other parts of the country, because it's an aging system. And so we have to actually upgrade it.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Duffy's plans to replace the current air traffic control system and the proposed timeline.\n\nReplacing the nationwide air traffic control system\n\nDuffy's proposal calls for a total replacement of the nationwide air traffic control system, from replacing critical technology to building new towers. Some key actions, the U.S. Transportation Department said, are:\n\nReplacing antiquated telecommunications with new fiber, wireless and satellite technologies at over 4,600 sites, 25,000 new radios and 475 new voice switches.\n\nReplacing 618 radars that have gone past their life cycle.\n\nAddressing runway safety by increasing the number of airports with Surface Awareness Initiative to 200.\n\nBuilding six new air traffic control centers, for the first time since the 1960s, and replacing towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities, or TRACONs.\n\nInstalling new modern hardware and software for all air traffic facilities to create a common platform system throughout towers, TRACONs and centers.\n\nAddressing the challenges that face Alaska by adding 174 new weather stations.\n\n\"In essence, all the front-facing equipment for controllers, all the back-end systems for controllers, all brand-new,\" Duffy said. \"All new hardware, all new software is going to be built into this brand-new air traffic control system.\"\n\nHe added that he aims to build a system that not only will be safe and efficient but also can be built upon and upgraded as new technology becomes available.\n\nTo read the full proposal, visit transportation.gov/briefing-room/brand-new-air-traffic-control-system-plan.\n\nDuffy says he aims to complete the rebuild in three to four years\n\nDuffy said at the press conference that he intends to build the new system in three to four years. However, for this to be accomplished, the money will need to be available upfront.\n\n\"One of the problems in the past is when you give small tranches of money year over year, politics change, leadership changes, presidents change, interest changes, and it never gets built,\" he said. \"So I am going to ask Congress for upfront appropriations to give us all of the money.\"\n\nDuffy plans to appear before Congress each quarter to provide an update on what has been built and how much has been spent. On top of that, he said, the department will need permitting reform to be able to build this new system quickly.\n\nUpgrades coming to Newark Airport\n\nIn an update on May 7, the Federal Aviation Administration said it is taking \"immediate steps to improve the reliability of operations\" at Newark Airport. These steps include accelerating technological and logistical improvements and increasing air traffic controller staffing.\n\nAt Newark Airport, an FAA system called STARS, which is based in New York, processes radar data. Telecommunications lines then feed the data from New York to the Philadelphia TRACON, where controllers handle arrivals and departures at Newark.\n\nThe FAA said the following plans are expected to be implemented in the coming weeks and months, and all by the of the year:\n\nAdding three new, high-bandwidth telecommunications connections between STARS and the Philadelphia TRACON to provide more speed, reliability and redundancy.\n\nReplacing copper communications connections with updated fiber-optic technology that also has greater bandwidth and speed.\n\nDeploying a temporary backup system to the Philadelphia TRACON that will provide redundancy during the switch to a more reliable fiber-optic network.\n\nEstablishing a STARS hub at the Philadelphia TRACON so the facility does not depend on a telecommunications feed from the New York STARS hub.\n\nIncreasing controller staffing.\n\n\"When staffing or equipment issues occur, the FAA will ensure safety by slowing the rate of arrival into the airport,\" said the agency's statement. \"We will continue to provide updates to the public as we work through these issues.\"\n\nDelays and cancellations continue at Newark Airport Thursday\n\nThis news comes after more than a week of disruptions at Newark Airport attributed to various factors including FAA equipment and staffing issues, runway construction and weather.\n\nA ground delay remained in place at Newark Airport on May 8, said the FAA, which reported an average delay of 49 minutes due to staffing.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNewark Air Traffic Control staffing\n\nAir Traffic Control staffing has been an issue in the U.S. for years. In a press conference last Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged that nationwide, the Federal Aviation Administration is short about 3,000 air traffic controllers. He said the DOT is working to boost hiring through a variety of initiatives, and to incentivize current controllers to avoid early retirement.\n\nStill, Duffy acknowledged, the issue can’t be resolved overnight.\n\n“We’re hoping in three to four years we can get to full staffing, not 20 years,” he said. “How do you make up the gap? We can’t snap our fingers to make up the numbers.\"\n\nThe problem has been particularly acute in New York City’s airspace, and the FAA has required airlines to reduce the number of flights to the metro. Beyond the capacity caps, there haven’t been other significant issues telegraphed at the city’s other two major airports so far this spring.\n\nThe agency also tried to address the issue partly by relocating some Newark controllers from a facility in New York to one in Philadelphia last year, but that came with its own array of issues, including ongoing equipment problems.\n\n“These challenges are not new to Newark. United has been urging the US government for *years* to use its authority to effectively limit the number of flights to what the airport can realistically handle,” Kirby said in his letter. “Past failure to make those changes had led to the circumstances that United and, most importantly, our customers now face.”\n\nOther major airports in New York – JFK and LaGuardia, are both slot controlled. United said it is voluntarily reducing its schedule at Newark, canceling 35 round-trip flights per day, to try to hedge against further disruptions.\n\nFAA equipment issues\n\nStaffing issues aside, outdated equipment has also led to issues for passengers and air traffic controllers.\n\n“In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed - resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and canceled flights and worst of all, thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans,” Kirby’s letter said. “Unfortunately, the technology issues were compounded as over 20% of the FAA controllers for EWR walked off the job.”\n\nIndustry advocates warned that these kind of equipment failures, which were already relatively common, would become more frequent amid DOGE cuts at the FAA. While the layoffs did not impact air traffic control tower personnel directly, and many of the probationary employees who were terminated were ultimately re-hired, the affected positions included maintenance personnel responsible for equipment upkeep, according to union representatives.\n\nDuffy said during the press conference last week that the FAA and DOT are planning a major announcement about new air traffic control equipment this week.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, May 5, the FAA said it is taking short-term steps to shore up its existing technology infrastructure and is working to speed up modernization projects.\n\n\"We are working to ensure the current telecommunications equipment is more reliable in the New York area by establishing a more resilient and redundant configuration with the local exchange carriers. In addition, we are updating our automation system to improve resiliency,\" the statement from the agency said.\n\nDuffy also acknowledged that the equipment issues were taking a toll on air traffic controllers who oversaw Newark, and said some staffers had taken time off to recover.\n\nWhat can travelers do?\n\nIf you’re flying through Newark in the coming weeks and months, it’s a good idea to prepare yourself for possible disruptions. Be patient with airport and airline employees if something goes wrong.\n\nBut also, try to book flights earlier in the day, which are less likely to be disrupted or canceled. Delays and cancellations often build up as the day goes on. If your flight does get delayed or canceled, it’s a good idea to look for alternative flights for rebooking yourself, and to work with the airline to get rerouted.\n\nUnfortunately, air traffic control and weather-related delays aren’t often considered issues that are in the airline’s control. The FAA acknowledged it sometimes has to direct airlines to reduce the number of flights at airports experiencing equipment issues as a safety precaution, so you may not be eligible for compensation if your flight is canceled or delayed, but ask your carrier’s customer service team what your options are if you find yourself stuck.\n\nThis story was updated to include new information and video.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

Their job is to navigate and ensure the safety of aircraft, pilots, and 2.9 million daily passengers in managing about 50,000 flights a day, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThere are over 14,000 air traffic control specialists in the country spread across over 400 locations, according to the FAA.\n\nHow much do air traffic control specialists make?\n\nThe approximate medianannual wage for air traffic control specialists is $127,805, according to the FAA.\n\nThe salaries for entree-level traffic control positions increase after the completion of every new training phase. Other factors determining the salary of a controller includes experience, location of the facility and the complexity of the airspace.\n\nAn air-traffic control specialist is a government employee that will receive benefits including retirement, insurance and spending options. Air traffic controllers are able to retire at age 50 with at least 20 years of service or any age with at least 25 years., said the FAA.\n\nThere are number of other aviation jobs including airway transportation systems specialists, aviation safety inspector and other jobs that support the aircraft system throughout the country.\n\nThe Trump administration laid off 400 FAA employees in February as part of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts. U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the layoffs included “zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel,\" though many who were laid off are part of keeping the aircraft system afloat.\n\nHow do you become an air control specialist?\n\nThose applying to become an air control specialist must meet a certain set of a requirements. A college degree is not required. A candidate can have at least one year work experience instead of both.\n\nThe list of qualifications listed on the FAA's website include:\n\nBe a United States citizen\n\nBe under the age of 31\n\nPass a medical examination\n\nPass a security investigation\n\nPass the FAA air traffic pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA)\n\nSpeak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment\n\nHave one year of progressively responsible work experience, or a bachelor's degree, or a combination of post-secondary education and work experience that totals one year\n\nAlong with those requirements, applicants must also pass a list of medical requirements in order to make sure the candidate is physically and mentally fit and meet standards for vision, hearing, cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric health, said the FAA. Applicants will go through a medical and background check as part of the process in qualifying for a position.\n\nThe application process in becoming an air traffic control specialist is five-step procedure, down from eight-steps to \"accelerate the time-to-hire for these critical positions by shaving more than four months off the old process,\" said the FAA. This is the process listed in the FAA's website.\n\nSubmit an application through USAJobs\n\nTake the Air Traffic Skills Assessment\n\nPass medical and security clearances\n\nReceive and accept offer\n\nBegin Academy training\n\nAll applicants must provide a resume or CV in their application. If the candidate is applying based on education, they must submit the official or unofficial transcripts.\n\nAir traffic collegiate training initiatives\n\nBefore applying to become an air traffic control specialist, a step in the process that is not required but crucial and recommended is participating in an Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) Partnership Program.\n\nThis program is a \"non-funded partnership between selected colleges and universities and the Federal Aviation Administration\" that produces a degree that specializes in specific air traffic curricula.\n\nThe attainment of a degree from this program does not guarantee employment, but \"collegiate aviation is considered a critical hiring source to meet the FAA's need for air traffic controllers now and in the future.\"\n\nThe schools that participate in the program offer two and four year non-engineering aviation degrees that teach courses in air traffic control and aviation administration.\n\nA list of schools that offer the CTI program are listed on the FAA website. No colleges in New Jersey offer, the program, but three in New York offer the degree, including Farmingdale State College.\n\nEven if you finish the program, you still still take and pass the Air Traffic Skills Assessment and meet medical and security requirements.\n\nAfter a candidate receives a job offer for an air traffic control specialist, the next step is to spend several months at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. The training at the academy is paid. If you took a CTI program, you can bypass the Air Traffic Basics Course, which is the first five weeks of qualification training at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.\n\nThere is still one to three years of on-the-job experience before one can become certified professional controller even after graduating the academy. The experience is still paid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2025/05/22/air-traffic-control-technology-ai/83627436007/", "title": "How AI, new tech could help address issues with air traffic control", "text": "AI-assisted summary Outdated technology and staffing shortages at Newark Liberty International Airport have led to ongoing flight delays and cancellations.\n\nExperts warn that underfunding the FAA has prevented necessary technological upgrades and hiring of air traffic controllers.\n\nThe Transportation Secretary proposed a program to modernize the system and incentivize hiring, but Congressional funding is still needed.\n\nOld technology is behind the spate of delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport, but newer technology will be an important part of the solution.\n\nTo recap, on April 28, air traffic controllers handling inbound traffic at Newark experienced a brief radar and radio outage. Similar failures have occurred at least three times since then, and in response, the Federal Aviation Administration and airlines have reduced the number of flights in and out of the airport.\n\nIt's the kind of failure experts have been warning was inevitable for years.\n\n“All these issues of staffing, all these issues of using copper wires instead of fiber optics, these have been there for a long time,” Sheldon Jacobson, professor of computer science at the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering, told USA TODAY.\n\nJacobson said the technology in air traffic control towers is largely outdated, but like an old car, it worked well until it started breaking down.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“People are now paying attention,\" he said. “They put more airplanes in the sky than the system can absorb, and what’s happened is we've reached a tipping point. We have so much volume, and we have pretty much the same air traffic control technology for decades.\"\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe FAA's air traffic control failures didn't develop overnight, although the headaches at Newark did catch many travelers by surprise.\n\nIndustry watchers have long warned that Congress was underfunding the FAA, preventing the agency from upgrading its technology and limiting its ability to hire and train new controllers.\n\nAccording to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the FAA is short about 3,000 air traffic controllers nationwide and continues to rely on outdated technology like floppy disks to perform some crucial functions.\n\nStill, Jacobson said, that doesn't mean air travel isn't safe.\n\n“The FAA, the airlines, and all of the supporting people have worked diligently to make air travel safer, and it’s never been safer,\" he said. And that's part of the reason there are more delays and cancellations as air traffic control equipment falters.\n\n\"The only way to ensure the safety is to bring the volume down so we're not at that tipping point,\" Jacobson said.\n\nWhat solutions have been proposed?\n\nSuccessive administrations from both parties in Washington have promised fixes to the FAA's air traffic control program, but the solutions have been piecemeal so far.\n\nDuffy recently announced a sweeping program to upgrade the agency's technology infrastructure, as well as hiring incentives to entice more would-be controllers.\n\nBut a funding commitment from Congress was missing from his announcement. That hurdle has prevented previous administrations from implementing such overhauls.\n\nEven if lawmakers fund the Trump administration's proposals, implementing the upgrades probably will take years.\n\n“This isn’t going to happen in three years. This is going to take several years,” Jacobson said. “It’s expensive and time-consuming.”\n\nHe also warned that the overhaul will add expense, complexity and time because the upgrades will need to be rolled out without taking the existing system offline.\n\n“You’re trying to update a system while it’s still working,\" he said.\n\nCan AI help solve air traffic control failures?\n\nEventually, the FAA will roll out new technology for air traffic control, and while Jacobson said air traffic controllers won't ever be fully replaced by computers, he did acknowledge that new tech has a role to play in optimizing the nation's airspace.\n\n“If we leave that off the table, we’re forcing ourselves to use more manpower,\" he said.\n\nJacobson said that because the FAA and airlines prioritize safety above all else, it doesn't make sense to remove humans from the air traffic control equation entirely. Pilots unions have also long stressed the importance of having two highly trained aviators in the cockpit of every commercial flight, despite growing calls from some outside groups to explore flight control automation. But using artificial intelligence and other technology to ease controllers' burden actually could make the system safer.\n\n“There are a lot of very perfunctory tasks that, working with ATC, an AI system could direct airplanes to,\" Jacobson said, such as issuing initial clearance for pilots to push back from their gates or guiding them to the taxiway.\n\n\"You don’t compromise safety. That is the most important objective, but you're giving them a little more breathing room or legroom to get their job done.\"\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

The report called for the agency to take \"urgent action\" and noted that the FAA has been \"slow to modernize.\"\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/10/sean-duffy-nasa-interim-administrator-trump/84529891007/", "title": "Sean Duffy is Trump pick for NASA interim head", "text": "NASA has found itself without a full-time administrator since Bill Nelson stepped down on Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nDuffy's appointment also comes after billionaire Jared Isaacman's nomination fell through in May.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy is about to perform double duty after President Donald Trump named him to lead NASA on an interim basis.\n\nNews of Duffy's appointment comes during a turbulent period in NASA's history, as the U.S. space agency faces potentially steep budget cuts and has grappled with workforce reductions. What's more, NASA has found itself without a full-time administrator since Bill Nelson stepped down on Jan. 20, the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump, though, gave Duffy a glowing vote of confidence when announcing his new appointment.\n\n“He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday, July 9.\n\nHere's everything to know about Duffy, the former Wisconsin Republican Congressman and reality TV star who will lead the world's largest space agency.\n\nTrump picks transportation secretary Sean Duffy for NASA acting administrator\n\nDuffy will serve as the interim administrator of NASA as the Trump administration continues to search for a candidate to formally take over the post for the rest of the president's term.\n\n“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country’s Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"Congratulations, and thank you, Sean.\"\n\nIn his own post on X shortly after the president's announcement, Duffy said he is “honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let’s launch.\n\nWho is Sean Duffy? What to know about NASA's new head\n\nDuffy, 53, was confirmed Jan. 28 by the Senate as U.S. transportation secretary.\n\nHis tenure was immediately marked by tragedy after a fatal aviation crash near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people\n\nAt his confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, Duffy said he would prioritize adding more air traffic controllers to improve aviation safety while promising to work with Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates Boeing, to restore international confidence in the plane manufacturer after fatal crashes overseas.\n\nPrior to serving in the Trump Administration, Duffy represented Wisconsin in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019.\n\nBut long before his political career, Duffy was a reality television star. He began his television career on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" during its sixth season and even met his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, who hosts “Fox & Friends Weekend,\" while filming for an MTV show.\n\nDuffy to replace Janet Petro\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, NASA has been led by Acting Administrator Janet Petro.\n\nA veteran NASA executive, Petro will step down from her role to make way for Duffy, the New York Times reported.\n\nWhy did Trump drop Jared Isaacman as NASA nominee?\n\nBillionaire Jared Isaacman, who has been to space twice under missions he bankrolled with SpaceX, had been Trump's first pick to lead NASA.\n\nIsaacman’s nomination was well-received by most of the space community and members of Congress.\n\nBut at a critical time when the U.S. space agency is preparing to return humans to the moon and send the first astronauts to Mars, Trump suddenly pulled Isaacman's bid in late-May. The decision came after Isaacman had cleared the Senate Commerce Committee in April and appeared on track for a full Senate vote.\n\nTrump discussed Isaacman's nomination July 6 in a long social media post bashing his former ally and advisor Elon Musk, saying he thought it would have been “inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon … run NASA.”\n\nTrump further said of Isaacman that he \"was surprised to learn that he was a blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"\n\nIsaacman pushed back against Trump's claims in a post Monday, July 7 on X, describing himself as an apolitical \"right-leaning moderate.\"\n\nCould more than 2,000 senior employees quit at NASA?\n\nDuffy is set to take over an agency that has undergone workforce reductions and is preparing for a potential massive looming budget cut.\n\nTrump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year would slash NASA funding by nearly 25% – from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion – mostly by eliminating a significant portion of the agency's science portfolio.\n\nAnd on July 10, news broke that around 2,145 senior-ranking employees at NASA are set to leave under a push to shed staff, Politico reported, citing documents obtained by the news outlet. Most employees leaving are in senior-level government positions, the report said, adding that the agency has offered staff early retirement, buyouts and deferred resignations.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

The firm secured settlements for families of victims in the nation's last major air disaster, the 2009 crash of a Continental Airlines flight in Buffalo that killed 50 people.\n\nPublic comments by Trump, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth could make their cases stronger if families of victims in this week's crash move forward, according to partners with New York-based Kreindler & Kreindler.\n\n“Duffy basically says: We’re not going to run away from it, we’ll own it, and the president has made statements about the Army helicopter pilot who messed up,” said Justin Green a partner at the firm. “It’ll be interesting to see how the government and this administration handles any efforts to resolve this case. It’s within their power to direct claims be paid swiftly.”\n\nThe apparent acceptance of responsibility is a departure from past lawsuits, where government agencies are ultra-cautious about liability and assigning blame, Green said. The transcripts and social media posts are already “part of the fabric of the case,” and could be introduced as evidence, he said.\n\nIt wouldn’t be new territory for Trump, whose tweets in 2017 were notably used by the 9th Circuit of Appeals to block the travel ban imposed on majority Muslim countries. Earlier this week, a federal judge cited tweets made by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when he issued a restraining order against a pause in federal grants and loans.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that collided with the American Eagle regional passenger jet was to blame for the accident, flying too high. Helicopters flying near Reagan are capped at 200 feet to avoid aircraft.\n\n“It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nAt the White House Thursday, Hegseth appeared to say the Defense Department would take responsibility for the crash, “no excuses, we’re going to get to the bottom of this… it never should have happened.”\n\n“Tragically, last night, a mistake was made… and there was some sort of an elevation issue we’re investigating at the DOD and Army level,” Hegseth said.\n\nRepresentatives from the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nLawsuits could target FAA, DOD, American\n\nThe aviation disaster firm Kreindler also represents victims in the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse and Boeing 737 MAX lawsuits from the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed 157 people in 2019.\n\nGreen said the families “have full legal rights and almost certainly will make recoveries in settlements or at trial” against the Federal Aviation Administration for alleged negligence by air traffic controllers and the Department of Defense for any negligence by pilots of the helicopter.\n\n“The two areas that are most ripe for potential accidents in our aviation safety system are the training and qualifications of the flight crew, which was the focus in Buffalo, and now, air traffic control similarly being undermanned and overcast,” said Dan Rose, another Kreindler partner. “Everybody knew for two decades a ground incursion or midair collision was the most likely soft spot and nothing was done. I expect changes will be made as a result.”\n\nTo seek damages from the federal government, litigants must file a notice of claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Then they’d have to wait to see if the government declines the claim, or wait six months to file the official lawsuit. It would then be decided by a judge, rather than a jury.\n\n“It’s premature, but we know each family has very substantial claims, the law looks at the economic damages as in the loss for the survivors and their support, the mortgage can’t get paid and kids can’t go to college,” Green said. “Then more importantly, the non-economic side: The emotional harm, and the suffering of their survivors. Each case is litigated individually.”\n\nAttorneys will also examine options to sue American Airlines and its subsidiary PSA Airlines if they identify any suspected negligence by their pilots. And they’ll probe the onboard traffic alerting equipment to ensure they were functional and up to design standards.\n\nD.C. lawsuits won't wait for NTSB conclusions\n\nInvestigators for the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday their preliminary investigation into the crash will take a month and a final report would not be complete for a year or more.\n\nBut that won’t stop civil litigation either against American Airlines and its subsidiaries or the federal government.\n\nAttorneys will instead rely on publicly available flight recorder data, media reports and likely hire their own forensic researchers to build a case.\n\nFinal NTSB \"probable cause\" conclusions generally aren't admissible in court, but the facts the board gathers to come to those conclusions are admissible, said Jason Matzus of Matzus Law in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe’s handling a lawsuit stemming from the collapse of Pittsburgh's Fern Hollow Bridge in 2022, which injured 10. He successfully introduced facts from an NTSB investigation into his lawsuit last year.\n\nAnother vital piece of the lawsuits will be calculating damages, for which Matzus said firms will rely on forensic economists.\n\n“Were they a stay-at-home parent or the primary breadwinner?” Matzus said. “Parents will also be able to make claims for their children and estimate their earnings over their life based on the parents’ educational background and earning history.”\n\nBut the non-economic damages in the plane crash are more important, Matzus said.\n\n“Claims will be significant. It’s premature, but conservatively speaking these will be multimillion dollar claims each,” he said. “And the life cycle of a case in this type of situation is several years.”\n\nNick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

On Tuesday, Texas voters will help choose the next U.S. president, a U.S. Senator, and candidates for various federal, state and local offices on the general election ballot.\n\nFollow along for live updates and results for key national, statewide and local races:\n\n12:15 p.m. update: Races called for competitive South Texas seats\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen won reelection against his Trump-backed challenger, former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Los Indios, by 3 percentage points in the race for District 34.\n\nNext door, Republican U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz blew out Democratic opponent Michelle Vallejo by 14 points to win a second term in House District 15.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nAustin City Council election results\n\nIt remains unclear if incumbent Kirk Watson will avoid a runoff in his bid for a second, consecutive term for mayor of Austin. Unofficial results from Travis, Hays and Williamson counties show Watson has secured 50.01% of the vote — barely above the 50% threshold needed to win the five-way race outright.\n\nWhile that includes the vast majority of ballots cast, a spokesman for the Travis County Clerk said the office can accept military and overseas ballots through next week. Totals could also change during the certification process.\n\nIn case of a runoff, Watson would have to face off against the second-highest vote-getter, community organizer Carmen Llanes Pullido, who received 20.1% of the vote.\n\nDistrict 2\n\nAustin City Council incumbent Vanessa Fuentes, whose District 2 opponent did not actively campaign, secured a second term in a landslide on Tuesday, complete but unofficial results show.\n\nFuentes received 85.65% of the vote while her opponent, Robert Reynolds, received 14.35%, Travis County election results show.\n\nDistrict 4\n\nIncumbent City Council member José “Chito” Vela, who faced four challengers, won reelection Tuesday with 58.5% of the vote, according to the unofficial final results.\n\nThe most promising challenger, community organizer Monica Guzmán, came in second with 27.72% of the vote.\n\nDistrict 6\n\nKrista Laine is leading conservative incumbent District 6 City Council Member Mackenzie Kelly by around 2.5 percentage point, according to unofficial final results from Travis and Williamson counties. The final results have yet to be certified, and the clerk can accept overseas and military ballots until next week.\n\nDistrict 7\n\nCivil rights lawyers Mike Siegel and Gary Bledsoe are headed to a runoff to represent the north Austin district. District 7’s current representative, Leslie Pool, could not seek reelection because of the city’s term limits.\n\nSiegel won 39.83% of the vote and Bledsoe received 19.29% support, but, with four other candidates in the race, no candidate cleared the majority threshold needed to avoid a runoff. They will face off at the ballot box again on Dec. 14.\n\nDistrict 10\n\nBusiness owner Marc Duchen is barely leading the District 10 race with 50.62% of the vote. His opponent, Ashika Ganguly, received 49.38% support, according to unofficial final results in Travis County. Final results have yet to be certified, and the clerk can accept overseas and military ballots until next week.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\nAISD voters approve higher tax rate\n\nAustin school district voters on Tuesday approved a tax rate election to raise the property tax rate by 9.1 cents to inject another $41 million into the district’s budget at a time when it’s facing a $119 million deficit — an investment school officials say will stave off the most painful cuts.\n\nVoters decisively approved the tax hike with 58% of the 305,254 votes cast, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nIn passing Proposition A, voters agreed to raise their school tax rate from 85.95 cents per $100 of property valuation to 95.05 cents, a cost of about $420 annually for an average-value Austin homeowner.\n\nThe higher rate will raise $171 million total, but only $41 million will go to Austin schools. The other $130 million will go to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture. The program functions as a “Robin Hood,” taking tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nThe district has pledged to spend $17.8 million of the new revenue to raise salaries for teachers and other staff members, particularly for those who are mid- to advanced-career level. Another $3 million will go to hiring instructional aids and the rest will be used pay down the district’s deficit.\n\nSchool board races\n\nIn the District 2 school board race, LaRessa Quintana beat out Sarah Ivory with 60.9% of the 20,479 votes, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nFernando Lucas de Urioste and Lindsey Stringer will face off in a runoff election for the District 8, at-large seat after no candidate won a majority but whittled down the six-person field of contenders.\n\nDe Urioste was the top vote-getter with almost 32.5% of the 200,412 votes cast, according to complete but unofficial results.\n\nStringer narrowly slid into the runoff with almost 26% of the votes, beating Amy Moore, who got 23.7%. The remaining candidates — Dylan “Sky” MacAdams, Nathaniel Hellman and Nick Franke — received 8.7%, 5.7% and 3.6% of the vote, respectively.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n1:55 a.m. update: Democrats fail to flip San Antonio seats in school voucher fight\n\nIn close and wildly expensive races, Republicans maintained control of two San Antonio seats that Democrats had sought to flip in the Texas House.\n\nIn a 52-48 victory, state Rep. John Lujan, a former sheriff's deputy and firefighter, won a third term representing House District 118. Lujan defeated Kristian Carranza, a Democratic legislative staffer who made abortion rights and public school funding central to her campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, criminal defense attorney Marc LaHood secured a 6 percentage point margin of victory against Laurel Jordan Swift for House District 121, according to the final but unofficial election results. He became the GOP nominee after Abbott helped him oust incumbent Rep. Steve Allison, R-San Antonio, in the primary. Allison, who encountered Abbott's wrath for opposing school vouchers, endorsed Swift.\n\nLaHood also took donations from the Texans for a United Conservative Majority, a political action committee funded by Christian nationalists Tim Dunn and Ferris Wilks.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:30 a.m. update: GOP nominee Adam Hinojosa ousts state Sen. Morgan LaMantia\n\nIn the only competitive race in the Texas Senate, Republican Adam Hinojosa ousted Democratic state Sen. Morgan LaMantia in District 27 in the Rio Grande Valley, according to the final but unofficial results.\n\n“The people of this district have rejected the woke absurdity of the left — open borders, boys playing girls sports, sex change operations, and fiscal insanity,\" Hinojosa said in a statement declaring victory just before midnight Tuesday.\n\n--Bayliss Wagner\n\n1:15 a.m. update: Voters pick ACC board trustees\n\nSherri Lynn Taylor has secured the Place 7 seat on the Austin Community College Board of Trustees, a seat left vacant by Barbara Mink, a founding member of the district and current board chair who is retiring after 24 years on the board, according to the complete but unofficial election results from eligible parts of the six counties who elect the seats at-large.\n\nTaylor came out ahead with 57.55% of the vote against ACC alum Cole Wilson, who has campaigned since January and secured endorsements from the Travis County Democratic Party, multiple council members and state senators. Taylor does not have a searchable campaign website or campaign email.\n\nIn the race for the Place 9 seat, incumbent Julie Ann Nitsch, another ACC alum who has served on the board since 2016 pushing for holistic student support and resources, was handily ahead of challenger Joseph Sefton, the newly retired ACC chief information officer who ran on a platform of adding a greater tech focused perspective to the board. Nitsch secured 70.6% of the votes, according to the unofficial results.\n\nIncumbent Stephanie Gharakhanian, an attorney who has held the seat since 2018, ran unopposed for the Place 8 seat.\n\nACC seats are elected at-large. Trustees are tasked with representing the district and meeting the community’s needs. Results are not official until the counties and ACC trustees certify them.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n1:10 a.m. update: US Rep. Henry Cuellar reelected despite indictment\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a 20-year congressional veteran who is considered among the most conservative Democrats in the U.S. House, defeated Republican retired naval officer Jay Furman in a district anchored by the border city of Laredo in South Texas.\n\nCuellar, a proven vote-getter who was elected to the Texas House eight times before winning his first election to Congress in 2004, was made vulnerable after a federal indictment in May accused him and his wife of accepting $600,000 in bribes and money laundering.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges the money came from Azerbaijan’s state-operated oil and gas company. The Cuellars have insisted that they are innocent of the charges, but Furman had run late-campaign ads accusing Cuellar of using his office “to enrich himself and empower cartels.”\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n1 a.m. update: Travis County's Proposition A set to pass, final results show\n\nTravis County is poised to become the first county in Texas to help low-income families pay for childcare after voters showed overwhelming support for Proposition A on Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which is set to pass with about 60% of the vote (provisional ballots still need to be counted), calls for a 2.5-cent property tax rate increase to cover the cost of early childhood, after-school and summer care for more than 9,000 children.\n\nProp A will cost the average county homeowner about $125 more per year in taxes and generate $75 million to fund the effort. It is expected to launch in late 2025 or early 2026, officials have said.\n\n-- Bianca Moreno-Paz\n\n12:15 a.m. update: Lockhart ISD voters approve ACC annexation\n\nVoters in the Lockhart school district approved joining the Austin Community College's taxing district Tuesday night, providing residents with in-district tuition and a path to a permanent ACC facility in the city, according to the final but unofficial election results.\n\nWith 24 of 24 precincts reporting, 61.21% of voters supported the annexation and an ad valorem tax, while 38.79% came out against the proposal.\n\nIn exchange for a property tax rate of $0.1012 per $100 of property valuation, the Lockhart school district will officially be part of the Riverbat community, with access to all educational resources and in-district tuition, including benefiting from ACC’s free tuition pilot program which launched this year.\n\nThe Austin, Del Valle, Elgin, Hays, Leander, Manor and Round Rock school districts are in-district.\n\nThe Greater Lockhart for ACC PAC said being annexed into the college district would provide the necessary accessible and affordable educational infrastructure to support the growing workforce opportunities in the region.\n\nThe last ACC annexation vote — of Pflugerville — failed in 2018. The last annexation proposal that passed before the Pflugerville vote was in 2010.\n\nThe results will not be official until they're certified by ACC board members at a Nov. 14 special meeting.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n11:50 p.m. update: Some Travis County Democrats leave disillusioned with Election Day results\n\nAs the clock approached 11 p.m. and the crowds thinned at the Travis County Democratic watch party at the Driskill Hotel in downtown Austin, friends Heather Westmoreland, 47, and Monica Holland, 42, remained in a row of mostly empty chairs watching the MSNBC feed on a small television. The two had arrived together about 7:30 p.m. excited to join the cheering crowds. Their hopes for the night took their first blow when they saw how quickly incumbent Ted Cruz was declared the victor in his Texas U.S. Senate race against Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred.\n\nThen, news networks declared Republican former President Donald Trump had won North Carolina. Their despair grew. The two watched the number of red seats in the U.S. House and Senate widgets on the corner of the TV screen grow and grow.\n\n“I’m honestly getting sick to my stomach. I’m getting flashbacks of the last time,” Westmoreland said as the two prepared to leave the watch party for the night. They were not optimistic.\n\nA transplant from Illinois six years ago and a Cedar Park resident, Westmoreland said she came into Election Day heavily focused on the loss of women’s reproductive protections. But as she sat through the night, she also found herself thinking: “Regardless of who wins, the biggest concern is what’s going to be of our country — with the civil unrest.”\n\nBoth women said they see “MAGA supporters” as verbally and physically threatening in their politically diverse neighborhoods of suburban Austin. Their unease with those they view as politically opposite has altered their life decisions for many years. Westmoreland has thrown out previous dreams of moving out to the Texas countryside with her partner and kids, opposed to the idea of moving farther into what she sees as the heartland of those she deeply disagrees with. Holland has lost close friendships with Round Rock neighbors since 2016. The rare conversations that occur, she said, quickly turn into political rambling.\n\n“I believe Trump for what he’s saying. That he’s being very literal,” Holland said. “But so many of his supporters say that’s not true, that he’s just saying that. And that’s what’s scary for me”\n\nWestmoreland nodded in agreement.\n\n“That last thing I want to hear from someone who voted for Trump is them saying, ‘Gosh, I didn’t see that coming.’” She grimaced. Holland did too, nodding. A Democratic Party employee stood in front of the television to announce the end of night’s watch party.\n\n-- Emiliano Gomez\n\n11:40 p.m. update: Texas Court of Criminal Appeals expected to have three new GOP judges\n\nTexas' highest court for criminal matters will have three new Republican judges come January, cementing Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's effort to remake the court in his image.\n\nPresiding Judge Sharon Keller, who became the first woman elected to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000, will be replaced by Dallas state Appeals Court Judge David Schenck. Schenck previously served under Gov. Greg Abbott when Abbott was Texas' attorney general.\n\nGina Parker, a former city, county and district attorney with no judicial experience, ousted Judge Barbara Hervey in the GOP primary and will take her seat on the bench in January.\n\nLee Finley, an attorney in private practice who also has not previously served as a judge, will replace Republican Judge Michelle Slaughter. Finley is from Collin County, Paxton's home turf.\n\nAs the American-Statesman reported in February, Paxton, a Republican, targeted the GOP incumbents over a 2021 Appeals Court opinion that maintained that the attorney general's office does not have the authority to prosecute voter fraud cases.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n11:40 p.m. update: GOP takes US Senate majority, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn wants to take charge\n\nWith the Republicans taking control of the U.S. Senate, the spotlight now turns on the Texan who was not on Tuesday's ballot: John Cornyn, the state's senior senator.\n\nCornyn has been spending much of the election year courting the votes of returning and incoming GOP senators in hopes of becoming the upper chamber's majority leader. Current leader Sen. Mitch McConnell is retiring from the top post but not from the Senate.\n\nCornyn told reporters last week in Austin that he expects the vote to take place in the next few days or weeks, and that his experience in the GOP leadership under McConnell positions him well to take charge.\n\n\"I'm confident our new conservative majority can restore our institution to the essential role it serves in our constitutional republic,\" Cornyn said in a statement late Tuesday.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n11:20 p.m. update: GOP incumbents on path to keep Texas Supreme Court seats\n\nRepublicans on the Texas Supreme Court will hold on to all three seats up for grabs this cycle, with incumbents defeating their Democratic challengers who targeted them over their votes on two major abortion cases.\n\nJustices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine each led their opponents by at least 15 percentage points as of 11:20 p.m., with roughly 75% of all votes reported. The victories extend Republicans' unbroken, 28-year winning streak on the state's court of last resort for civil cases.\n\n10:40 p.m. update: Republican Rep. Caroline Harris Davila on path to reelection to Texas House\n\nState Rep. Caroline Harris Davila, R-Round Rock, is poised to comfortably win a second term, as she lead her Democratic opponent Jennie Birkholz by 12 percentage points as of 10:40 p.m. Tuesday. Gov. Greg Abbott endorsed her in the race.\n\nIn 2022, she won the seat for House District 52, encompassing Hutto and a small portion of Round Rock, by 10 percentage points.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n10:35 p.m. update: Austin Mayor Kirk Watson poised to win reelection, avoid runoff\n\nIncumbent Kirk Watson, the perennial local politician who first served as Austin's mayor more than two decades ago, secured 51.4% support in his bid for reelection during early voting in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties. With 36 of 176 precincts reporting in Travis, his lead weakened slightly to 51.1% but remained safely above the 50% majority threshold needed for victory.\n\nEven before some Election Day results posted, Watson was optimistic.\n\n\"It looks to me very much like we're going to prevail in this race, but you can't call an election with just early vote(s),” he told supporters Tuesday night.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n10 p.m. update: Incumbents in competitive U.S. House races in Texas take early lead against opponents\n\nEarly voting totals show the three competitive U.S. House races in Texas, both in the Rio Grande Valley, are still tight, but the chances for flips are getting smaller.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen is leading his challenger, former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores of Los Indios, by four percentage points in the race for District 34. Just over 75% of the vote in that district has been reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, who is seeking a second term, has an eight-point edge against challenger Michelle Vallejo, 54% to 46%, with about 65% of the vote counted.\n\nIn District 28, longtime U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, is up 52% to 48% against GOP opponent Jay Furman with roughly 58% of the vote reported. Cuellar is facing a federal indictment over charges that he took foreign bribes.\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nAustin ISD declares victory on Proposition A; Election Day ballots still being tallied\n\nWith early votes counted, Austin school district administrators and board members declared victory Tuesday night on the district's proposed property tax rate increase to raise an additional $41 million in revenue.\n\nEarly returns showed almost 59% of people who voted early supported Proposition A, which would raise the school district's property tax rate by 9.1 cents. Travis County is still counting Election Day totals.\n\nA group of district administrators and board members, who gathered for a watch party at Punch Bowl Social on Congress Avenue, erupted in cheers and started chanting, \"Prop A! Prop A!\"\n\nSuperintendent Matias Segura thanked the community, his eyes tearing up. The district, which faces a $119 million budget deficit, will need to cut at least $90 million from its budget over the three years. This increased revenue means the district can stave off the most painful cuts, he said.\n\n\"There are things that we were going to have to consider that we're no longer going to have to consider,\" Segura said.\n\nBoard President Arati Singh vowed to spend the additional tax revenue in a way that will benefit students and teachers.\n\n\"We are going to spend this money in a way that is strategic, in a way that is going to increase student outcomes, that's going to give our kids the education they deserve,\" Singh said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:45 p.m. update: Austin City Council District 7 race appears headed to runoff\n\nA six-way race to represent District 7 on the Austin City Council is likely headed to a runoff.\n\nMike Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former Democratic nominee for congress, secured the most votes by far in early voting — 42%. But he must secure more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff but that could prove difficult with five challengers. Texas NAACP President Gary Bledsoe, the second-highest vote getter so far, received nearly 19% of the early vote.\n\nAs of 9:42 p.m., the Travis County Clerk had not posted Election Day results.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Three of four Round Rock ISD bond proposals take early favor\n\nThree of four Round Rock measures in a $1 billion bond package appear on track to pass, according to early but incomplete voting totals.\n\nProposition A is passing with 63.8% of the early votes. This $798.3 million proposal contains facility upgrades, replacements to equipment that is at the end of its life, safety upgrades and additional classrooms.\n\nProposition B is passing with 60.5% of the early votes. The $125.3 million proposal would upgrade technology. Proposition C, an $8.6 million proposal to upgrade fine arts, is passing with 56.2% of the early votes.\n\nThe $65.9 million Proposition D, which would construct a multipurpose athletic field and improve athletic facilities, is failing with 60.2% of voters coming out against the measure during early voting.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:20 p.m. update: Round Rock school board races show early leaders\n\nIn the Round Rock school district, incumbent Estevan \"Chuy\" Zárate is leading with 59.4% of the early votes against challenger Joshua Escalante in the Place 1 race, incomplete and unofficial results show.\n\nMelissa Ross is leading with 64.7% of the votes against April Guerra for the Place 2 seat.\n\nIn Place 7, Mingyuan \"Michael\" Wei is leading with 67.6% of the early votes against Jim Steele.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n9:15 p.m. update: Travis County voters poised to pass Proposition A\n\nTravis County Proposition A, the measure that would raise property taxes to help low-income families pay for childcare, appears poised to pass after receiving overwhelming support during early voting, unofficial and incomplete results show.\n\nAbout 60% of the voters who weighed in ahead of Election Day supported the measure. Travis County Judge Andy Brown and Precinct 1 County Commissioner Jeff Travillion, who attended an election night watch party hosted by the local Democratic Party, told the American-Statesman they were optimistic. \"We hoped that it would pass resoundingly,” Travillion said as the crowd around him cheered and booed the presidential results being aired on TV.

Mihaela Plesa, D-Dallas, is leading her GOP challenger Steve Kinard 52% to 48% in Collin County, according to early voting results, five other competitive races are trending slightly in favor of Republicans.\n\nIn San Antonio, state Rep. John Lujan earned 52% of the vote in early unofficial results, while his Democratic opponent Kristian Carranza snagged 48%. Republican Marc LaHood is up by the same margin against Laurel Jordan Swift, according to the unofficial Bexar County early voting results.\n\nEarly voting results in three other House seats presently held by Republicans:\n\nDenise Villalobos vs. Solomon Ortiz: 57% to 43% in Nueces County, early voting results show.\n\nState Rep.

Michael McCaul of Austin outdistanced his Democratic challenger Theresa Boisseau in the race for the 10th Congressional District.\n\nAn inside player in the GOP caucus, McCaul will return to Congress for an 11th term in January. He was besting the Democrat by 19 percentage points, racking up nearly 65% of the vote, according to the incomplete and unofficial returns. Libertarian Jeff Miller was drawing about 2%.\n\n-- John C.

The Democrat captured 69% of the early vote, according to unofficial and incomplete results. His challenger, Republican Daniel Betts, received 31%. About half of the county's 925,858 registered voters cast ballots early.\n\nIn an interview with the American-Statesman shortly after 8 p.m., Garza thanked county residents for their “vote of confidence.\"\n\n“It means that our work continues,” he said.\n\nThat work will include expanding the county’s sexual assault response team, as well as continuing to grow a unit that investigates wrongful convictions. Garza said when he was first elected in 2020, the conviction integrity unit had only one staff member.\n\n\"Over the last four years we’ve built a team,” he said. \"We’re just getting our sea legs.\"\n\n-- Skye Seipp and Emiliano Gomez\n\n8:30 p.m. update: Incumbent Kirk Watson takes early lead in five-candidate race for Austin mayor\n\nIncumbent Austin Mayor Kirk Watson has taken an early lead in his bid for reelection with 51.4% of the early vote in Travis, Williamson and Hays counties, according to unofficial vote totals.\n\nNo precincts have yet reported Election Day tallies in the three counties, however 52% of registered voters in Travis County cast their ballots early. Watson, who first served as Austin's mayor from 1997-2001, was again elected to the city's highest office in 2022. His mayoral term is shorter term than usual, slated at two years, after Austin voters in 2021 opted to move the mayoral election to be in line with the U.S. presidential race.\n\nWatson is facing four challengers. For a candidate to win the election outright, they'll need to secure more than 50% of the vote or the race will go into a runoff between the top two vote-getters.\n\nCommunity organizer and executive director of Go Austin/Vamos Austin Carmen Llanes Pulido is in second place with 18.8% support, according to early voting totals in the three counties. Coming in third place is former Austin City Council Member Kathie Tovo with 17% of the vote.\n\nTrailing further behind in early voting numbers are small business owner Jeffery L. Bowen who clinched around 7.9% of the early vote and the former director of Central Texas Interfaith Doug Greco received 4.5%.\n\n-- Ella McCarthy\n\n8:10 p.m. update: Donald Trump wins Texas, CNN and NBC News report\n\nFormer President Donald Trump won the general election in Texas for the third time, as well as in Florida and Tennessee, according to NBC News and CNN.\n\n7:50 p.m. update: Kamala Harris, Colin Allred take early leads in Travis County\n\nPresidential nominee Kamala Harris and U.S. Senate nominee Colin Allred, both Democrats, take early leads in Travis County and in the county's immediate neighbors to the north and south, the incomplete and unofficial returns show. Election Day ballots are still being counted.\n\nStatewide, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz were clinging to narrow leads. The early returns showed Allred running slightly ahead of Harris.\n\nAs expected, the GOP strength is anchored in rural Texas while the Democrats were riding high in the urban and some suburban centers. A notable exception is Tarrant County, the state's most purple urban/suburban enclave where Trump and Cruz have small leads.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n7:45 p.m. update: Democrats Doggett, Casar sail to reelection\n\nU.S. Rep.s Lloyd Doggett and Greg Casar, both of Austin, cruised to reelection Tuesday.\n\nDoggett, who has been in Congress since 1995, easily defeated Republican Jenny Garcia Sharon and Libertarian Girish Altekar in District 37. Casar won his second term over Republican Steven Wright in District 35.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n7:40 p.m. update: Manor ISD tax rate election gets early boost\n\nThe Manor school district's property tax rate election is narrowly pulling ahead with 52.9% of the vote, according to the early but incomplete results.\n\nIf voters approve Proposition A, they’d accept a school district property tax rate of $1.0814 per $100 of property valuation for the 2024-25 school year, 3 cents higher than $1.0514 per $100 valuation, which is the rate without the increase. If Proposition A is approved, the district expects to collect an additional $4.8 million in additional revenue.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n7:35 p.m. update: Austin ISD Proposition A takes early lead\n\nAlmost 59% of early voters approved the Austin school district's Proposition A, which officials said will provide employee raises and cut back the district's $119 million deficit, according to early voting results released by Travis County. About 52% of eligible Travis County voters cast early ballots. Election Day ballots are still being counted.\n\nIn the District 2 school board race to replace Ofelia Zapata, LaRessa Quintana has pulled ahead of Sarah Ivory with 60.2% of the early votes.\n\nFor the District 8, at-large, seat Fernando Lucas de Urioste is leading the crowded six-candidate race with 33.8% of the early votes. Lindsey Stringer and Amy Moore follow with 25.6% and almost 24% of the early votes, respectively. Nathaniel Hellman, Dylan \"Sky\" MacAdams and Nick Franke are also running for the seat.\n\nTrustees Lynn Boswell and Kevin Foster are running unopposed for reelection.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n7:20 p.m. Early election results show tight US Senate race in Texas\n\nWith a smattering of counties, some big and some small, reporting early election results, the race between Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred is about even. Keep in mind, the polls have been closed less than 20 minutes as of this update and Election Day votes are still being tallied.\n\nAllred is running comfortably ahead in his home base of Dallas County, as per the incomplete and unofficial returns. In neighboring Tarrant County, narrowly won by President Joe Biden four years ago, Cruz has a slim early lead.\n\nIn Williamson County, north of Austin, it's Allred with the slim lead, and he is also carrying Travis and Hays counties, early results show. So far, all of the rural counties reporting numbers show Cruz well ahead.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n5:20 p.m. update: Ken Paxton declines to join other attorneys general in calling for election peace\n\nThe National Association of Attorneys General is calling for and orderly election, and post-election, as the country prepares to elect it's 47th president. One state attorney general's name was conspicuously absent from the list of those who signed the open letter.\n\nTexas' own Ken Paxton.\n\nRecall that in the presidential election four years ago, and the weeks that followed, Paxton went to court seeking to nullify the results of the election in four of the battleground states that went for Democrat Joe Biden over incumbent Donald Trump.\n\nHere's what the attorneys general from the other 49 states and two U.S. territories had to say on the subject:\n\n“Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday’s election, we expect that Americans will respond peacefully and we condemn any acts of violence related to the results. A peaceful transfer of power is the highest testament to the rule of law, a tradition that stands at the heart of our nation’s stability. As Attorneys General, we affirm our commitment to protect our communities and uphold the democratic principles we serve.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:45 p.m. update: 'I don’t have a voice': Austin voter turned away after missing key deadline\n\nJeff Dukett thought he had done everything he needed to vote — but he left the Austin Oaks Church polling site without casting a ballot Tuesday afternoon because election workers told him he hadn’t updated his address in time.\n\nTo vote in the Nov. 5 election, a voter who moved would have had to update their address with the elections office by Oct. 7. Dukett, who moved from San Marcos to Southwest Austin, updated his address in late October, not realizing the deadline.\n\n“This is why people don’t get out to vote,” Dukett said, fuming. “It’s just frustrating because I know (the presidential race is) going to be close and I don’t have a voice.”\n\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State’s website, voters have few options if they miss the deadline to update their address 30 days before Election Day. If the voter still lives in the same city or county, they can return to their old precinct to vote — an option that doesn’t help Dukett, having moved one county to the north.\n\nTexas has a path for people who moved from one county to another to vote a “limited ballot,” which would include only those races that appear on the ballots for both the voter’s old address and their new one. That would include races such as president and U.S. Senate, but not mayor, for instance.\n\nBut that option didn’t help Dukett, either: Limited ballots are available only during early voting, not on Election Day.\n\n“I waited all day to do this,” Dukett said, frustrated as he left without voting. “I’ll never vote again.”\n\n-- Bridget Grumet\n\n4:30 p.m. update: Abbott appears bullish on school vouchers, even before polls close\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott aggressively campaigned during the March primaries against several GOP Texas House members who stood in the way of the Legislature last year enacting a school voucher program. And after he helped many of them get defeated, the governor expressed confidence he'd get his way when lawmakers return to Austin for a new legislative session in January.\n\nThat prediction is predicated on the outcome of a handful of state House races that will be decided when the votes are tallied Tuesday night. But Abbott's confidence showed no sign of waning even with a few hours left before the polls closed in Texas. His office put out an afternoon advisory that the govenor will hold \"a media availability on the importance of passing school choice for all Texas families\" in Tyler early Wednesday.\n\nDepending on how the voting goes, look for the governor's confidence level to flow over the brim, or for him to defiantly challenge the House to get with his program.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n4:15 p.m. update: Parents turning out for AISD Proposition A\n\nSome parents who came to Davis Elementary School in Northwest Austin to vote Tuesday decided to support the Austin school district’s proposed 9.1-cent tax rate increase. The district pledged to use the $41 million it will collect in additional revenue to give employees raises and pay down its $119 million deficit.\n\nJoyce Tseng, who has two children and is pregnant with a third child, said she wants her children’s teachers to have higher pay and access to better resources and thus supported Proposition A wholeheartedly.\n\nAmanda Armond didn’t have to think about whether to vote for the tax rate election. Her daughter goes to fifth grade at Davis and she wants to ensure teachers and students have the resources they need, she said.\n\n“If I have to pay more in taxes for the benefit of schools, teachers, what have you, I will, always,” Armond said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n4 p.m. update: Voters in Austin suburbs contribute to changing demographics\n\nJust north of Austin, Williamson County is one of several diverse and rapidly-growing suburban Texas counties that has moved from being safely Republican to purple territory in recent years.\n\nElected officials from the county are a mix of Republicans and Democrats, unlike those in deep-blue Travis County. And voters there slightly preferred President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020, but they also chose to reelect Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and a number of other GOP candidates that year.\n\nTwo residents who are part of that blue shift are Bryon Curtis and Keizhia Carlyle. Both see women’s and abortion rights as critical issues this year.\n\nLaw enforcement administrator and Hutto dad Bryon Curtis was emphatic about his opposition to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom he feels is “racist” and “a horrible person.”\n\nThe main reason Curtis voted for Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is her stance on abortion rights. “I have daughters,” he said. “I want them to have access to health care.” He also opposes mass deportation.\n\nWhile knocking on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee in Hutto, Curtis says he met numerous women who said they’re voting for Harris.\n\n“I've had a lot of women go, ‘I used to vote Republican, or my husband votes Republican, but I'm voting for Harris,’” he said. “It's the abortion issue … I think you'll have more women voting Democrat than you did traditionally.”\n\nKeizhia Carlyle said women's rights are at the top of her priorities. She also cited border issues as a top driver for her, saying she feels Republicans' statements about migration through the U.S. southern border exaggerate the problem.\n\n\"I just I think they're using (the border) as a hot-topic issue to get voted in, to scare people. ... And I don't think you should go to the polls in fear. You should know the truth and vote your beliefs.\"\n\nIn Hutto, she added, \"Jobs aren't being taken. People aren't, like, breaking into my home. ... This fear-mongering on TV and all that, I just feel like it's a lie.\"\n\nCarlyle, a Black woman, said the candidates' rhetoric on race and ethnicity was a major reason she chose to vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"The negative talk about women, people of color, minorities — I'm just tired of hearing the same old thing from Republicans,\" she said. \"It's like minorities don't matter. And I'm just trying to show through my voting that we do matter, and we do have a voice.\"\n\nOf the election in general, she said, \"I'm glad it's going to be over.\"\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\n3 p.m. update: Why all politics are local for this Texas voter\n\nLeaving the polling place after casting her vote at Deer Creek Elementary School in suburban northwest Travis County, Nikki Cherniak saw nothing to be gained by adding her voice to the almost deafening cacophony that has become the soundtrack to modern national politics.\n\nA retired teacher of 23 years, Cherniack said it was the school board races that motivated her Election Day decision to vote.\n\n\"I'm more interested in what's happening in my community than anything else,\" she said, adding that there's no shortage of opinions in the race for president and the contest for U.S. Senate.\n\n\"We need people on the school board who really understand the needs of the children and the teachers.\"\n\nCherniack declined to say which candidates running for places on the Leander school board best fit that bill because she didn't want to add to that white noise there, either.\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:45 p.m. update: US Senate candidates in Texas sprint to finish\n\nCampaigning in the tantalizingly close U.S. Senate race in Texas continued as Election Day voting was underway Tuesday.\n\nAt least in the virtual sense. Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz’s team, just before lunchtime, posted side-by-side images of his Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Colin Allred and former U.S. House Speaker (and still California congresswoman) Nancy Pelosi suggesting that his opponent would be in lockstep with the nation’s most prominent San Francisco liberal.\n\n\"Colin Allred's 100% voting record with Nancy Pelosi shows that he's too extreme for Texas,\" said the message posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAround the same time, Allred, a three-term congressman from Dallas, reminded voters that country music legend Willie Nelson was in his corner. In addition to Nelson, Allred's post also featured Cruz's 2018 opponent former Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, plus some national figures, repeating the message \"All in for Allred.\"\n\n-- John C. Moritz\n\n12:35 p.m. update: Voters 'hopeful' at University of Texas\n\nOn a sunny Election Day afternoon, Dalton Pastorius, a University of Texas sophomore majoring in government, said he has “never felt hope like this before.”“I’ve never been as hopeful as I am today,” he said. Standing outside the Texas Union in a 2008 T-shirt of former President Barack Obama on coins under the banner “Real change,” Pastorius handed out flyers with voting information, beaming with genuine excitement. Pastorius feels personally connected to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. In 2019 during the primaries, he had a poster of her on his wall. “I’m just so ecstatic to vote for her,” he said, encouraging people to vote and research the candidates up for office.\n\n-- Lily Kepner\n\n12:20 p.m. update: Austin voters weigh in on AISD Proposition A\n\nThe Austin school district, facing a $119 million budget deficit, is proposing a higher tax rate to raise revenue to help cut the shortfall and give teachers a raise.\n\nProposition A proposes to raise the school property tax rate from 85.95 cents per $100 of property valuation to 95.05 cents, which would raise $41 million for local schools and send another $130 million to the state as part of a decades-old program called recapture, which takes tax revenue from districts that collect more than their state-determined need for education funding and redistributing it to those that collect less in revenue than their state-determined need.\n\nOutside the Gus L. Garcia Recreation Center in Northeast Austin on a blustery Tuesday morning, Jose Brownlee, who has lived in Austin since 1996, stood in line with a group of other voters to cast his ballot.\n\nBrownlee said he voted against the district's tax rate proposal because his taxes are already too high.\n\n\"We're already struggling out here and everything's already tough,\" Brownlee said.\n\nHowever, Roy Spinoza sees Proposition A as an economic boon to the city.\n\nSpinoza, who has lived in Austin for 42 years, has three grandchildren in local schools. His desire to put Republican former President Donald Trump back in the White House drove him out to the polls Tuesday.\n\nThough he isn't excited about paying more in taxes, Spinoza thinks people need to invest in their city, which includes the schools, he said.\n\n\"I don't want to see Austin go down and get ruined just because no one wants to pay into it,\" Spinoza said.\n\nLikewise Lynette Cox, who moved to Austin six months ago, decided to vote in favor of the Austin school district tax rate election. Cox doesn't have children, but to her, investing in public education is a matter of principle.\n\n\"You have to invest in the future of the U.S.,\" Cox said.\n\nAustinite Trey Pasquariello also voted for the district's proposal, he said.\n\n\"Raising money for any schools is a good thing,\" Pasquariello said.\n\nHe also sees the investment as a return for his own home because if schools improve, then his home value will likely increase, he said.\n\n-- Keri Heath\n\n10:15 a.m. update: At the polls, Texas voters express opposing views on immigration, abortion\n\nThe line to vote on Tuesday morning snaked around the Wilco Hutto Annex building, a polling location in Hutto, a rural town about 30 miles north of Austin, with the wait to cast a ballot exceeding 45 minutes. It’s been this way since the polls opened at 7 a.m.\n\nWhile Hutto residents are mostly Republican, voters of all stripes were out on Election Day casting their ballots.\n\nAunchelle Weeks, 42, a Hutto business owner and mom, came to the polls with her daughter. She cast her vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Democratic congressman from Dallas who is running to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n“I just don’t feel like Trump has the country’s best interests at heart,” she said. “I think he’s in it for himself.”\n\nWeeks' three top issues: the economy, taxes and abortion rights. She feels Harris’ economic plan is more developed. GOP nominee Donald Trump’s plan, she feels, “has been tried and it hasn’t worked.”\n\nAsked what shapes her views on abortion, she said, “I got pregnant right after they turned over Roe v. Wade, and I had never been so frightened in my life for something to go wrong. And it really made me think about my girls going forward. I don’t want them to have that fear when their time comes to carry.\"\n\nTexas has one of the most restrictive abortions bans in the country, with no exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. Weeks said she’s hopeful that Harris will win.\n\n“I think that she’ll come through in the end and hopefully get things back on track,” Weeks said.\n\nFor professional firefighter Jason Oltman, 44, a dad to grown children, he turned out to support Republicans up and down the ticket though he said he voted for some Democrats in local races.\n\nOltman voted for Trump because he said the former president is \"not a politician.”\n\n“He can pretty much tell PACs to kiss his ass,\" he said. “He doesn’t have to depend on them, or he chooses not to listen,” he said, while acknowledging that Trump still takes donations from them.\n\nThe first reason Oltman gave for voting to reelect Cruz: he opposes sex change procedures for children. He also said voters “can’t just go off what they hear on TV,” referring to the political ads that have inundated the airwaves. “Everybody’s throwing knives.”\n\nAt the same polling place — Wilco Hutto Annex — Hutto resident Al Artus cast his votes for Trump, saying concerns about the former president's rhetoric are overblown.\n\n“I totally get his sense of humor,” he said of Trump. “They say, you know, ‘Orange man bad.’ They just don’t understand.”\n\nThe biggest concerns for him are immigration, inflation and the economy. Artus said he is deeply concerned about human trafficking, which occurs at the border, and feels Trump will crack down on those responsible.\n\n“We're standing on a gold mine of prosperity and wealth, but (they’re like), ‘No, let's just make everything more expensive and make it harder for people who are on fixed incomes,’” he said. “And why are we allowing women to be abused in such a way, children (to be abused) in such a way?”\n\nAs for abortion, it isn't a major concern for Artus.\n\n“I think if you have a problem with it, you just go to another state,” he said. “I don’t think we should have this one giant, powerful arm over everybody.”\n\n-- Bayliss Wagner\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIf you're voting on Election Day, polls in Texas are open from 7 a.m. through 7 p.m. local time.\n\nAs long as you're in the line by 7 p.m., you will be allowed to vote even if you haven’t been admitted inside a polling place. You have the right to stay in line as long as it takes to be able to cast your ballot.\n\nWhere can I vote on Election Day 2024?\n\nWhat do I need to bring to vote in Texas?\n\nVoters should come prepared to present one of seven acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas driver's license\n\nTexas personal identification card\n\nPassport\n\nTexas handgun license\n\nMilitary ID card\n\nCitizenship certificate\n\nTexas election identification certificate\n\nA student ID, even from a public school or college, is not an acceptable ID for voting under state law.\n\nAny otherwise qualified voter who cannot reasonably obtain one of the approved forms of photo ID can fill out a \"Reasonable Impediment Declaration\" at the voting location and present an alternative form of identification, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or voter registration certificate.\n\nWhat's on the ballot in the November 5 election?\n\nAlong with voting for the next president, eligible Texans can vote for other officials running on the local, state, and federal levels.\n\nHere is a look at what's on the ballot according to the Texas secretary of state website:\n\n1 U.S Senator (the seat currently held by Ted Cruz)\n\n1 of 3 Railroad Commissioners\n\n15 State Senators\n\n7 State Board of Education members\n\n3 members of the Texas Supreme Court\n\n3 members of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n5 Chief Justices and various justices for Texas Courts of Appeals\n\nLower-level judges and local county offices will also appear on the ballot:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/31/donnelly-one-few-democrats-back-notre-dame-professor-federal-court/817992001/", "title": "Donnelly voted to confirm possible Supreme Court justice", "text": "June 27, 2018, update\n\nAmy Coney Barrett is now among the potential replacements for retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nOriginal story\n\nWASHINGTON — Notre Dame Law School professor Amy Barrett — whose religion became a focal point of her nomination — is on her way to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals after the Senate voted Tuesday to confirm her nomination as judge on a largely party-line vote.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly, who had been targeted by both supporters and opponents of Barrett, was one of only three Democrats to back the nomination. Barrett was confirmed 55 to 43.\n\nBarrett had become a cause celebre among conservatives after some Democrats questioned whether she could separate her Catholic beliefs from her judicial opinions.\n\nHer ability to withstand the criticism is likely to elevate her chances of being considered for a future opening on the U.S. Supreme Court, especially if it were to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\n“There are few women better positioned for such an appointment than Professor Barrett,” said David Lat, founder of Above the Law, a website about the legal profession,\n\nIn the short-term, Barrett’s confirmation was a politically tricky vote for Donnelly, who faces a potentially narrow path to re-election next year as the only statewide-elected Democrat in a Republican state.\n\nDonnelly’s backing of Barrett risked angering liberals, who could be less likely to rally behind his re-election bid with contributions and volunteer manpower. But Donnelly probably would have faced more dissatisfied voters if he opposed Barrett, said Paul Helmke, a civics professor at Indiana University who ran for the Senate in 1998. Notre Dame is highly thought of in Indiana and Barrett is a well-regarded professor there, he said.\n\n“If he would vote against her, or try to hold up the nomination, I think (Hoosiers) would see that as somehow attacking one of the premier institutions in the state,” Helmke said. “Most people in the state are going to say, this is one that they can’t really criticize him for.”\n\nDonnelly, a Notre Dame graduate, said he voted for Barrett because — after reviewing her record, meeting her with and following her confirmation hearing — \"I believe she's qualified to serve as a circuit court judge.\"\n\n\"As I have repeatedly said, part of my job is to review, debate, and vote on judicial nominations,\" Donnelly said in a statement.\n\nDonnelly had the ability to block Barrett’s nomination through a Senate tradition that waits for home state senators to sign off on a nominee before the confirmation process begins.\n\nFormer Sen. Dan Coats, for example, did not sign off on President Obama’s nominee for the opening Barrett will now fill. Obama had selected Myra Selby to replace retired Judge John Tinder, an Indianapolis native appointed to the appeals court by George W. Bush.\n\nSelby would have been the first African American and the first woman from Indiana to serve on the court. Coats said at the time he opposed her nomination because she wasn’t chosen with the backing of a state commission, which was used for appointments in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDonnelly said that while he's \"very disappointed\" the Senate didn't take up Selby's nomination, \"I can only vote on the nominee that comes to the Senate floor.\"\n\nAfter Donald Trump became president, he won applause from conservative legal activists for his first slate of 10 federal judge nominations that included Barrett.\n\nTrump has the ability to reverse the liberal advantage in the circuit courts, in which nine of the 13 circuit courts have a majority of Democratic presidents’ nominees. Trump’s nominations could establish GOP control over nine appeals courts and leave three others deadlocked, based on current retirement trends.\n\nThe projected reversal is crucial, because while the Supreme Court hears only about 75 cases each term, the appeals courts hear some 30,000.\n\nConservative groups were closely watching Donnelly's actions.\n\nOn the other side, three liberal groups visited Donnelly’s state offices and made other public appeals for him to oppose Barrett.\n\n“Barrett has shown us all that she would not rule in favor of reproductive rights, an issue that has long plagued Hoosier women and is very important to Indiana NOW,” the board of the Indiana chapter of the National Organization for Women wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAt the committee’s confirmation hearing, Barrett said it was not appropriate for her to comment on whether she agrees with the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing abortion. What’s relevant, Barrett said, is whether she would “faithfully apply all Supreme Court precedent” if confirmed to the 7th Circuit – and that she promised to do.\n\nBut California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top Democrat, said she remained troubled about how Barrett would view issues through her religious beliefs.\n\n“When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you,” Feinstein said. “And that's of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for, for years in this country.”\n\nConservatives seized on that comment as indication that Democrats were applying an unfair religious litmus test. The Judicial Crisis Network launched a digital ad campaign criticizing Feinstein. And supporters of Barrett can buy a coffee mug with her photo on it along with the words \"The dogma lives loudly within you.\"\n\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, called the phrase “ugly anti-Catholic rhetoric.”\n\nGrassley had given Barrett a chance at the start of her hearing to address a law review article she co-wrote during law school on whether Catholic judges have the moral obligation to recuse themselves from enforcing the death penalty.\n\nBarrett said she stands by the article’s core proposition, “which is that if there is ever a conflict between a judge’s personal conviction and that judge’s duty under the rule of law, that it is never, ever permissible for that judge to follow their personal convictions in the decisions of the case rather than what the law requires.”\n\nBarrett’s supporters said that shows she will put the law first.\n\n\"Professor Barrett made clear that her personal views will have no bearing on her rulings as a judge,\" Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., said shortly before the Senate voted Tuesday.\n\nBut Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said the law review article’s suggestion that judges can recuse themselves from a case if they have a religious concern “is the very definition of putting faith ahead of one’s duties as a judge.”\n\n\"Barrett is an ideologue programmed to toe the conservative line at every step, and her confirmation is part of the Republican strategy to pack the courts with archconservatives who will be making decisions long after Donald Trump leaves office,\" Aron said in a statement after the vote.\n\nBut both the Alliance for Justice and conservative groups think the airing of the religious issue has inoculated Barrett from such future attacks if she is nominated for a future Supreme Court opening.\n\n\"The high profile nature of their attacks on her Catholicism only served to raise her star in the conservative legal community,\" said Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice. \"Barrett would almost surely get consideration if Justice Ginsburg retires.\"\n\nBarrett was already an attractive candidate as young, conservative and extremely well credentialed lawyer, Lat said.\n\n“And,\" Lat added, \"she weathered the controversy over her Catholic faith beautifully.\"\n\nContributing: Richard Wolf, USA TODAY.\n\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/06/brett-kavanaugh-moments-supreme-court-confirmation/1539791002/", "title": "Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: The plot twists and ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – It was no walk in the park. The battle over Brett Kavanaugh, which ended Saturday with his confirmation, was bitter and left in its path even deeper partisan divisions throughout the country.\n\nThe nation was kept in suspense for weeks during hours of hearings, FBI investigations, undecided senators and a smattering of sexual assault allegations. It was a remarkable and ugly set of twists and turns that led to Saturday's final vote.\n\nIn the end, Kavanaugh's appointment to the high court could tilt power to conservatives for years to come. Here are the 12 key moments that got us here:\n\n1. President Trump names Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces his nomination of Kavanaugh on July 9 to the high court to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAt a White House ceremony revealing his choice, Trump describes Kavanaugh as a man of \"impeccable credentials\" and a \"true thought-leader among his peers.\"\n\nLike Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, he has served on the second-most powerful court in the nation. Like Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch, he brings more than a decade's experience as a federal appeals court judge. And like Justice Elena Kagan, he has worked at the side of a two-term president.\n\nBut Kavanaugh's 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, combined with his Yale pedigree, Supreme Court clerkship under retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy and top posts under President George W. Bush, give him a resume the court's current justices can't match.\n\n2. Kavanaugh testifies despite heavy protests\n\nKavanaugh got his first chance to introduce himself to the American people on Sept. 4 amid angry protests from Democrats over withheld documents and public protests that resulted in dozens of arrests.\n\nThe protest was so rowdy it was labeled a \"mob rule\" by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. He said the constant interruptions by protesters screaming was \"unlike anything I’ve seen before in a confirmation hearing.\"\n\nDozens of people, the majority of them women, stood and shouted their opposition to Kavanaugh throughout the hearing. They were each carted away by authorities. Most of them said they feared he would change the status quo on abortion, health care, gun rights and other issues likely to come before the court in decades to come\n\nKavanaugh testified for three days before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On the fourth day, legal experts and other witnesses testify about his nomination. The allegations from Christine Blasey Ford were never raised.\n\n3. The missing documents\n\nKavanaugh had an unusually partisan background for a judge. He spent years investigating President Bill Clinton as part of independent counsel Ken Starr's team and also worked in the White House for President George W. Bush. Despite the release of hundreds of thousands of pages of records through these years, some of it remained under wraps.\n\nDuring hearings on the Senate Judiciary Committee in early September, senators complained about not getting the documents and about 190,000 pages released to the Senate but withheld from public release.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., had what he described as a \"Spartacus\" moment during the hearing when he said he would violate Senate rules to release some confidential documents. Republicans said the documents in question had been cleared for release earlier that day.\n\n4. Opinions on indicting a president, abortion\n\nWhen independent counsel Kenneth Starr was heading the investigation into President Bill Clinton, he hired Kavanaugh as an assistant. In that post, Kavanaugh argued that Clinton's lies about his affair with Monica Lewinsky could be grounds for impeachment. But a decade later, he wrote that presidents should not be subject to \"time-consuming and distracting\" civil lawsuits or criminal investigations while in office.\n\nThose writings were a pivotal issue for Democrats as special counsel Robert Mueller continues his investigation into Russian meddling into he 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats tried to get Kavanaugh's to say how he might rule if matters relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation implicate the president. He would not say if he believes a sitting president has the right to refuse to answer a subpoena or to pardon himself, as Trump has said he has the right to do. Kavanaugh called it a \"hypothetical\" question.\n\nWhen asked if he would owe loyalty to President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh said his loyalty would be to the Constitution. \"No one is above the law in our constitutional system,\" he said.\n\nKavanaugh is also a devout Catholic and some abortion rights advocates fear he could become the deciding vote that overturns Roe vs. Wade – the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\"It has been reported that you have said that Roe is now settled law,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said to the judge. \"What do you mean by settled law? Do you believe it is correct law?\"\n\nKavanaugh said the case \"is an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times.\"\n\nHe said the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood vs. Casey had created \"precedent upon precedent\" by clearly reaffirming Roe in ruling that \"matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime ... are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n5. Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault\n\nFord, a psychology professor in California, quietly sends a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, on July 30. In the letter, she alleges that Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted her while they were in high school. Feinstein does not release the letter publicly, at Ford's request.\n\nBut after Kavanaugh's hearings are over, the allegations made their way into the press. At first they were anonymous allegations of sexual assault, but then Ford told her story to The Washington Post. In the piece, published Sept. 16, Ford details a house party when the pair were teens in the 1980s.\n\nShe alleged Kavanaugh groped her and placed his hands over her mouth to keep her from screaming.\n\n6. Second woman make sexual assault accusations\n\nThe New Yorker releases a report on Sept. 23 that a second woman had come forward with sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, a woman who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself at a dorm party and \"thrusting his penis\" in her face, according to the story. The alleged incident occurred during the 1983-84 academic year, the story says.\n\nSeparately, attorney Michael Avenatti, who represents adult film star Stormy Daniels in her hush-money case against Trump, tweets that he represents a third woman with \"information\" on Kavanaugh.\n\n7. Third sexual assault claim raises doubts\n\nJulie Swetnick, a client of Avenatti, alleged in a signed statement released Wednesday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh would drink to excess and \"engage in abusive behavior\" toward teenage girls while he was in high school.\n\nIn a statement released by Avenatti, Swetnick said that in the 1980s, she witnessed efforts by Kavanaugh and his classmate Mark Judge to get teenage girls \"inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang-raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys.\"\n\nThe accusation was handled differently than the others and was not part of an FBI investigation. Sen. Susan Collins mentioned these allegations as a rationale of why Kavanaugh should be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n8. Ford and Kavanaugh take turns testifying\n\nKavanaugh and Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27. Ford, the first woman to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, alleges that the nominee attempted to assault her at the house party in the 1980s.\n\nThe hearings were fraught with emotion, with both Ford and Kavanaugh holding back tears as they answered questions from the committee and outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. When asked how certain she was that Kavanaugh was the man who had pinned her to a bed and attempted to take off her clothes, Ford said “100 percent.”\n\nKavanaugh was, on the other hand, was angry and tearful during his testimony, going off script in his opening statement to accuse Democrats of “grotesque” character assassination. He “categorically and unequivocally” denied Ford’s allegation, as well as the others made against him.\n\n9. Committee OKs nomination but wants FBI investigation\n\nIt was a dramatic and tense Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that led to Republicans compromising and asking Trump for an FBI investigation. Sen. Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican, was the driving force behind the surprising Sept. 28 hearing outcome.\n\nFlake and several other Republicans on the fence voted in favor of Kavanaugh, helping him pass a committee vote, with the caveat that they wanted a week delay and an FBI investigation before a full Senate vote.\n\nTrump later approved the request and asked the FBI to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh to examine the sexual assault allegations that had surfaced.\n\nQuickly, though, the investigation became partisan as Democrats accused the White House of intruding and keeping agents from questioning witnesses. Both Ford, the first woman to accused Kavanaugh, and Kavanaugh were not questioned as part of the FBI's investigation.\n\n10. Kavanaugh's op-ed and Fox interview\n\nWriting in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal on Oct. 4, Kavanaugh said he regretted his tone at times during his testimony refuting Ford's claim.\n\n\"I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said.\"\n\nKavanaugh used the piece to rebuff criticism that his tone and comments targeting Democrats during the hearing could be seen as a political bias and something that could hang over decisions for years to come.\n\nThe nominee also appeared on Fox News in an interview where he sought to fight against the sexual assault allegations.\n\nSitting next to his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, the nominee flatly rebutted the accusations and said he would not withdraw.\n\nThe judge said he never had sexual intercourse \"or anything close to (it)\" until long after he left Georgetown Prep, the elite all-boys Catholic high school he attended in Rockville, Maryland.\n\n“So you’re saying through all these years that are in question that you were a virgin?” Kavanaugh was asked.\n\n“That’s correct,\" he replied.\n\n11. Swing votes in the air\n\nAfter the Senate moved to advance Kavanaugh's confirmation, the spotlight fell to four conflicted senators who held his fate.\n\nThe drama over a heated confirmation that has transfixed and tore apart much of the nation essentially ended when one of those four, Republican Susan Collins of Maine took to the Senate floor and announced her support of Kavanaugh. She ostensibly gave him the vote he needs for confirmation.\n\nFriday started as spellbinding drama as the quartet – Collins and fellow Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia – gradually began revealing how they would vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.\n\nAt one point, Murkowski told reporters it was \"the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I’ve ever had to make ... \"\n\nIn the end, she said she would not vote for him.\n\nManchin became the only Democratic senator to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. He joined Flake and Collins in their support.\n\n12. The final tally\n\nThe Senate voted Saturday to confirm Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, ending a bitter battle over his nomination and possibly solidifying conservative control of the highest court in the land for years to come.\n\nThe final vote was 50-48, almost completely down party lines with Sen. Joe Manchin being the only Democrat who voted in favor of Kavanaugh. Murkowski, voted present to allow Sen. Steve Daines to skip the vote and attend his daughter's wedding without changing the final margin of the vote to confirm Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I applaud and congratulate the U.S. Senate for confirming our GREAT NOMINEE, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, to the United States Supreme Court,\" Trump posted on Twitter after the vote. \"Later today, I will sign his Commission of Appointment, and he will be officially sworn in.

Johnson is one of the most consequential US presidents, responsible for passing some of the most significant pieces of legislation in modern history, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nBut his legacy is complicated because it’s intertwined with the escalations of the Vietnam War, which resulted in more than 58,000 US military casualties, according to the National Archives.\n\n“It’s been a half a century since LBJ was in the Oval Office, and he remains this misunderstood, enigmatic figure,” said Mark Updegrove, president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “Some people think he was a power-hungry warmonger. Other people think he was the greatest civil rights president since Abraham Lincoln.”\n\nDuring his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson installed a recording device that saved all his phone calls. According to the LBJ Library, Johnson's secretaries knew about it, but they were the only ones -- not even the first lady was aware she was being recorded. LBJ Library\n\nDuring his time in office, Johnson installed a tape-recording system which secretly recorded all his calls. These recordings offer a rare and intimate look at the president’s strategy and confessions.\n\nHere are five of the top moments secretly captured during Johnson’s presidency.\n\nJohnson calls Vietnam ‘the biggest damn mess’\n\nOne of the big challenges Johnson faced during his presidency was the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\nJohnson, who inherited the conflict in Southeast Asia from the Kennedy administration, admitted early on in his presidency he did not know what to do. He believed the US had several choices in dealing with Vietnam, including sending in troops to “start attacking the Viet Cong,” or withdrawing and leaving South Vietnam to its fate.\n\nOn a call with national security adviser McGeorge Bundy on May 27, 1964, Johnson voiced his concerns about the war.\n\n'The biggest damn mess I ever saw': President Johnson on Vietnam On a secretly recorded call in 1964, former President Johnson told National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy about his concerns escalating the war in Vietnam. Johnson ultimately decided to send more troops to Vietnam, a decision that historians agree cost Johnson the re-election in 1968. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson said, “It just worries the hell out of me. I don’t see what we can ever hope to get out of there with once we’re committed … I don’t think it is worth fighting for, and I don’t think we can get out. And it’s just the biggest damn mess I ever saw.”\n\n“Vietnam was really a very difficult thing for him. He never was comfortable with our presence in Vietnam,” said Jim Jones, special assistant to Johnson. “He felt that the United States had given its word with two different administrations, the Eisenhower administration and the Kennedy administration – it’s given its word to Vietnam.”\n\nJohnson ultimately decided to send more troops to Vietnam. He first he authorized sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Then he sent combat forces. And by November 1965, there were 175,000 troops in Vietnam, with an additional 100,000 the following year. The number surged to 535,000 by the end of Johnson’s presidency, according to the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.\n\nCritics say the decision cost tens of thousands of American lives, and historians agree Vietnam cost Johnson reelection in 1968.\n\nJohnson tells Martin Luther King Jr., ‘we just won’t give up an inch’\n\nJohnson had numerous calls with civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\nPresident Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr. at the White House in 1963. Okamoto/PhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\nShortly after becoming president following John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Johnson told King, “I’m going to try to be of all of your hopes.”\n\nKing responded, “I am so happy to hear that, and I knew that you had just that great spirit, and you know you have our support and backing.”\n\nJohnson tells Martin Luther King Jr. 'we just won't give up an inch' Lyndon Johnson called Martin Luther King Jr. shortly after John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 to tell him his plan to pass federal civil rights legislation as a tribute to Kennedy. The former president said told the civil rights leader, 'I'm going to try to be of all of your hopes.' Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson used the months after the assassination, which he described as “an impossible period,” to pass federal civil rights legislation as a tribute to Kennedy. “I’m going to ask the Congress Wednesday to just stay there until they pass them all. They won’t do it. But we’ll just keep them there next year until they do, and we just won’t give up an inch,” he said.\n\n“No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long,” Johnson said in a speech as he advocated for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nJohnson followed through on this goal, signing both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n“Lyndon Johnson was the advocate for the most significant civil rights legislative record since the nation’s founding,” said Melody Barnes, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President Barack Obama. “It allowed for Barack Obama to be President of the United States.”\n\nThe President’s wife critiques his performance, giving him a B+\n\nJohnson’s tapes also capture affectionate moments between him and his wife, Lady Bird.\n\nOn one occasion, as Johnson was about to announce he had ordered the first bombing of North Vietnam, the first lady called. She said she rang, “merely to tell you I loved you. That’s all.”\n\nFirst lady Lady Bird Johnson with her husband in the Oval Office in 1968.\n\nAnother time in 1964, the first lady called minutes after a press conference to critique his performance. Johnson had made several personnel announcements and then answered questions from reporters about a series of topics including relations with France and Vietnam.\n\nPresident Johnson's wife critiques his performance and gives him a B+ In 1964, the first lady called the President minutes after his press conference to critique his performance. She said he looked strong, firm and reliable, but he was a little breathless, looked down too much, spoke too fast and didn't change his pace enough. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nShe started by complimenting him saying he looked strong, firm and reliable.\n\nBut she continued to say, “During the statement, you were a little breathless, and there was too much looking down, and I think it was a little too fast. Not enough change of pace, dropping voice at the end of sentence. There was a considerable pickup in drama and interest when the questioning began. Your voice was noticeably better, and your facial expressions noticeably better.”\n\nShe gave him a B+ grade and recommended he give a shorter written statement.\n\nWhat did the President think of his own performance? He said, “I thought it was much better than last week.”\n\nThe call ended with the first lady saying, “I love you very much.” And Johnson saying, “OK, goodbye.”\n\nJohnson tells Judge Thurgood Marshall to ‘do this job Lincoln started’\n\nThe tapes also revealed the President’s carefully laid out plan to groom Thurgood Marshall to become the first Black man on the US Supreme Court.\n\nMarshall was unaware of all this when Johnson first called him in 1965, asking the federal appeals court judge to become solicitor general of the US.\n\nJohnson grooms Thurgood Marshall for the Supreme Court President Johnson called Thurgood Marshall in 1965 asking the federal appeals court judge to leave the secure position to become a solicitor general of the US -- where he could be fired at any time. This was part of Johnson's carefully laid out plan to set Marshall on the path to become the first Black Supreme Court justice. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\n“I want the top lawyer in the United States representing me before the Supreme Court to be a Negro. And be a damn good lawyer that’s done it before.” He added, “I want to do this job that (Abraham) Lincoln started, and I want to do it the right way.”\n\nLeaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post – where he could be fired at any time – at first concerned Marshall. But Johnson, a master persuader, convinced him during the call.\n\nJudge Thurgood Marshall with Johnson, following Marshall's appointment to the Supreme Court. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nTwo years later, Johnson’s plans came to fruition, and he appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court. Marshall served until 1991. He died in 1993.\n\nNixon sabotaged Johnson’s peace talks with Vietnam\n\nNear the end of his term, Johnson tried to organize peace talks between North and South Vietnam but was shocked when suddenly South Vietnam, ally to the US, withdrew.\n\nThe FBI learned it occurred because Republican nominee Richard Nixon had intervened and promised South Vietnam a better deal under his administration.\n\n“This is a shocking revelation. An American presidential candidate is taking steps to undermine the foreign policy during a war of the sitting President,” explained Guian McKee, an associate professor in Presidential Studies at the Miller Center.\n\nJohnson alerted Sen. Everett Dirksen about the campaign’s interference and asked him to tell Nixon to “quit playing with it.”\n\nJohnson on Nixon: 'This is treason' Johnson tried to organize peace talks between North and South Vietnam but It was derailed when Republican nominee Richard Nixon intervened and promised South Vietnam a better deal under his administration. In 1968, Johnson told Sen. Everett Dirksen about the interference and said, 'This is treason.' Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson told Dirksen, “This is treason.”\n\nNixon won the election in 1968, and the Vietnam War ended six years later when Saigon fell to the communists in April 1975.\n\n“In the final analysis, we actually had a better deal going at that time than we did when we pulled out of Vietnam in ’75. And in that time frame the lives lost was about 25,000,” said Jones, special assistant to Johnson. “If it hadn’t been for the Nixon (campaign), I think we could have gotten a peace agreement in Vietnam.”", "authors": ["Janelle Davis"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-live-updates-harris-trump-polls/75879249007/", "title": "Election updates: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump court swing states", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the 2024 election from Monday, Oct. 28.

Harris and President Joe Biden both used the rally to contrast the Democratic campaign with Trump's, as polls continued to show a photo-finish race.\n\nHarris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz rallied together in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for one of their final pitches to swing state voters. The rally focused on individual freedoms, particularly reproductive rights that they said have been under assault since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

They're your neighbor. They're your coworkers,” he said. “And that is the reason why this election should not be close. It should be clear.”\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHarris at Michigan rally: Trump refused to 'acknowledge the pain' caused by overturning Roe v.

Most analysts believe the race is pretty much tied.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump makes pitch to women\n\nThe gender gap appears to be very much on former President Donald Trump's mind.\n\nWhile not specifically mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris' substantial advantage among female voters, Trump devoted a segment of the Atlanta rally to a specific theme: \"I will protect the women of our country.\"\n\nTrump then proceeded to describe crime, illegal border crossings, and the economy as women's issues.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump: 'I'm not a Nazi'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is spending part of this Atlanta rally disputing some Democratic accusations against him — including claims he is another \"Hitler\" and a \"Nazi.\"\n\n\"'He's Hitler!'\" Trump mockingly growled at one point. \"And then they say 'he's a Nazi.'\"\n\nHe quickly added: \"I'm not a Nazi ... I'm the opposite of a Nazi.\"\n\nTrump also disputed allegations that he is too old and \"tired,\" saying he has never been more energized.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump opens Atlanta rally, criticizes Michelle Obama\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his Atlanta rally more than 50 minutes late, reminding Georgia voters how important they will be next week. \"We love Georgia,\" Trump told the cheering crowd.\n\nHe also started what was now his standard speech opening question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? No, the crowd replied.\n\nTrump added a notable name to his Democratic attack list: former first lady Michelle Obama, who ripped the former president in a weekend speech.\n\n\"She was nasty,\" Trump told the Atlanta crowd.\n\nThe former first lady told Harris supporters about Trump: \"I hope that you’ll forgive me if I’m a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn’t even have the courage to do.\"\n\nReplied Trump: \"That was a big mistake she made.\" He did not elaborate.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump: Harris running a 'campaign of demonization and hate'\n\nAt one point, former President Donald Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of \"running a campaign of demonization and hate,\" drawing accusations of hypocrisy. \"She's a hater,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats pointed out that Trump is the one who has attacked Harris' intelligence, ethnicity, and competence.\n\nEarlier, Harris said Trump is \"fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country,\" citing Sunday's Madison Square Garden rally as the latest example.\n\n\"It is absolutely something that is intended to and is fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country,\" Harris said.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJohn Legend calls Trump a 'career con artist'\n\nJohn Legend on Monday opened for a concert and rally supporting Vice President Kamal Harris at Temple University's Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, with the musician saying the Democratic presidential nominee would be a president for \"every American\" if elected.\n\n\"The contrast could not be clearer,\" Legend said, adding that former President Donald Trump was focused on serving Wall Street, billionaires, big corporations, and \"whichever dictator wrote him a nice note or gave him a hug.\"\n\nThe voters have a choice, Legend said — they could either pick Harris or \"you can stand with a career con artist who's far more interested in himself than in you.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and rockstar Bruce Springsteen are scheduled to attend the Philadelphia event.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nMichelle Obama to campaign for Harris on Saturday\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will stump for Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the Harris campaign announced Monday night. It did not specify where.\n\nDuring an appearance at a Michigan rally Saturday, Obama criticized former President Donald Trump, referring to the Republican presidential candidate as a \"convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse\" who has \"no honesty, no decency, no morals.\"\n\n“I hope you’ll forgive me if I am worried that we will blow this opportunity to finally turn the page on this ugliness once and for all,” Obama said in the rally supporting Harris. \"Because believe me, if Donald Trump is president again, at some point or another, that ugliness will touch all of our lives.\"\n\nThough former President Barack Obama has headlined multiple rallies for Harris this month, it was not a given that his wife would appear at additional events.\n\nThe former first lady is also headlining a rally that’s being put on by her nonpartisan, nonprofit organization When We All Vote on Tuesday in Atlanta. She is expected to emphasize the importance of voting.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocrat on Trump's 'little secret' remark: It's incumbent 'to be transparent'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said during his Madison Square Garden rally that he has a \"little secret\" to help the GOP win big in congressional races.\n\nThat cryptic reference has Democrats questioning what the Republican presidential nominee could mean with a little more than a week to go before Election Day. Some Democrats thought Trump's remarks referred to the House's role in settling — or perhaps trying to overturn — contested election results for the White House.\n\n\"It's incumbent upon them to be transparent and to tell the voters exactly what their secret is, and if it is not an effort to overturn the election with Mike Johnson as the Speaker of the House, then tell us what it is,\" said Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who before being elected to Congress served as a federal prosecutor and later a lead counsel during Trump's first impeachment.\n\nBut the Trump campaign said the former president was simply referring to a campaign strategy in which he tunes in to virtual rallies in key House districts that will determine which party controls the chamber for the next two years.\n\n\"President Trump has done countless tele-rallies reaching millions of Americans across the country in key regions that also helps bolster Republicans in congressional races,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.\n\n— Riley Beggin and Josh Meyer\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasts Trump rally as 'racist'\n\nTop House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that former President Donald Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden Sunday featured \"racist, dangerous and un-American statements\" from the president's supporters.\n\n\"The unadulterated hatred directed at Puerto Ricans, the Jewish community, women, Latinos, African-Americans, Muslim Americans and decent people of every race by Donald Trump and far right extremists is disqualifying,\" he said. \"These people are unfit to govern and must forever be banished to the dustbin of history in November.\"\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe who spoke before Trump on Sunday, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” joked about a Black person in the crowd “carving watermelons” and said Latinos don't use birth control. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson falsely referred to Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is half-Black and half Indian-American as “Samoan-Malaysian” and a “low IQ former California prosecutor.” Businessman Grant Cardone referred to Harris's nonexistent “pimp handlers.”\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nWhat are the swing states? See polling, past results for key states for 2024 presidential election\n\nJust more than a week away from Nov. 5, all eyes are on seven states that are likely to decide the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been cycling through these battleground states hosting rallies, giving interviews and bringing celebrities along for the ride, as they try to persuade any remaining undecided voters and mobilize their supporters.\n\nNational polls and state polls alike are showing an incredibly close race. That means small margins of voters in these states could have big consequences for the Electoral College. Here is what to know about the battleground states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump to Christians: Get out there and vote\n\nDuring a religious summit near Atlanta, Trump talked about the role of faith in his life − particularly in surviving the July 12 assassination attempt − and in the presidential election.\n\n“We have to get all the Christians to get out there and vote,\" Trump told the supportive group.\n\nTrump, who is counting on religious voters in Georgia and other battleground states, said Christians don't always turn out for elections.\n\n\"I shouldn't scold anyone,\" he said, \"but Christians aren't known for being very solid voters, you know.\"\n\nFaith summit organizers ended the event by praying with Trump.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nHarris campaign turns Trump comedian’s Puerto Rico insult into TV ad\n\nThe Harris campaign quickly seized on a highly ridiculed insult about Puerto Rico from a comedian during Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, turning the remark into a 30-second television ad.\n\nThe new ad features a clip of comedian Tony Hinchliffe referring to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” before Trump is heard saying, “Puerto Rico.”\n\n“I will never forget what Donald Trump did,” Harris says in the ad as she criticizes Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017 while he was president. “He abandoned the island and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults. Americans deserve better.”\n\nThe Harris campaign has highlighted the insult in its appeal to Puerto Rican voters, who represent a significant share of voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nMariah Carey joins Kerry Washington for GOTV video\n\nThe Queen of Christmas will need to wait just a little longer.\n\nMariah Carey posted a playful video on social media Monday of her singing the intro of the song “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” before Kerry Washington burst into view.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no. It’s not your season yet,” Washington says, decked out in a VOTE shirt and hat. “It’s voting season.” She proceeds to ask Carey if the pop star has registered and made a plan to vote.\n\n“It’s my season, before it’s her season,” Washington joked. The actress previously played a political uber-fixer on the hit-show Scandal and has been campaigning for Kamala Harris.\n\n“So now all we need is youuuuu,” the pair sang.\n\n–Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris to sit with host Charlamagne tha God for second interview\n\nHarris will sit down with radio host Charlamagne tha God on Tuesday morning for an interview a week out from Election Day, the Hill reported. The interview will air at 7 a.m. on his radio show “The Breakfast Club.”\n\nThis marks Harris’ second interview in weeks with the popular host. Earlier this month, he hosted an “audio town hall” with her in Detroit, where she faced wide-ranging questions about her candidacy and the 2024 race.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump attends 'National Faith Advisory Board Summit' near Atlanta\n\nBefore his rally tonight outside Atlanta, Trump made a stop at a religious forum hosted by former spiritual adviser Paula White.\n\n\"That is a lot of religion out there,\" Trump told the cheering crowd at the inaugural National Faith Advisory Board Summit.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nJD Vance responds to racist, vulgar comments from Trump’s MSG rally\n\nDuring a Wisconsin campaign event on Monday, Republican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance responded to racist and crude remarks about Puerto Rico, Blacks, Jews and women made at Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, saying that “we need to stop being so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.”\n\n“I’m so over it,” Vance said, of the outraged response.\n\nVance was asked by a reporter about how he and Trump would unite the country if they are elected, after Trump’s rally on Sunday night. where speakers called Kamala Harris the “antichrist” and “the devil” and a comedian made racist jokes.\n\nVance, who also spoke at the Madison Square Garden rally, said he had not yet listened to the controversial comments.\n\nEarlier in his speech on Monday, Vance argued that Harris was “endangering the life” of Trump. He criticized Harris for calling Trump a fascist and her running mate, Tim Walz, for comparing Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to a pro-Nazi event.\n\n–Karissa Waddick\n\nWho is Tony Hinchcliffe, aka 'Kill Tony, the Trump-supporting comedian?\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, known as Kill Tony, has been known for years for his offensive material, but he became front page news on Sunday night at a rally for Donald Trump thanks to comment targeting Latinos, Blacks and Jews one week from Election Day.\n\n\"I don't know if you know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\" Hinchcliffe said in New York City. \"I think it's called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nHe went on to say that Latinos \"love making babies\" and made a vulgar remark about immigrants entering the country.\n\nThe 40-year-old proceeded to point out a Black man out in the crowd, claiming the two had \"carved watermelons together.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has attempted to distance itself from the comedian. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt took to Fox News where she dismissed Hinchcliffe's comments.\n\n\"It was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste,\" she said Monday morning. \"Obviously that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign.\"\n\nHinchcliffe's comments have sparked outrage and criticism from both sides of the aisle and he has long been known for his insult-style comedy, as a recurring figure on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and garnering millions of subscribers on his own weekly podcast \"Kill Tony.\"\n\n−Sam Woodward\n\nWalz rips Trump over 'garbage can' of the world remark\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz tore into former President Donald Trump at a Monday event in Waukesha, Wisc. for saying the U.S. is the \"garbage can for the world\" in a speech last week.\n\n\"Very difficult to love this country when Donald Trump can only love himself. That's why he has a difficult time doing that,\" the Democratic vice presidential nominee told a small group of invited Kamala Harris supporters at the Co-Pilot Cafe.\n\n\"Their closing argument last night was clear to the rest of the world. It's about hate, it's about division, it's about, dividing us,\" Walz said, referring to the former president's Sunday night rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. The event featured several speakers who made racist comments about Harris, Puerto Ricans, Latinos in general, and Blacks.\n\nWalz said that, while the Harris campaign has a to-do list, \"Donald Trump has an enemies list. It just gets longer and longer every day.\"\n\nHe spoke after Waukesha Mayor Sean Reilly, a lifelong Republican who became an independent after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and recently endorsed Harris.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nNevada Supreme Court upholds counting mail ballots without postmarks after Election Day\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday the state could count mailed ballots that arrive without a postmark up to three days after Election Day.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump’s campaign committee had sought to block the counting on ballots without postmarks. But the high court noted that state law says if “the date of the postmark cannot be determined,” ballots received within three days of Election Day “shall be deemed to have been postmarked on or before the day of the election.”\n\nTossup states such as Nevada have become a legal battleground over rules in the closely contested election. Republicans have focused many of their cases on the rules for voter registration and counting mailed ballots.\n\nBut few votes are at stake in the postmark dispute because only 24 arrived that way during the primary, according to the trial judge.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump to address the press on Tuesday morning\n\nThe Trump campaign has been secretive about this week's non-rally schedule as Election Day nears on Nov. 5. But it did let one cat partially out of the bag Monday: The Republican presidential nominee will be speaking with the media on Tuesday.\n\nTrump \"will deliver remarks to the press in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday,\" said a short announcement. The event takes place at his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\nNo word on topic or whether he will take questions.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nBallot box attack an ‘attempt to disenfranchise,’ Washington state Dems chair says\n\nWashington state’s Democratic leader is speaking out after reports that hundreds of votes were destroyed after a ballot box was set on fire early Monday morning.\n\nAuthorities, including the FBI, are investigating after someone allegedly stuck an incendiary device to a ballot box at a public transit center in Vancouver, Washington, which ignited flames, according to local news reports. The result is hundreds of burned ballots, elections officials said.\n\nShasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement to USA TODAY that this represents “an attempt to disenfranchise” voters. State Democrats trut that law enforcement and other officials will \"find those responsible and hold them accountable,\" she added.\n\nThe attack in Washington is the second ballot box fire that police have responded to in the Pacific Northwest region. In nearby Portland, police responded to a fire at a ballot box on Monday morning at an elections office.\n\nConrad and others stressed how people concerned about their ballot was destroyed should check its status at VoteWA.gov or by calling their county's auditor or elections department to find out where their ballot is in the process of being counted. To get a replacement ballot, Washington state voters can call the Clark County elections office at 564-397-2345 or send an email to elections@clark.wa.gov.\n\n−Phillip M. Bailey\n\nKids pick Harris in Nickelodeon contest to win the presidency\n\nChildren across the country selected Kamala Harris to win the White House in Nickelodeon’s nationwide “Kids Pick the President” contest, the network announced Monday.The virtual survey of more than 32,000 of the nation’s children showed 52% supported Harris and 48% supported Donald Trump. The contest is intended for entertainment purposes only and is not a scientific poll. “Kids Pick the President” has accurately predicted the outcome of every election but two since 1988. Kids chose John Kerry over George W. Bush in 2004 and Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\nVoters in the 2024 election must be 18 years old on or before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nHarris to Black men: You’re not in Trump’s club\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned Black men thinking about backing former President Donald Trump in 2024 that her Republican rival doesn’t care about them like she does.\n\n“Part of what we have to help people understand is, don't think you're in Donald Trump's club,” Harris, the Democratic nominee, told football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in an interview on his podcast, “Club Shay Shay.”\n\n“You're not,\" she added. \"He's not going to be thinking about you.”\n\nHarris specifically brought up racial disparities in colon cancer and prostate cancer deaths, and the need to do medical screenings. According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are about 40% more likely to die from colon cancer than other groups and 70% more likely to die from prostate cancer.\n\nBoth candidates have rushed to popular podcasts as a strategy to reach undecided voters in this razor-thin contest.\n\nHarris and her allies have been keen on making direct appeals to Black men as surveys for months have shown Trump making slight gains with segments of that demographic. A recent ABC News/Ipsos survey, however, showed Harris winning 85% of the Black male vote.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\n‘Fixated on his grievances’: Harris responds to Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of “fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country” in response to the former president’s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden that included racist remarks from speakers.\n\n“Donald Trump's event in Madison Square Garden really highlighted a point that I've been making throughout this campaign,” Harris said Monday before boarding Air Force Two to head to Saginaw, Michigan.\n\n“He is focused and fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country and it is not in any way, something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker,” Harris said.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe, among the speakers at the Sunday night Madison Square Garden event in New York, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” and joked about a Black person in the crowd “carving watermelons.”\n\nConservative commentator Tucker Carlson provided a made-up ethnicity for Harris in his remarks, calling her “Samoan-Malaysian” and a “low IQ former California prosecutor.” In his speech, businessman Grant Cardone said Harris has “pimp handlers.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden casts last ballot as president\n\nPresident Joe Biden cast his early-voting ballot in the 2024 general election on Monday, his last as president.\n\nThe president waited in line at the Department of Elections office in Wilmington, Delaware, with about 50 people ahead of him. He chatted with people as he waited his turn.\n\nAfter casting his vote, he shook hands with few people and posed for a photo. Asked if the experience was bittersweet, he said it \"just sweet.\"\n\nBiden decided to abandon his plans to seek re-election in July after a disastrous debate performance, paving the way for his Vice President Kamala Harris to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus condemns Puerto Rico insults at Donald Trump's rally\n\nTony Hinchliffe, a comedian who called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" at a Trump rally Sunday night, was leveling \"a direct attack on countless hardworking Americans,\" a caucus representing Hispanic members of Congress said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"This type of language emboldens prejudice, encourages violence, and undermines the values of unity and respect that our country is built on,\" CHC Chair Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif. said. \"It’s deeply troubling to see Republican leaders celebrate this rhetoric instead of promoting unity and truth.\"\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus has an all-Democratic membership, while Republicans have their own Congressional Hispanic Conference.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nElon Musk and his PAC sued by Philadelphia DA over $1 million giveaway\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Elon Musk and his political action committee Monday to stop them from giving away $1 million each day to a swing state registered voter who signs their petition.\n\n\"America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens ... to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million,\" according to the legal complaint.\n\nThe lottery violates Pennsylvania's law requiring all lotteries in the state to be regulated by the government, according to the complaint. It also allegedly violates Pennsylvania consumer protection laws because Musk and his America PAC \"have not published a complete set of lottery rules or shown how they are protecting the privacy of participants’ personal information.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has already sent the PAC a warning letter, saying the giveaway could violate federal election law, according to a Wednesday CNN report. Federal law prohibits paying people to register to vote, and some legal experts say the giveaway could violate that law because you have to be registered to sign the petition.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Josh Meyer\n\nSteve Bannon to be released from prison Tuesday\n\nSteve Bannon, former White House chief strategist under the Trump administration, will be released from a Connecticut prison on Tuesday – a week out from Election Day – after serving a four month sentence.\n\nHe reported to prison for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was also fined $6,500.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nActress Kerry Washington says voters are 'the real fixers' at Wisconsin stop for Harris\n\nWisconsin needed handling. So the Harris campaign sent Kerry Washington.\n\nWashington, who played the fictional uber-fixer Olivia Pope on the hit ABC series \"Scandal,\" rallied Kamala Harris supporters on Sunday as an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll showed a dead heat in Wisconsin between the vice president and former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Harris campaign is leaving nothing to chance in the Midwest in the final days of the presidential race and has been putting every celebrity and national politician available on the road.\n\n\"You here in Wisconsin have the capacity to save the soul of this county, to really stand between us and a man who has said that he wants to be a dictator on day one, to stand between us and a man who said he wants generals more like Hitler’s generals,\" Washington told a roomful of Black women on Sunday at a private Harris campaign event at a cafe.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nCan early votes be counted before Election Day?\n\nLaws that dictate when early votes are received, processed and counted vary by state.\n\nSome places, like Alabama, Washington, D.C. and Idaho cannot begin counting votes until after the polls close on Election Day. Others, like Florida, Arizona and Nevada, can begin processing days before. Releasing results early is a felony in some states.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nVirginia asks Supreme Court to allow purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls\n\nVirginia Republicans have asked the Supreme Court to let them reinstate a purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed an emergency petition with the high court hours after a federal appeals court on Sunday upheld a lower court's ruling stopping the purge.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patricia Giles on Friday blocked a state program that had removed about 1,500 names since Aug. 7 because federal law prohibits voter purges within 90 days of an election. She also ordered the state to restore the registrations of those canceled during that period.\n\nMiyares told the high court that decision violates \"Virginia law and common sense.\" He asked for a high court decision by Tuesday.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Maureen Groppe\n\nDonald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally sparks backlash\n\nDonald Trump's campaign stops on Monday come after his highly-touted Madison Square Garden rally courted controversy. A warm-up act from a comedian sparked a political furor with a key constituency Trump is hoping to win over in his bid for a second term in the White House.\n\nDuring the early stages of the rally, the comedian Tony Hinchliffe, who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, mocked Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” and also said Latino people have too many children. While Trump's campaign later sought to distance itself from the joke, it had already garnered condemnation from fellow Republicans, major celebrities and others.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris would take cognitive test, says Trump should too\n\nHarris said she would take a cognitive test, and challenged Trump to take one as well, in an interview with CBS over the weekend.\n\nTrump called for Harris to take and \"pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility,\" in a post on Truth Social earlier this month. He wrote at the time, \"she is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions.\"\n\nHarris hit back, telling CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell, \"This is what he has resorted to.\n\n“And I think he actually is increasingly unstable and unhinged,” she continued, “and has resorted to name calling because he actually has no plan for the American people,\"\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate poll roundup: Republicans remain ahead in Montana, ties in Pennsylvania and Michigan\n\nSeveral new polls released Monday and over the weekend show Democrats have an advantage in Arizona and Wisconsin's Senate races, while Republicans have an edge Montana, Nebraska and Texas.\n\nAnd two new polls from InsiderAdvantage in Pennsylvania and Michigan show Senate races there in a statistical tie. In Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin has consistently polled a few percentage points ahead of her opponent, former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers.\n\nThe race in Pennsylvania has been tighter, with incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, typically polling around one percentage point above GOP candidate David McCormick.\n\nA poll from The Hill and Emerson College show Montana GOP candidate Tim Sheehy ahead of incumbent Sen.

Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nHow many days until Election Day?

JB Pritzker says Donald Trump “demonstrates all of the qualities of somebody who is using peoples’ fears to advance a cause that is antidemocratic” but declined on Sunday to directly label him a fascist.\n\n“You can put whatever label you want on it, but you’ve heard him say antidemocratic things,” Pritzker told USA TODAY. “And at the same time, he says things that are motivational to some of the worst elements of peoples’ thinking – racism, sexism, you know, xenophobia, the concern about immigrants and so on.”\n\nPritzker added, “So there’s no doubt that you can take some quotes of Donald Trump’s and read them in the most extreme texts that there are out there, and say, he must be reading those, or someone is telling him those, and he is drawn to them.”\n\nThe governor's comments came after former White House chief of staff John Kelly in an interview with The New York Times last week said the 2024 presidential candidate fits the bill for a fascist.\n\nLast year, after Trump pledged to root out fascists and referred to liberals as “vermin,\" Pritzker said the Republican’s comments were “frightening to those of us who know the history of Europe in the 1930s and 40s.” Kamala Harris said last week on CNN that she thinks Trump is a “fascist.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump-aligned group is already planning lawsuits over election results\n\nA Trump-aligned group that has filed lawsuits in several swing states challenging voter registration lists is already planning to sue over this year's election results, one of the group's founders told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We feel compelled to file in defense of this beautiful country,\" said Marly Hornik, who co-founded United Sovereign Americans in 2023. \"We already have signs and numbers coming in of errors inside of the process.\"\n\nThe organization, which describes itself as nonpartisan, is regularly represented by Bruce Castor, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Lawsuits from both the group and Republican organizations suggest widespread voter fraud could be happening – without providing proof that it is.\n\nThe claims feed into the false narrative from Trump that he didn't lose the 2020 election, which critics fear is a precursor to claiming similar election theft if he loses again. Numerous counts and audits showed President Joe Biden won the last presidential election. Nearly all of more than 60 lawsuits from Trump allies in the wake of that election failed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew polls show slim leads for Republicans in Nebraska and Texas Senate races\n\nNew polls from The New York Times/Siena College, conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 26, show tight Senate races in both Nebraska and Texas.\n\nIn Texas, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a Trump-endorsed, two-term incumbent is leading his Democratic opponent Rep. Colin Allred 50% to 46% among 1,180 voters in Texas, according to the poll. Democrats have been eyeing the seat as one they could possibly flip to keep control of the Senate, pouring millions of dollars into the race.\n\nIn Nebraska, Republican Sen.

Instead, the appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola for further review.\n\nGuirola had rejected the lawsuit in the July from the state and national Republican Parties that challenged the grace period approved during the COVID pandemic. “The upshot: These statutes ‘mandate holding all elections for Congress and the Presidency on a single day throughout the Union,’” Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the three-judge appeals panel.\n\nIf the case were appealed to the Supreme Court it could potentially have brought implications because more than a dozen states have grace periods for mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day to arrive up to 10 days afterward.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nCourt refuses to revive Virginia policy to remove suspected noncitizens from voter rolls\n\nA federal appeals court on Sunday rejected a Republican case from Virginia that sought to reinstate a purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patricia Giles on Friday had halted the state program that removed about 1,500 names since Aug. 7 because federal law prohibits removing names from voter rolls within 90 days of an election. She also ordered the registration of those who were removed to be restored.\n\nThe state appealed but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Giles’ ruling.\n\n\"For the second time in three days, a federal court ruled Virginia's purge of eligible citizens is unlawful,” said Ryan Snow, a lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “We urge the Supreme Court to stop this madness and make it clear that it is unacceptable to block eligible citizens from voting.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris and Trump locked in a dead heat in key battleground state, new poll shows\n\nA new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Trump and Harris are almost tied in Wisconsin, 48% to 47%, among 500 likely voters.

Puerto Rican voters living in the United States make up the second largest Latino group in the country, including in key battleground states like Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the face of a growing uproar, senior Trump advisor Danielle Alvarez on Sunday night issued a statement addressing Hinchcliffe's bit. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” she said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in national polls. Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, well within the margin of error of each survey included.\n\nIt's also a tight race in battleground states across the country. For example, according to Real Clear Politics' average of polls in Michigan, Trump leads by just 0.2 percentage points.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5.

I’m thrilled to have the backing of so many Democrats who recognize that it is time to put people over party.\"\n\nThe 10 people who identify as Democrats and publicly endorsed Kalus Tuesday were:\n\nFormer House Speaker Matthew Smith\n\nFormer North Providence Mayor Richard Fossa\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Ron Baccala\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Steve Loporchio\n\nFormer Providence state Rep. Joanne Giannini\n\nFormer Warwick Councilwoman Kathleen Egan Usler\n\nFormer Johnston Town Councilman Steve Macchioni\n\nFrank Demaio, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nDottie McCaffrey, former president of the Mount Pleasant Neighborhood Association\n\nPeter Marinucci, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nThe Kalus campaign paid Smith $500 in July for consultant and professional services, according to filings with the state Board of Elections.\n\nOCT. 19: Former RI Supreme Court Judge Flanders backs Kalus at press conference on McKee's emergency energy powers\n\nFormer Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders has sided with Republican candidate for governor Ashley Kalus' disputed contention that the governor has the power to roll back electricity and gas rate hikes.\n\nKalus has argued - and Flanders on Wednesday agreed - that Gov. Dan McKee has emergency powers granted under a 40-year-old law enacted after the gasoline shortages of the 1970s to roll back rate hikes of 47% in electricity and 15% in natural gas.\n\nDemocrat McKee contends the law - passed in the wake of severe gasoline shortages in the 1970's - applies to disruptions in energy supply only, not prices.\n\nStanding next to Kalus outside the State House on Wednesday, Flanders - a one-time GOP candidate for the U.S. Senate - disagreed with McKee's reading of the law, and Kalus accused McKee of rejecting the idea solely because she came up with it.\n\nHe told a press conference; the law applies \"whenever there is an abnormal energy related market disruption...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nAt such times, Flanders contended: \"the governor can issue an executive order declaring the existence of an energy crisis...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nHe said the Russian-Ukrainian war \"has caused large increases in market prices for gas and electricity\" that have created the kind of \"abnormal market conditions.\" that allow the governor rescind any orders handed down by the Public Utilities Commission, and defer the approved rates hikes until \"a later date when prices moderate or decrease which they are expected to do in the not to distant future.\"\n\nThat is not certain.\n\nOne of the reasons: The PUC requires Rhode Island Energy to buy supplies far in advance of when they’re needed to smooth out any price fluctuations in wholesale energy markets.\n\nThat means much of the supply for this winter was procured before the war in Ukraine, which has driven up prices of natural gas, a critical fuel for electricity generation in New England.\n\nBut Flanders - who was often on the dissenting side on Supreme Court decisions during his time on the high court - cited the emergency actions taken by McKee and his predecessor, former Gov. Gina Raimondo, during the \"public health emergency\" created by the pandemic as precedent.\n\nThe McKee administration stance: \"The Energy Crisis Management Act was passed in response to the energy crises and fuel shortage(s) of the 1970s and was intended to help manage the supply of energy, not energy prices.\"\n\n\"If the statute were improperly invoked to attempt to address energy prices, it would expose Rhode Island taxpayers to expensive and protracted litigation.\"\n\nAsked about the potential for lawsuits, Flanders said: \"You can't do anything these days without somebody potentially challenging you. So no one could give you a guarantee that somebody wouldn't challenge you...but I don't think they would be successful.\".\n\nOCT. 12: GOP Kalus' name change on campaign filings draws complaint to state elections board\n\nA 79-year-old Warwick man has asked the Rhode Island Board of Elections to sort out the name of the Republican candidate for governor: Ashley Weinzweig, as she called herself when she filed her initial paperwork as a candidate, or Ashley Kalus.\n\nFor the record: Kalus amended her initial February 7 \"notice of organization\" on March 14, to reflect the name change on her candidacy papers from her husband's last name, Weinzweig, to Kalus..\n\nRichard Langseth framed his complaint to the elections board as an \"objection to Ashley Weinzweig's amended notice of organization.\"\n\nHe said he did so after trying to trace Kalus' history in Rhode Island and finding her Newport home and her business filings were all under the name Weinzweig.\n\nThere has been no response yet from the Board of Elections to the filing, which touches on an issue familiar to professional women who chose to use their maiden names in some settings and their married names in others.\n\nOCT. 12: Magaziner pollster says Dem trails Fung by just 3 points\n\nAfter the latest public poll showed Republican Allan Fung leading Democrat Seth Magaziner by 8 points, a polling memo released by Magaziner's pollster Wednesday showed the gap a more manageable 3 points.\n\nThe polling memo from the Mellman Group, firm founded by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said the campaign's polling showed Fung with 43% of the vote, Magaziner 40%. Moderate Party Candidate William Gilbert with 5% and 12% undecided.\n\nThat would put Magaziner well within the 4.9% margin or error.\n\n\"With a month to go, undecideds are disproportionately likely to break for Magaziner, as there are four times as many undecided Democrats (54%) as Republicans (13%,) with a third (33%) independents,\" the memo said. \"With double digit undecideds four weeks out, this is a wide-open race.\"\n\nOCT. 7: State employees union endorses Democrats, except in treasurers race\n\nThe largest union for Rhode Island state workers, Council 94, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, endorsed Democrats on Friday for every statewide and federal office this year -- except general treasurer.\n\nThe union endorsed Republican James Lathrop, the finance director in North Kingstown, over Democrat James Diossa, the former mayor of Central Falls.\n\n\"Our decision was based on the fact that [Lathrop] is a CPA instead of a politician and wanted to just be treasurer, not use it as a stepping stone,\" Council 94 President J. Michael Downey said Friday. \"That was refreshing to us.\"\n\nDowney added that the union also had some reservations about Diossa's level of \"transparency\" around managing the Central Falls pension when he was mayor, and the temporary transfer of $500,000 out of the fund into municipal coffers. The transfer was raised as an issue by Diossa's opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\nAside from Lathrop, Council 94 endorsed almost entirely Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, including Dan McKee for governor, Sabina Matos for lieutenant governor, Peter Neronha for attorney general, Gregg Amore for secretary of state and David Cicilline and Seth Magaziner for Congress.\n\nIn General Assembly races, Council 94 endorsed former state Rep. Elizabeth Crowley, who is running as an independent, over Democratic incumbent Sen. Jonathon Acosta in Central Falls. And it endorsed Republican Anthony Deluca over Democrat Jennifer Rourke for Senate in Warwick.\n\nIn the House, the union endorsed independent Antonio Desimas over incumbent Democratic Rep. Brianna Henries of East Providence.\n\nOCT. 5: Magaziner goes after GOP on Social Security\n\nJOHNSTON -- Seth Magaziner Tuesday said if Republicans retake the House thanks to a victory by his opponent Allan Fung, they will try to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n\"The Republican agenda in Washington could not be more extreme on this issue,\" Magaziner told supporters at the Johnston Senior Center. \"Just this summer, the Republicans in Washington came out with something they called the Blueprint to Save America. That blueprint included raising the Social Security age. For most people that is already 67. How much longer do they want people to have to work?\"\n\nMagaziner's Johnston event was held to accept the endorsement from the National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare, a left-leaning group founded by the son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nCommittee to Protect Social Security PAC President Max Richtman said \"we've seen a lot of talk about sunsetting these programs.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound dangerous, but what it means is we start from scratch every five years,\" he said. \"Can you imagine that? Can you imagine how complicated it would be to recreate Social Security?\"\n\nIn television interviews, Fung has said Magaziner has \"distorted\" his position on Social Security which he said he does not want to cut.\n\nFung's campaign did not respond to Magaziner's comments Tuesday or questions about how he would fund Social Security and whether that could include raising the age when Americans can collect full Social Security benefits.\n\nAs evidence for the claim that Republicans would cut Social Security, Magaziner cited a plan that Rep. Kevin McCarthy worked on with former Speaker Paul Ryan a decade ago, which moved to privatize Social Security. McCarthy, who is expected to be speaker if the GOP retakes the House, has raised money and financed ads backing Fung in Rhode Island's second congressional district.\n\nThe Blueprint to Save America was released by the Republican Study Committee in June.\n\nAs for how he would shore up Social Security, Magaziner said he supports raising payroll taxes on people who make more than $400,000 per year. Currently earnings subject to the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are capped at $147,000 per year.\n\nSEPT. 27: McKee, Kalus at odds over need for special legislative session to suspend tax on electricity bills\n\nDays after Gov. Dan McKee promised to push legislation to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on electricity bills when lawmakers reconvene in January, his GOP opponent Ashley Kalus is asking: why wait?\n\nKalus renewed her earlier call for a special session to blunt the the impact of the big increase Rhode Islanders will see in their electric bills starting on Oct. 1, as a result of the approval last Friday, by state regulators, of the rate hike requested by the state’s largest energy company.\n\nHer Tweet: \"If @DanMcKeeRI cared about working families, seniors, & low-income Rhode Islanders, he would call the General Assembly in now for an emergency session to suspend the Gross Receipts Tax on electricity rather than wait until January.\"\n\nArticle IX of the state Constitution gives the governor the power to call the legislature - which closed up shop in June - back to the State House for an emergency legislative session.\n\nBut the governor and legislative leaders say it doesn't apply.\n\nWhen asked why Democrat McKee was not exercising this option, the governor's spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal: “The Governor’s legal counsel believes that the Governor currently does not have the authority to call the General Assembly back into session.”\n\nAsked to elaborate, he said: \" The Rhode Island General Assembly is not currently in adjournment. It has the power to come back into session at any time. We read the Governor’s constitutional power to convene a special session as applicable only when the General Assembly is in adjournment. \"\n\nIn their own joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said: “The Governor currently is not constitutionally empowered to convene the General Assembly.”\n\nThey did not explain the basis for their conclusion, though John Marion, executive director of the citizens' advocacy group Common Cause, suggested the Constitution may not apply in years, such as now, when the General Assembly has recessed, rather than adjourned. No court has ruled on this.\n\nA day earlier: Sheaff said the governor, nonetheless, \"continues to be committed to providing relief for all Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nHe said McKee advocated against the rate increase and redirected $3.8 million in Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative funds to \"direct rate relief\" for low-income customers.\n\nBeyond that, he said McKee is \"renewing his proposal to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on all electricity bills through the April 2023 utility billing period, which is the last month that winter electricity rates will be reflected in constituents’ utility bills.\"\n\n\"Additionally,\" Sheaff said, \"the governor proposed 2 relief tools that would apply to all ratepayers – both were approved by the PUC: 1) Suspending the customer charge on electric bills 2) Distributing $32 million in settlement credits with the Attorney General back to ratepayers.”\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212.\n\nAs a result, however, of moves taken so far, \"We have effectively eliminated the impact for our most vulnerable constituents, and they will not see an increase in their overall electric bills when compared to last winter,\" McKee said earlier.\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212. .\"\n\nIt is unclear how much the suspension of the 4% gross receipts tax might shave off the new rates approved Friday by the state's Public Utilities Commission.\n\nAsked how much revenue the state would forgo, Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi told The Journal: \"The estimate we have is a revenue loss of around $42 million to $47 million for a six-month waiver of the gross receipts tax on electricity.\"\n\nKalus contends: \"Dan McKee wants to hold relief for Rhode Islanders hostage until after November.\"\n\nMcKee's campaign has not responded.\n\nKalus first raised the idea of a special session to suspend the gross receipts tax in a July 23 Tweet, soon after The Journal published a story about the rate hikes filed with state regulators by Rhode Island Energy.\n\nMcKee spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal Tuesday night that \"suspension of the gross receipts tax was one of the proposals that Governor McKee brought to legislative leaders during their weekly meetings to discuss potential ways to provide relief to Rhode Islanders with the surplus.\"\n\n\"At that time it was not clear exactly what the increase would be so it was decided that this proposal would be reviewed at the beginning of the [next] legislative session. \"\n\nLegislative spokesman Larry Berman said House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi recalls this coming up during their May meetings. He said: \"This will be addressed in January.\"\n\nSEPT. 21: Former Republicans stump for Magaziner\n\nClaudine Schneider, who was a Republican when she represented Rhode Island in Congress, was among five GOP defectors to endorse Democrat Seth Magaziner Wednesday.\n\n“The Republican Party of today is not the same Republican Party it was when I represented the Rhode Island second congressional district in the 1980s,\" Schneider said in a news release. \"The GOP in Washington has become the party of insurrectionist Donald Trump, and it is directly at odds with the values of Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nSchneider, the first woman to represent Rhode Island in Congress, currently lives in Colorado.\n\nThe other former Republicans to endorse Magaziner were Republican State Sen. Dawson Hodgson, former State Rep. Robert Nardolillo, Cranston Councilman Robert Ferri, and former gubernatorial candidate Vincent Marzullo.\n\nHodgson will support Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House, and this is unacceptable,\" Hodgson said. \"McCarthy voted to overturn the 2020 election, in direct opposition to the Constitution that we all hold dear.\"\n\nSEPT. 20: Warwick Democrat delivers Chamber endorsement to GOP's Fung\n\nWARWICK -- He may be a Democrat, but in his day job Warwick City Council President Stephen McAllister is a regional vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnd the U.S. Chamber, unlike some local chambers, leans to the right.\n\nSo in a week of post-primary Democratic unity, it was McAllister who joined Republican Allan Fung to deliver the Chamber's endorsement of the former Cranston mayor, who is trying to flip Rhode Island's second congressional district to the GOP.\n\n\"Our number one goal is to send people like Allan to Washington D.C. that want to roll up their sleeves and get to work,\" McAllister said Tuesday sitting next to Fung. \"Big things can happen when Congress gets together, negotiates and moves things forward.\"\n\nThe big things McAllister had in mind were the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year and the \"CHIPS Act\" to boost the semi-conductor industry, which passed earlier this year.\n\nFung says he supported both bills, which were passed by a Democratic Congress and opposed by House GOP leadership, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy raised money for Fung and controls a PAC running negative ads against Democratic nominee Seth Magaziner. (The CHIPS Act was spearheaded by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has defeated Fung in the last two Rhode Island gubernatorial elections.)\n\nMcAllister declined to commit to voting for Fung personally in November, but said he supports the Chamber's political agenda.\n\nFung accepted the Chamber endorsement at Brewed Awakenings on Bald Hill Road, across the street from GOP governor nominee Ashley Kalus' campaign headquarters.\n\nAnd he took the opportunity to hammer away increases in the cost of living over the past year under Democratic control of Washington, his top campaign issue.\n\n\"Coming to Washington D.C. hopefully in January I want to bring common sense solutions, making sure we are focused on the right things to get our economy going, cut a lot of this crazy spending and drive down inflation.\" Fung said.\n\nHe did not provide any new details of what policies, if elected, he would pursue to reduce inflation, beyond cutting \"wasteful spending.\"\n\nAsked what spending should be cut, Fung mentioned the Presidio tunnel project in San Francisco he blasted at his campaign announcement in April and said last year's American Rescue Plan provided too much money to states. But he doesn't want try to claw that money back from state coffers.\n\nLike government spending, tax cuts are also inflationary, and Fung says he would not rule out voting for tax cuts if the GOP retakes Congress.\n\n\"I am going to take a look at everything that will help, not just business owners, but residents in general,\" Fung said. \"If that means tax cuts that benefits all walks of life, sure I will take a look at it.\"\n\nHe did not answer when asked what he thinks of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flying migrants to New England, a topic that has dominated national news coverage this week.\n\nMagaziner responded to the U.S. Chamber endorsement by saying he would stand with workers instead of corporations.\n\n“Allan Fung is showing his true colors yet again, standing with billion-dollar corporate lobbyists who oppose the Affordable Care Act and any efforts to crack down on the price gouging that is hurting Rhode Islanders at the gas pump,\" Magaziner said in an email. \"Tonight, I will proudly accept the support of the AFL-CIO which represents 80,000 workers across the state of Rhode Island. In Congress, I will stand with working Rhode Islanders, while Allan Fung stands with the corporate lobbyists.”\n\nSEPT. 19: Congressional delegation endorses Magaziner\n\nRhode Island's all-Democratic congressional delegation Monday joined the party's post-primary effort to unify behind Seth Magaziner in the race against Republican Allan Fung.\n\nIn Johnston, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. David Cicilline and Jim Langevin were joined by Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena and the Democrats Magaziner beat in the primary to stump for him.\n\n“Seth has served the second congressional district for the last eight years, fixing crumbling school buildings and creating clean energy jobs from Westerly to Burrillville,\" Langevin, whose decision not to run for reelection set off the battle for the Second District seat.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, who part of the House Democratic leadership team, was more more blunt.\n\n\"Allan Fung will be a vote for the national Republicans dead set on passing a national abortion ban, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors rely on,\" Cicilline said. \"In the House, the majority party controls the agenda and decides which bills see the light of day.\"\n\nReed said \"a vote to send Allan Fung to Congress is a vote to empower Trump Republicans and tighten Trump's chokehold on our democracy.”\n\nThe congressional delegation event comes after the state party on Sunday night held a unity dinner in Warwick to bring statewide candidates together after the primary including the candidates for governor.\n\nAnd it comes as the national GOP targets Rhode Island's Second District as one of its top potential pickup targets as it tries to win back a majority in the House.\n\nA Super PAC controlled by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who visited Rhode Island to raise money for Fung this summer, spent $1 million on advertising in the district.\n\nA television spot from the Congressional Leadership Fund now airing in Rhode Island accuses Magaziner of using family money to \"buy his way into office.\"\n\nSEPT. 12: Former RI Health Director Alexander-Scott endorses Foulkes for governor\n\nA day ahead of Tuesday's five-way Democratic primary, former Rhode Island Health Director Nicole Alexander-Scott endorsed former CVS executive Helena Foulkes for governor over the incumbent, Dan McKee.\n\nIn a statement explaining why she is backing Foulkes over McKee, who was her boss until she gave two-weeks notice that she was leaving in January, Alexander-Scott said:\n\n\"For Rhode Island to be best equipped to handle the next crisis, the state cannot stay with the status quo. Early on, I saw how critical it was to have a Governor with vision, integrity, a listening ear, and a willingness to be accountable.\n\n\"Rhode Island needs change and needs new leadership. Helena Foulkes is the leader Rhode Island needs.\"\n\nThis was the response from the McKee campaign: \"Helena Foulkes is trying to change the conversation away from her role in fueling the opioid crisis and the nearly billion dollars in settlements that CVS now has to pay because of her negligent 'leadership'.\"\n\nIn February 2021, before McKee took office, \"Rhode Island received an F from Harvard on its vaccination rollout. Rhode Island was in the bottom 10 states nationwide per capita for deaths. The NY Times had Rhode Island dead last for share of its population that has received at least one vaccine dose and percentage of doses used.\n\n\"Governor McKee’s leadership changed that,\" campaign spokeswoman Alana O'Hare said. \"He partnered with municipalities and prioritized teachers to get shots off the shelves and into arms, and our state is now the most vaccinated in the nation.\"\n\n\"Gov. McKee’s record speaks for itself,\" she said.\n\nBut Alexander-Scott's deputy, Tom McCarthy, who resigned shortly after she did, pushed back with this Tweet:\n\n\"Unreal, it was a challenge to get the Governor to listen to and understand the FACTS let alone make a decision. It was easier to prop up a “whacky, waving inflatable arm” blow up at a car dealership than stiffen his spine to make a real decision.\"\n\nAlexander-Scott, who was hired by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2015, never publicly explained why she quit before the end of her appointed term. She was given a $46,000 a month consulting gig - described as a \"transition services agreement\" - that ran from March 1 through May 31.\n\nMcKee's rivals in the race for governor blamed him for the departure, with one saying it \"signals a lack of confidence in [McKee's] leadership and handling of COVID-19.\"\n\nBut others in state government, including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, said Alexander-Scott had privately told them that \"she's given all that she can to the job\" and she's just ready to move on.\n\nAnd McKee said at the time he regretted her leaving: “Her leadership has been crucial to our whole of government response — helping Rhode Island become number one in testing nationwide and getting more people vaccinated per capita than nearly any other state in the country,\" he said in a statement issued by his office.\n\nThere has been no response yet from McKee to Alexander-Scott's political shot at him and his administration.\n\nIn her statement, released by the Foulkes campaign, she said: \"Please do not let Tuesday pass without doing your part to ensure that Rhode Island has a leader who is ready to tackle the challenges lying ahead in education, housing, employment, and so many other areas.\n\nIn July, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials announced that Alexander-Scott had been hired as a \"senior executive consultant...[to] lead the creation of a national office that will serve as a resource hub for state, territorial, county, and local governments and public health agencies to effectively invest in communities using evidence-informed, place-based, community-led interventions.\"\n\nSEPT. 9: Elorza calls for removal of ExpressVote machines ahead of primary\n\nOn Friday, Mayor Jorge Elorza called for the ExpressVote machines to be removed ahead of the primary, putting the request in writing to Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and the Board of Elections.\n\n“I just have very little faith that everything is going to be ready to go by Election Day, and so I think it’s prudent at this time to just pull these ExpressVote machines and get everything ready for the general election,” Elorza said.\n\nThe mayor said existing machines, which are not the ExpressVote machines, “are more than enough to handle the volume of voters” in the primary, calling the ExpressVote machines unnecessary.\n\nVarious errors have been uncovered on Spanish language ballots shown on the machines, including the erroneous lists of candidates. Lists from the 2018 cycle were shown on some ballots, which included Elorza’s name. He is term-limited and not remain in office next year.\n\nElorza said he isn’t sure whether the Board of Elections has formally adopted a verification process, calling it a concern.\n\nThis comes after Elorza exchanged letters over the issue with Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, who is running for governor. Elorza has endorsed her opponent, Helena Foulkes.\n\nIn his letter, Elorza appeared to hold Gorbea responsible for the fiasco, along with the Board of Elections.\n\nIn her letter, Gorbea said responsibility lies with the Board of Elections, adding that she trusts Elorza’s statements were not made because of his endorsement of Foulkes.\n\n“That was upsetting,” Elorza said of Gorbea’s remarks. “I mean, come on. This has been a string of issues that continue to come out day after day after day, and it’s incumbent upon them. What I’m asking them to do is to ensure that we have a fair and accurate election.”\n\nIn a subsequent statement, Gorbea's campaign manager Dana Walton made an even stronger comment than the candidate herself had made, describing Elorza's press conference as a \"political stunt days before an election to help out Mayor Elorza’s endorsed candidate.\" Walton added that the Board of Elections held a public meeting on Wednesday when Elorza could have noted his concerns.\n\nIn a letter after his announcement, the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause Rhode Island released a statement demanding Elorza retract his call for the removal of the machines, stating it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\"Voters with disabilities have a right to use a machine that can assist them voting their ballot, and the ExpressVote is that machine,\" said RIACLU Director Steven Brown.\n\nElorza said he asked the Secretary of State and Board of Elections \"whether these are the only ADA accessible machines\" and if so, to ensure people with disabilities have the option not to use them. The mayor says he hopes there's already a backup plan.\n\nSEPT. 1: Teachers union endorses LaFortune for Providence mayor\n\nThe Providence Teachers Union on Thursday endorsed Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune for mayor, pointing to her city experience and background as a public school graduate.\n\n\"Nirva’s impressive qualifications, her unique connection with our schools and her commonsense ideas to take our public schools to the next level after the state takeover ends, make her the clear choice for mayor,\" the union said.\n\nThe endorsement comes just after LaFortune released a plan to become what she called \"Providence's education mayor.\" LaFortune aims to end the state's takeover of public schools, establish a teacher residency program, and fix up and construct new school buildings, among a host of other initiatives.\n\nThe union said LaFortune would serve as \"a partner at City Hall, instead of an adversary.\"\n\nOther union endorsements in the race include Gonzalo Cuervo's firefighters union endorsement and Brett Smiley's painters union endorsement.\n\nAUG. 24: Two governor candidates added to Nov. ballot\n\nThe Rhode Island Board of Elections Wednesday added two candidates for governor -- libertarian Elijah Gizzarelli and independent Paul Rianna Jr. -- to the November general election ballot.\n\nThe BOE had previously ruled Gizzarelli was 14 nomination signatures short of the 1,000 needed to get on the ballot ,and Rianna 42 signatures short.\n\nBut the Board restored dozens of signatures for the candidates that local boards of canvassers had rejected, giving them enough to qualify for the ballot.\n\nGizzarelli and Rianna wil join the winners of the September 13 Democratic and Republican primaries on the November ballot and independent Zachary Hurwitz.\n\nAUG. 24: NRA gives few endorsements, many F's to RI candidates\n\nThe National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund has endorsed five Rhode Island House candidates in its 2022 report card for the upcoming elections and dished out \"F\" grades to General Assembly leaders after they passed a ban on high capacity magazines this year.\n\nThe new NRA grades include an \"F\" for formerly \"A\" rates Senate president Dominick Ruggerio, a gun owner and Second Amendment advocate in the past.\n\nOut of dozens of competitive races and hundreds of candidates the gun rights group endorsed:Republican Rep. Barbara Ann Fenton-Fung of Cranston, Democratic Rep. Camille Vella-Winkinson of Warwick, Rep. Edward Cardillo of Johnston, Rep. Robert Phillips of Woonsocket and Democratic House challenger Natalya Delsanto of Cranston. Delsanto is challenging Rep. Brandon Potter, whom the NRA gave an \"F.\"\n\nThe NRA made no endorsements in any of the statewide races, including the governor's race. It gave Democratic candidates Gov. Dan McKee, Helena Foulkes and Nellie Gorbea \"F\" grades. Matt Brown and Luis Daniel Muñoz received a \"?\" grade.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus also received a \"?.\" Her primary opponent got a \"B,\" but no endorsement.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Democrats Sabina Matos, Cynthia Mendes and Deborah Ruggiero all got \"Fs\"\n\nAlong with Ruggerio, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also received a \"F.\"\n\nReps. Charlene Lima, D-Cranston; Joseph Solomon, D-Warwick and Arthur Corvese, D-North Providence, received \"Bs.\"\n\nSens. Frank Ciccone, D-Providence; Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston and Frank Lombardo, D-Johnston, also got \"Bs\" from the NRA.\n\nAUG. 10: Matos hits Ruggiero over matching funds\n\nSparring in the lieutenant governor's race escalated Wednesday when Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos -- needled earlier in the week for debate ducking -- accused Democratic primary opponent Deborah Ruggiero of improperly seeking public campaign funding.\n\nThe complaint sent to the state Board of Elections from Matos campaign manager Evan England said Ruggiero had exceeded the amount of money a candidate can loan their campaign and receive state matching funds.\n\nThe state matching fund program limits how much candidates can spend while claiming public dollars and how much of that money -- 5% -- can come from personal funds. The Matos complaint calculates the limit for personal loans in a lieutenant governor race this year to be $43,233.\n\nIn March, Ruggiero loaned her campaign $15,000, which would not exceed the limit, but she had nearly $42,000 in her campaign account from her time as a state representative. Carrying those existing campaign funds over into the lieutenant governor campaign counts as a loan that would bring her total to around $57,000, the complaint alleges.\n\n\"When Rep. Ruggiero applied for taxpayer funds for her campaign, she agreed to follow certain rules,\" Matos campaign consultant Mike Raia wrote in an email. \"It's clear she has violated those rules.\"\n\nRuggiero spokesman Joe Caiazzo Wednesday night said the issue has been resolved.\n\nHe forwarded an email sent from Board of Elections Campaign Finance Director Richard Thornton to Ruggiero three hours after the Matos complaint was filed directing her to \"repay yourself for the loan made to the campaign to the extent necessary to comply with the [matching funds] pledge.\"\n\nAssuming the money, which comes out to around $14,000, is refunded, the letter from Thornton does not suggest Ruggiero will have any issue receiving matching funds.\n\nCaiazzo said Ruggiero will comply.\n\n\"This is another attempt by the Matos campaign to divert from the issues that actually matter to Rhode Islanders,\" Caiazzo wrote in an email. \"It is unfortunate she will not engage in dialogue and participate in debates.\"\n\nThe campaign finance complaint comes after Ruggiero attacked Matos earlier in the week for refusing to participate in more than one debate this year.\n\nRuggiero and fellow lieutenant governor candidate Sen. Cynthia Mendes taped a debate at WPRO-radio Tuesday that Matos declined to attend over a scheduling conflict.\n\n\"It is disappointing to see Sabina Matos and her team ignore our calls for debate participation,\" Ruggiero said in a news release Monday. \"Their previous remarks are dismissive and demeaning to all Rhode Islanders.\n\nMatos enjoys a healthy financial advantage in the race with $316,000 in her campaign account as of June 30 compared to $140,000 for Ruggiero. Matos is not seeking public matching funds in the race.\n\nMendes is also running in the Democratic primary and is seeking matching funds.\n\nAUG. 9: Seth Magaziner moves to second congressional district\n\nSeven months after launching his campaign for Congress, Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner has moved to the Second Congressional District he hopes to represent, his campaign said Tuesday.\n\nMagaziner moved from the East Side of Providence to Cranston's Edgewood neighborhood, campaign spokeswoman Patricia Socarras said.\n\nMagaziner will be renting a townhouse on Norwood Avenue on a block that dead-ends at Roger Williams Park. The move was first reported by the Boston Globe.\n\nThe move allowed Magaziner to register in the Second District so he can vote for himself ahead of the voter registration deadline.\n\nMagaziner grew up in the East Bay, which is in the First District, and some of Magaziner's election opponents have attacked him for not being from the district he wants to represent.\n\nSocarras said Magaziner plans to put his East Side home on the market to sell, but it has not been listed yet.\n\nAUG. 6: McCarthy visits Fung in RI\n\nKevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in Rhode Island Saturday to meet and presumably raise money for second congressional district candidate Allan Fung.\n\n\"Great day with a great candidate. Let’s turn #RI02 red @AllanFungRI,\" McCarthy, of California, tweeted around 4 p.m. with a photo of himself and Fung, dressed in nearly matching white shirts, khaki pants and navy blue blazers, standing on a manicured lawn overlooking Narragansett Bay.\n\nThe Fung campaign has not responded to questions about McCarthy's visit or where the anticipated fundraising event was held.\n\nThe Democrats hoping to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in Washington next year, however, blasted the alliance.\n\n“MAGA Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy supports privatizing Social Security, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and passing a national abortion ban, \" Patricia Socarras, spokeswoman for Seth Magaziner wrote in an email. \"The fact McCarthy is campaigning for Allan Fung in RI confirms what we already knew— Fung and the extremists Republicans would be a disaster for Rhode Island seniors, Rhode Islander workers and Rhode Island women.”\n\nBryan McNamara, spokesman for Sarah Morgenthau, wrote that Fung is “rolling out the red carpet for Kevin McCarthy and his radical far-right agenda, proving once again he is out-of-touch with the voters of the Second District.”\n\nJames Singer, regional press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tweeted: \"Can make a promise: Democrats will make sure voters see this photo again and again #ri02.\"\n\nAUG. 1: Gorbea says she's still the frontrunner, according to her polster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea's says a new poll she commissioned shows her leading the race for governor by five percentage points.\n\nIn a poll of likely Democratic primary conducted last week, 27% of respondents prefered Gorbea compared to 22% for Dan McKee, 14% for Helena Buonanno Foulkes, 7% for Matt Brown and 3% for Luis Daniel Muñoz, according to a polling memo from Gorbea pollster Celinda Lake. The Gorbea campaign did not release the full poll including what questions were asked.\n\nAccording to the Lake polling memo, 53% of likely voters view Gorbea favorably, compared to 49% who view McKee favorably and 33% who view Foulkes favorably.\n\nThe last public poll of the Democratic primary, done in late June, showed Gorbea at 24%, McKee 20% and Foulkes 16%.\n\nThe last time Gorbea released select results of a poll was in April and showed her with 30% of the vote, compared to 24% for McKee, 10% for Brown and 7% for Foulkes.\n\nIn her polling memo Lake emphasized Gorbea's lead over Foulkes who, while still trailing, in most recent polls has been gaining ground.\n\n\"Despite Foulkes heavy spending on television advertising, she is a distant third,\" Lake wrote.\n\nLate last week Foulkes announced a set of prominent endorsements including Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza.\n\nThe polling memo shows a large chunk of the electorate -- 22% -- remains undecided on who they would support for governor.\n\nJULY 25: AFL-CIO and state's largest teachers' union endorse McKee\n\nGov. Dan McKee on Monday continued to rack up support from organized labor with the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and National Education Association Rhode Island teachers' union endorsing him.\n\nGeorge Nee, president of Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said since McKee assumed the governorship in March, 2021, he has signed labor-friendly bills that raise the minimum wage, require greenhouse gas emission reductions, set minimum staffing levels at nursing homes and require state-backed construction projects to pay a prevailing wage.\n\n\"Gov. McKee has consistently demonstrated a commitment to making life better for working Rhode Islanders,\" Nee said in a news release. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the McKee Administration on issues that affect not only the 80,000 men and women of the Rhode Island labor movement but all of the Ocean State’s working people.”\n\nThe NEARI endorsement was perhaps more of a surprise and comes despite McKee's long-standing support for charter schools, which has put him at odds with the union over the years. Last year McKee helped block a union-backed moratorium on new charter schools in Rhode Island.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, McKee pushed to have teachers vaccinated for COVID-19 before the general public at a point in the pandemic when doses were scarce.\n\nSeeing organized labor line up behind the incumbent in a Democratic primary is not a surprise, especially in this election year where state governments across the country have had the opportunity to dole out billions of dollars in federal COVID aid.\n\n“Governor McKee put his money where his mouth is by ensuring funding for public school construction and even finally paying off an old debt owed by the state to the pension system,” NEARI President Larry Purtill said in a news release. “There have been, and still are, areas where we disagree with the Governor and frankly, all his rivals. However, communication with the McKee Administration has steadily become more active and robust as he accrues time in the role of governor.”\n\nThe release also credited McKee with responding to \"issues at the Community College of Rhode Island, by placing Purtill on the Council on Postsecondary Education.\n\nThe 12,000-member NEARI is the largest teachers' union in the state.\n\nJULY 20: McKee wins UNAP endorsement\n\nGov. Dan McKee has won the endorsement of the United Nurses and Allied Professionals.\n\nIn making the announcement on Wednesday, UNAP - which describes itself as Rhode Island's largest health care workers' union with more than 5,500 members - thanked McKee for steering millions in federal Coronavirus relief dollars towards health care workers and hospitals.\n\n“In less than a year and a half, Governor McKee has delivered big results for health care workers,” said Lynn Blais, President of the UNAP, in a statement released by the union.\n\n“He kept us and our patients safe during the worst of COVID by mandating the vaccine for health care workers. He’s made workplace development in the health care field a top priority, with a focus on alleviating hospital staffing issues, which have plagued us for years.\n\nAnd \"he worked with General Assembly leaders to deliver real financial relief in the form of ARPA funding and increased Medicaid reimbursements for our hospitals, keeping them out of the hands of the for-profit vultures looking to make a profit at the expense of health care workers and patients.\n\nThe union also credited him for the \"major investments'' in the new state budget for the state-run Eleanor Slater Hospital, including \"money for a new medical facility, upgrades to existing buildings and the development of a long-awaited electronic medical records system.”\n\nMcKee also presided over the award of recrutiment and mentoring bonuses -ranging from $500 to $10,000 - on top of the $3,000 bonsues given other state employees - fornew nurses and certified nursing assistants at the Slater Hospital, the Rhode Island Veterans Home and the medical wing of the state prison.\n\nIn her statement, Blais said: McKee \" has earned our endorsement through his actions to help not just nurses and health professionals, but the entire health care community in Rhode Island, and we look forward to supporting him in the Democratic Primary and beyond.”\n\nJULY 17: Magaziner leads congressional fundraising\n\nSeth Magaziner continues to raise more money than any other candidate seeking to replace the retiring Jim Langevin representing Rhode Island's Second Congressional District, according to the latest quarterly filings with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nDemocrat Magaziner had $1.7 million in his campaign account at the end of June. So far this year he has raised $2.1 million and spent $400,000.\n\nMagaziner's donors are a who's who of Rhode Island industry and political influencers. They include former Fleet bank chief Terrence Murray, former IGT chairman Donald Sweitzer, former congressman Patrick Kennedy, Cornish Associates founder Arnold \"Buff\" Chace, Rhode Island Convention Center Chairman Bernie Buonanno Jr. and state Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin.\n\nHe also collected donations from political action committees representing unions such as Unite Here, International Union of Operating, Engineers, United Food and Commercial Workers, Plumbers and Pipefitters and the Laborers International Union.\n\nRepublican Allan Fung had second largest campaign warchest at the end of the second quarter, with $762,000. Fung has raised $857,000 so far this year, loaned his campaign $50,000 and spent $145,000.\n\nFung's donors include Carlos Trujillo, a Federalist Society contributor who was U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States under President Donald Trump. Fung also received $5,000 from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers PAC and $14,000 from members of the Tasca family that own auto dealerships.\n\nDemocrat Sarah Morgenthau had $621,000 in the bank. She has raised $692,000 so far this year, loaned her campaign $200,000 and spent $271,000.\n\nShe received $5,000 from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Off the Sidelines PAC and $1,000 from California Congressman Adam Schiff’s Frontline USA PAC.\n\nMost of her support came from out of state with only around two dozen individual donors from Rhode Island.\n\nDemocrat David Segal had $325,000 in the bank. He has raised $404,000, loaned his campaign $65,000 and spent $144,000 so far this year.\n\nLike Morgenthau. Segal also received most of his from out of state.\n\nHis Rhode Island donors included State Rep. John Lombardi and Providence City Council member Rachel Miller.\n\nDemocrat Joy Fox had $173,000 in the bank. She raised $281,000 and spent $108,000 so far this year.\n\nSome of her notable Rhodedonors included former lieutenant governor Elizabeth Roberts, former state Department of Human Services Director Courtney Hawkins and former candidate for governor Myrth York.\n\nNo second quarter campaign finance report was posted on the FEC website for Democrat Omar Bah as of Sunday.\n\nJULY 11: Morgenthau gets Booker endorsement\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker endorsed Sarah Morgenthau for Congress on Monday as the Democrats running for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat continue to tout support from prominent Washington lawmakers.\n\nMorgenthau, who quit a job in the Biden administration to run for Congress, worked on Booker's successful 2006 campaign for mayor of Newark.\n\n\"I have known Sarah for years. She had faith in me at a time few others did, and came to work for my mayoral campaign in Newark, which was no easy thing,” Booker said in a news release. “I am asking the voters of Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District to have the same faith in Sarah Morgenthau that she had in me. Sarah is hardworking, compassionate, and knows how to get things done in Washington.\"\n\nMorgenthau's Booker endorsement comes after Treasurer Seth Magaziner two weeks ago announced the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who holds the seat the candidates are trying to fill.\n\nMagaziner also received an endorsement from Massachusetts 4rth District Congressman Jake Auchincloss last week.\n\nBack in April, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren endorsed David Segal for Rhode Island's 2nd District and held an online fundraiser for him at the end of last month.\n\nJULY 8: Construction unions hit the air for McKee\n\nUnlike his Democratic primary rivals, Gov. Dan McKee hasn't done any campaign advertising so far this year and thanks to local building trades unions may not need to very soon.\n\nThe Rhode Island Building Trades Council on Friday launched television ads backing McKee Friday and thanking him for recent rounds of state spending programs.\n\n\"Since taking office, Gov. Dan McKee has delivered an historic investment in much-needed affordable housing. He's taken the lead on historic school construction projects,\" the ad said. \"So while some candidates have talked a good game, Dan McKee has delivered historic results.\"\n\nHaving the unions run independent ads backing you shows the power of incumbency and the political advantages of being in control of a $13 billion state budget.\n\nMichael Sabitoni, president of the Building Trades Council, said Friday that the unions' support for McKee was a result of what he has delivered for them since taking office last year.\n\n\"At the end of the day he gets an 'A' from us since he has been in office,\" Sabitoni said. \"Everything he has done with Covid, everything he has done with the state employees.\"\n\n\"All the other people say they are going to do this, they are going to do that. He has already done it,\" he added. \"There is only one person who has submitted a budget and had the General Assembly pass a budget.\"\n\nSaboitoni said the current ad will run \"two or three weeks\" and that there would be another ad coming focusing on infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Board of Elections, the Building Trades Council spent $100,000 placing the ad with the television networks and cable.\n\nEarlier this week Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea's campaign released a new ad describing her housing plan.\n\nAnd she announced the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 328.\n\nJUNE 24-26: House speaker, Senate president endorse McKee in crowded race for governor\n\nAhead of the state Democratic Party's endorsement convention on Sunday night, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio have gone public with their choice in the crowded race for governor: Dan McKee, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ruggerio issued a statement, announcing his endorsement of McKee for Governor and Sabina Matos for Lieutenant Governor.\n\nIn his statement, Ruggerio said, McKee and Matos, his appointed successor as lieutenant governor, \"have been effective partners with the Senate over the past year and a half, and they have helped to deliver results that will benefit the people and small businesses of our state now and into the future.\"\n\n“Dan McKee was thrust into the Governor’s office during a difficult time, amid a pandemic, and he rose to meet the challenge,\" RUggerio said.\n\n\"We worked collaboratively to ensure Rhode Islanders struggling under the weight of inflation saw immediate, tangible relief by eliminating the car tax, providing child tax credits, expanding low-income property tax breaks, and much more.\n\n\"Governor McKee is attuned to the challenges facing small businesses in Rhode Island, and he has succeeded in addressing many of these challenges, taking action to mitigate the worker shortage, improve workforce training, and reduce taxes,\" he said.\n\n“Lieutenant Governor Matos has provided indispensable leadership throughout her time in the lieutenant governor’s office,\" he added, citing several examples. Among them: \"Her work on housing, which has been a primary focus, has helped our state make historic progress.\"\n\nOn Friday, on the day after the close of the six-month legislative session – and round after round of negotiations with McKee's team, Shekarchi publicly endorsed McKee for election to the job to which he ascended in March 2021 after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post.\n\n“I appreciate his leadership and ability to collaborate with the legislature on such key issues as the landmark Act on Climate bill to protect our precious environment, as well as making key investments in education, health care and assisting our small businesses,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"We have an excellent working relationship which resulted in a great budget for all Rhode Islanders this year,\" added Shekarchi, citing the elimination of the car tax a year ahead of schedule, expanded tax credits for seniors and disabled people, and a tax credit for working families with children.\n\n“The Governor and I [also] share the mutual goal of increasing affordable housing opportunities for all Rhode Islanders, which is evident by the $250 million in housing investments contained in the budget, and we worked together on a comprehensive package of new housing bills.\"\n\nShekarchi will not have a direct vote on the endorsements the Democratic State Committee will hand out on Sunday night. But the speaker traditionally has had significant sway as the chosen leader of the Democrat-dominated House of representatives.\n\nThe explanation lies in the math: The committee's voting members include a state committeeman and a state committeewoman from each of the 75 House Districts, which equates to 150 of the 250 voting members.\n\nMcKee is facing four Democratic challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and health-care advocate Luis Daniel Muñoz.\n\nWinning the endorsement will require more than 50% of those voting.\n\nOn Saturday, Shekarchi also endorsed current state Treasurer Seth Magaziner for R.I.'s 2nd Congressional District seat.\n\n\"I am strongly supporting Seth Magaziner to fight against the radical views in Washington that are clearly out of step with Rhode Islanders,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"Having worked well with Seth as our General Treasurer for the past eight years, I can attest to his intelligence, character and strength that will serve us so well in Congress. We need Seth to join with Senator [Jack] Reed, Senator [Sheldon] Whitehouse and Congressman [David] Cicilline to carry forth the Democratic values that are so critical to our future as a state and a nation.\"\n\nThe Speaker has not [yet] weighed in on the primary race between Democrats Stefan Pryor and James Diossa to succeed Magaziner as treasurer.\n\nBut Pryor, who was until this past Tuesday the state's commerce secretary, won an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building & Construction Trades Council, a coalition of 16 local trade unions .\n\n“I have seen first hand Stefan Pryor’s work creating economic development. He created thousands of local union construction jobs, and his record is second to none. He is running a serious campaign on issues impacting all of Rhode Island and his record demonstrates that he is the type of leader we need as General Treasurer,” said Building Trades President Michael F. Sabitoni.\n\nJUNE 20: Senate Judiciary Chair Coyne not seeking reelection\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairwoman Cynthia Coyne is not seeking reelection to the Senate District 32 seat — representing all of Barrington and portions of B​ristol and East Providence — that she first won in 2014..\n\nWith the start of the candidate declaration period now only days away, Democrat Coyne — one of the highest ranked women in the R.I. Senate — issued this statement:\n\n“I have decided that the time is right to retire from the Senate, but I am not retiring from public service.\"\n\n\"In the immediate future, I look forward to spending more quality time with family and friends. I don’t know what my future may hold after that, but I know that I will always be engaged and eager to serve the community in some capacity.\"\n\nWithin hours of Coyne's announcement, Barrington Democratic Town Committee Chair Pam Lauria announced her candidacy for Coyne's seat.\n\nShe is a primary care nurse practitioner at Coastal Medical, now serving as a Trustee on Coastal’s Board. She is a volunteer and advocate with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and a member of Barrington’s Housing Board of Trustees, \"working to increase affordable housing in Barrington.\" She has led the Barrington Democratic Town Committee since 2017,\n\nShe listed, as her priorities: \"Affordable/equitable/accessible healthcare, commonsense laws to reduce gun violence, affordable housing, supporting children educationally and emotionally, and making RI affordable for all.\"\n\nCoyne is a former state trooper who retired at the rank of lieutenant in 2006, and a graduate of the FBI National Academy.,\n\nIn her first term, \"she worked to enact legislation to protect domestic violence victims by removing firearms from felony abusers... In more recent years, she championed new laws prohibiting untraceable ghost guns and 3-D printed guns.\"\n\nShe was also the lead Senate sponsor of legislation to limit firearm magazine capacity to 10 rounds of ammunition that won General Assembly approval last week after an initial tie vote in her committee that would have doomed it, has Senate leaders not vailed themselves of a rule allowing \"immediate consideration:\" of the House-passed version.\n\nThe legislation is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee this week.\n\nOn Monday, Coyne also pointed with pride to her sponsorship of legislation requiring public reporting on all child deaths or near fatalities, background checks for people working or volunteering with children and reforms to the state’s human trafficking laws.\n\nOther bills she sponsored — or co-sponsored — increased the age to purchase tobacco in Rhode Island to 21, and opened the door to compensation to individuals who were wrongfully convicted.\n\nFirst elected to the Senate in 2014, she previously served as a member of the Barrington Town Council.\n\n“The issues that come before the Judiciary Committee are some of the most emotional and divisive issues to be considered by the Senate,\" Coyne said Monday.\n\n\"I tried to find common ground and start from a place of respect to build consensus whenever we could. We were able to get a lot accomplished, and I am appreciative of everyone I have had the opportunity to work with over the years.”\n\nJUNE 17: Candidates opt in, out of contest for Democratic Party endorsements\n\nA noon deadline has now come and gone for candidates for top state and federal office to signal whether or not they want the state Democratic Party endorsement.\n\nAnd, no surprise - most do - including Gov. Dan McKee and his challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and .health care activist Luis Daniel Munoz.\n\nUnder new party rules, they not only had to declare their candidacies by noon Friday for the endorsements that will be voted on June 26, they had to name the individuals who will be nominating them and seconding their nominations.\n\nFor example, McKee is counting on North Providence Mayor Charlie Lombardi and Sen. Ana Quezada to put his name in the hat. Gorbea named Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera and party activist Ann Gooding.\n\nFoulkes named Sen. Louis DiPalma and David Chenevert, the lohg-time executive director of the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association; Brown named Portsmouth Town Councilmember Linda Ujifusa and Aaron Pearson, and Munoz named Meg Cotter and Dwayne Keys.\n\nIf none of the candidates are able to muster more than 50% of the votes in three rounds of elimination voting, there will be no endorsement as has happened on occasion in the past, but would obviously not be a good look for a sitting governor.\n\nOnly two candidates in the crowded race for the 2nd District Congressioal seat that long-time Rep. Jim Langevin is vacating opted not to seek the endorsement: Joy Fox and Omar Bah.\n\nThe other Democrats seeking the seat all threw their names in, including state Treas. Seth Magaziner, former state Rep. David Segal, Rhode Island. political newcomer Sarah Morgenthau and Providence firefighter Cameron Moquin.\n\nIn the three-way race for lieutenant, incumbent Sabina Matos is seeking the nomination. So is state Sen. Cynthia Mendes of East Providence..\n\nBut the third Democrat in the lieutenant governor's race - state Rep. Deb Ruggiero - is not.\n\nRuggiero, D-Jamestown, explained her rationale in a letter to members of the state Democratic Committee that said, in part:.\n\n\"Like you, I'm a life-long Democrat. I believe in the values of our Party; equity, equality, and justice.\"\n\n\"As Democrats, we believe in small \"d\" democracy. We have faith in our citizens and believe the more people that participate the better the process. That is my message to the voters - if you believe in me and give me your vote, I will work tirelessly for you.\"\n\n\"For this reason, I have decided NOT to seek the endorsement of the Democratic Party in my race for Lt. Governor in hopes of not dividing our Party.\"\n\nIn her own letter to the party, Matos - who was chosen by Gov. Dan McKee as his replacement when he ascended from lieutenant governor to governor in March 2021, has made this case:\n\n\"In more than a decade as a city councilor in Providence and over the past year as Lieutenant Governor, I have had the opportunity to meet and work alongside many of you.\n\n\"I know the commitment required to keeping our Democratic values and priorities front and center,\" she wrote.\n\nBoth Democrats in the race for treasurer opted to seek the nomination: Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor and former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa.\n\nThere are 250 voting members of the State Democratic Committee.(An earlier version of the blog poist said 286 based on incorrect information initially provided by the party.)\n\nThe list inlcudes, but is not limitd to: the party chairs in every city and town, three appointees each by the House Speaker and the Senate president, the state's four-member Congressional delegation, the five general officers, the party's Democratic National Committeeman and woman, and the committeeman and women in each House district, according to party advisor Kate Coyne McCoy..\n\nJUNE 15: Diossa says Pryor should resign over soccer stadium\n\nCandidate for treasurer and Central Falls Mayor James Diossa on Wednesday called on Democratic rival and state Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor to resign from negotiating a Pawtucket soccer stadium deal.\n\nPryor announced his campaign for treasurer on May 24 with a plan to step down as commerce secretary in \"two weeks\" and hit the campaign trail.\n\nBut negotiations on a bailout plan for the \"Tidewater Landing\" soccer stadium project have gotten messy. The Commerce Corporation Board of Directors on Tuesday declined to vote on a new agreement Pryor struck with developer Fortuitous Partners.\n\nThe board's concern was that the new proposal would strip public funding from the housing, infrastructure and non-stadium elements of the project, raising the possibility the state will have to spend significantly more money down the road.\n\nBut Diossa, a supporter of the stadium, blames the board's concerns about the deal on Pryor keeping them \"in the dark until such a late stage.\"\n\n\"Multiple members of the Board were visibly bothered by the lack of ready answers from Commerce staff to the Board’s basic questions,\" Diossa said in a news release. \"Transparency is critical, and the intelligent, capable members of the Commerce Board deserve access to all the information and to have their questions answered so that they can do their due diligence.\"\n\nDiossa cited comments by board member Donna Sams in particular that she was \"frustrated\" at not getting sufficient answers from Pryor.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sams took issue with Diossa attacking Pryor in her name, saying in an email that she found his answers \"satisfactory and convincing\" and that she \"would never rush Stefan's departure.\"\n\nNevertheless, Diossa went on in the Wednesday news release, accusing Pryor of using the stadium for \"political gain,\" although it was not entirely clear how Pryor is benefitting from a deal now in serious risk of collapse.\n\n\"A now declared candidate for General Treasurer, Mr. Pryor pledged to leave office within two weeks,\" Diossa wrote. \"That time having passed, Mr. Pryor has recklessly clung to power in an attempt to influence the outcome of these negotiations for future political gain.\"\n\nDiossa's partner state Sen. Sandra Cano is Pawtucket's commerce director and is part of Mayor Donald Grebien's team pushing for more state help to rescue the stadium.\n\nGrebien has endorsed Diossa for state treasurer.\n\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment on Diossa's remarks.\n\nJUNE 8: New mayoral endorsements for Cuervo and LaFortune\n\nFormer Boston Mayor Kim Janey has endorsed Providence mayoral candidate and councilwoman Nirva LaFortune.\n\n\"I know that Councilwoman LaFortune is ready to meet the challenges facing Providence. Nirva has the experience – both professional and lived experience – to hit the ground running on Day One and begin delivering results for the people of Providence,\" Janey said in a statement.\n\nJaney served as Boston's acting mayor in 2021 for eight months, becoming the city's first woman and first Black mayor after former Mayor Marty Walsh joined President Joe Biden's cabinet as secretary of labor.\n\nAnother Providence mayoral hopeful, Gonzalo Cuervo, also added an new endorsement to his list – City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris, who described Cuervo as capable of leading \"the fight for social and economic justice.\"\n\n\"Gonzalo has been a strong advocate and ally for working families in Providence for decades; as a community leader, small business owner, and within city and state government,\" Harris said. \"He has the experience, vision, and strong community ties to create greater economic opportunities for our youth, families, and neighborhoods.\"\n\nJUNE 7: Rep. Cassar joins ranks of departing state lawmakers\n\nAs the candidate declaration period approaches, a fourth member of the House of Representatives has announced that she is not seeking reelection: Barrington Democrat Liana Cassar, whose district includes a slice of Riverside in East Providence.\n\nA two-term legislator, she waged a short-lived campaign to become House speaker in the fall of 2020, when then-Speaker Nicholas Mattiello was on the ropes. She has led this year's legislative campaign to repeal the ban on state-paid insurance coverage for state workers and Medicaid recipients seeking abortions.\n\nIn an email to colleagues, Cassar wrote: “After careful deliberation, I have decided not to seek re-election. ... The demanding legislative schedule does not leave me able to fully honor my commitments to the House, along with my commitments to my career and my family.\"\n\n\"When my current term is complete at the end of this year, I will miss the daily collaboration. ... [But] be assured that I will remain a strong voice advocating for my community as well as for justice and equity in Rhode Island.”\n\nThree other House Democrats are leaving: Rep. Gregg Amore of East Providence, to run for secretary of state; Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, to run for lieutenant governor; and freshman Steven Lima of Woonsocket, who has endorsed former Rep. Jon Brien, a Democrat-turned-independent, to replace him.\n\nBrien last served in the House in 2012. He had four years on the Woonsocket City Council more recently. Another former Woonsocket councilman, Alex Kithes, running under the Rhode Island Political Cooperative banner, has also announced for Lima's seat.\n\nOn the Senate side, there are three announced departures so far, including Senate Republican leader Dennis Algiere of Westerly. More are expected.\n\nTwo Democrats candidates so far have announced for the seat that Algiere has held for close to three decades: Victoria Gu and Michael Niemeyer.\n\nForced by redistricting into a potential fight to keep her Senate seat in a district straddling Warwick and Cranston, first-term Sen. Kendra Anderson also chose to bow out. She endorsed Harrison Tuttle, head of the Black Lives Matter Rhode Island Political Action Committee,as her replacement.\n\nAt least one other candidate, former state prosecutor Matt LaMountain, has announced for the seat.\n\nFreshman Sen. Cynthia Mendes, D-East Providence, has opted to run for lieutenant governor. At least two Democrats have expressed an interest in running for the seat: Jeff Britto and Greg Greco.\n\nCandidates have three days, June 27 to 29, to file their official paperwork to run for election to a state or local seat. The primary is Sept. 13 and the general election is Nov. 8. in the September 13 primary and the November 8 general election.\n\nJUNE 3: Raimondo joins former colleague Smiley for campaign event\n\nFormer Gov. Gina Raimondo is set to join mayoral candidate Brett Smiley on Friday, her support marking the highest-level endorsement in the race so far.\n\nRaimondo, who now serves as President Joe Biden's secretary of commerce, is scheduled to appear with Smiley at Farm Fresh Rhode Island, a local nonprofit that organizes farmers markets, among other activities.\n\nSmiley, who served as a top aide to Raimondo during her time as governor, will discuss the her administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an event description.\n\n\"Together, with our colleagues in government, we opened Rhode Island schools during a global pandemic, established statewide testing facilities and built field hospitals,\" a campaign email stated, adding that the duo will \"talk about both what we accomplished and how I will bring those lessons with me as Providence’s next mayor.\"\n\nRaimondo's trip comes not long after Raimondo visited Brown University in March to give a lecture on international affairs.\n\nMAY 31: Ex-mayoral candidate Michael Solomon endorses Brett Smiley\n\nMichael Solomon, who dropped out of Providence's mayoral race earlier this month, endorsed candidate Brett Smiley on Tuesday. He is part of a lengthy list of endorsements the former top aide to Gov. Gina Raimondo has received, several of them from the City Council. That includes Council President John Igliozzi, Councilwoman Jo-Ann Ryan and Councilmen Nicholas Narducci, Michael Correia and Jim Taylor.\n\nCandidate Gonzalo Cuervo has also amassed a list of endorsements from his former boss, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera, former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, Providence Councilwoman Rachel Miller and others. Former and current state lawmakers have also endorsed Smiley and Cuervo.\n\nCouncilwoman Nirva LaFortune has endorsements for from Reps. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell and Rebecca Kislak, and Dr. Joanna Brown, who teaches family medicine at Brown University.\n\nMAY 25: Democratic committee chairs endorse challengers over incumbents\n\nA majority of the chairs of 31 Democratic city and town committees have endorsed challengers over Gov. Dan McKee and his appointed lieutenant governor, Sabina Matos.\n\nVoting on Tuesday night, the Association of City and Town Democratic Chairs endorsed term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea for governor, over McKee, and Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, over Matos, according to Pam Lauria, the chair of the Barrington Democratic Town Committee and vice president of the chairs' association.\n\nThe group also endorsed Stefan Pryor for state treasurer over former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, only hours after Pryor announced his candidacy, and Rep. Gregg Amore for secretary of state.\n\nThe votes represent a slice of the potential Democratic primary vote in September, but it is unclear how representative they are.\n\nIt has not been disclosed, for example, which cities and towns were represented in the vote, and which were not though Lauria, when asked, said she did not believe the chair of the Providence Democrats participated in the vote.\n\nIt is also unclear how many of the city and town committees have conducted their own votes, and the extent to which their votes matched those of their chairs.\n\nFor example, the Democrats on the Barrington committee endorsed Matos over Ruggiero, according to a list provided by Lauria. She said she was only aware of two that have voted so far, including her own.\n\nAccording to one account: Gorbea captured 17 of the 31 chairs voting, McKee 12 while two votes went elsewhere.\n\nAsked what he made of the endorsement by the association of chairs, McKee on Wednesday said: \"I don't make much of it.\"\n\nHe said the communities that were \"supporting us there...[are those] with populations that are very large,\" and \"communities with the largest populations in the state of Rhode Island are very supportive of me.\"\n\nMAY 16: Foulkes hits the air with first TV ad\n\nThe election-year air war is about to heat up with Democratic candidate for governor Helena Buonanno Foulkes -- sitting on the largest campaign bank balance of anyone in the race -- set to run her first television commercial.\n\nThe one-minute ad called \"Big Things\" focuses on the former CVS executive's biography and briefly touches on her main policy plans.\n\n\"I'm Helena Foulkes. Let's get big things done for Rhode Island,\" she says at the end of the ad as the camera pans from downtown Providence to the State House.\n\nCampaign watchers have been wondering when Foulkes would start advertising because of her sizable campaign war chest, but relatively low political profile, having never run for elected office before.\n\nAt the end of March, Foulkes reported $1.5 million in her campaign account.\n\nShe has hired veteran ad producer Tad Devine.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus, who is also new to politics, was the first gubernatorial candidate to hit the airwaves when she began advertising last month.\n\nMAY 12: Gorbea wins first union endorsement, while Foulkes doubles down on abortion funding\n\nWhile Helena Foulkes nudged Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday to take more aggressive action on abortion funding, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea - announced her first union endorsement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Ashley Kalus - the only candidate in the governor's race with TV ads so far - aired a new commercial stating her goals, without a lot of specifics on how she would get there. Among her goals: \"creating a world class education system.\"\n\nOn the endorsement front: \"Nellie Gorbea has and will continue to be a friend of workers and our union,\" said Derek Dunne with the United Steelworkers Local 12431 out of District 4 in a statement made public by the Gorbea campaign.\n\nThe union mentioned Democrat Gorbea's focus on \"creating good paying jobs through significant investment in sustainable housing and growing the blue economy.\"\n\nWith earlier endorsements from EMILY's List and the Latino Victory Fund, Gorbea has a ways to catch up with McKee.\n\nOn March 10, the McKee campaign announced endorsements from a coalition of construction unions and the powerful Laborers' International Union.\n\nThat included an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council representing 17 unions and the Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council.\n\nOn abortion, there is no major policy difference between Foulkes, a former CVS executive, and McKee.\n\nBut Foulkes on Thursday called on McKee to \"immediately submit a revised budget to the General Assembly that eliminates bans on abortion coverage\" for state workers and Medicaid recipients. .\n\n\"Abortion is healthcare and must be accessible for all, regardless of how much money you make or how you get health insurance,\" said Foulkes, accusing McKee of failing - in his then role as lieutenant governor - \"to lead in support'' of the 2019 law enshrining abortion rights in state law.\n\nThe McKee campaign declined comment. But soon after the potential repeal by the U.S. Supreme Court of the landmark Roe V. Wade abortion rights decision went public, McKee announced his \"full support\" for a pending bill to remove the restrictions on state-paid insurance coverage for abortions.\n\n\"He urges the General Assembly to pass this bill and send it to his desk for signature,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nMAY 9: The race heats up between Gorbea and Foulkes with exchange of digs\n\nWithout once mentioning the name of former CVS executive Helena Foulkes, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea tried Monday to link her fellow contender for governor to the potentially imminent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the landmark abortion-rights decision Roe v. Wade.\n\nGorbea fired off a fundraising email centered on Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's role in shaping the current makeup of the court.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, she said: \"Reminder that Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat which helped make [this] horrifying news possible. Which is just one in a very long list of reasons why donating to Mitch McConnell is never okay and inexcusable for someone who wants to be governor of RI.\"\n\nElaborating in a fundraising email that went out Monday, the Gorbea campaign said: \"McConnell has always been anti-choice and has spent decades reshaping our courts to ban abortion.\n\n\"That’s why it’s so shocking that Nellie’s wealthiest opponent personally contributed to his re-election campaign. ... This isn’t behavior we should accept from our next Democratic Governor of Rhode Island — and that’s why we need your support to win this race.\"\n\nFoulkes has acknowledged and publicly stated her regret for donating $500 to McConnell in 2014, about six months before Republicans took control of the Senate in midterm elections and McConnell became majority leader. She was head of CVS Health's pharmacy empire at the time.\n\nThe response from Foulkes spokeswoman Audrey Lucas to Gorbea: \"It is extremely disappointing that at a moment when reproductive rights are literally being taken away from women across the country, Secretary Gorbea would choose to attack a strongly pro-choice candidate.\n\n\"Sadly, this is typical for career politicians who spend their time launching attacks on their opponents rather than getting things done for Rhode Islanders.\n\n\"It’s also an interesting line of criticism coming from the Secretary, who started her career working for a Republican governor, refused to endorse Rhode Island’s first woman governor in her re-election, and knocked doors to help elect the pro-life Speaker of the House who prevented Rhode Island from codifying Roe v. Wade into state law for years.\"\n\nThe response alluded to an online photo of Gorbea knocking on doors on the campaign trail with then-House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello.\n\nIn response to earlier questions about the McConnell contribution, Foulkes said:\n\n\"Over the years I've made campaign contributions – mostly to Democrats, but to some Republicans, too – because, like most Rhode Islanders, I wanted a government where people from both parties could work together and get things done.\n\n\"One of the last Republicans I contributed to many years ago was Mitch McConnell and it's something I deeply regret and would never do again,\" she continued. \"It was before he colluded with Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court and more. I sincerely apologize.\"\n\nAPRIL 29: Gorbea says she leads the RI governor's race, according her pollster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea says a poll conducted by her campaign shows she is the frontrunner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\nLake Research Partners, Gorbea's polling firm, released a polling memo Friday saying Gorbea had the support of 30% of the voters surveyed in a poll conducted earlier this month, compared to 24% for Gov. Dan McKee, 10% for former Secretary of State Matt Brown, 7% for former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes and 1% for Luis-Daniel Muñoz.\n\nTwenty-six percent of voters polled were undecided, the memo said. The full poll was not\n\nThe poll was conducted April 11 to 14 on both cell phones and landlines of 600 likely Democratic primary voters, the Lake polling memo said.\n\nLake Research Partners is the polling firm of longtime Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\n\nWhen Lake last polled the field, McKee led the field with 26% of the vote, the memo said.\n\nGorbea's poll said 55% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Gorbea compared with 48% for McKee, according to the memo.\n\nAPRIL 28: McKee's approval rate drops to 42% in new poll\n\nGov. Dan McKee's popularity has fallen dramatically since last year, according to a new online poll released Thursday that said 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing and 40% disapprove.\n\nLast fall, 60% of surveyed voters approved of the job McKee was doing and only 25% disapproved, according to Morning Consult. The 48th\n\nThe 18 percentage point drop in McKee's approval rating was the largest of any governor, Morning Consult said. And only two governors, Kate Brown of Oregon and David Ige of Hawaii, posted lower approval ratings.\n\nMassachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker retained the highest approval rating in the nation -- 74% -- in the survey, which was conducted from Jan. 1 to March 31 and included \"at least 601 registered voters in each state.\" Baker's disapproval rating was 21%.\n\nConnecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont posted the 18th highest approval rating at 57%, with 35% disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nAPRIL 21: Segal lands Elizabeth Warren endorsement\n\nA day after he officially launched his campaign for Congress, former State Rep. Segal picked up the endorsement of Massachusetts U.S. Sen. recent presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"I’ve worked with @DavidSegalRI on plans to level the economic playing field, support a responsible foreign policy, and build a government that Americans can trust to work for them,\" Warren tweeted Thursday morning. \"I’m happy to endorse him for Congress in #RI02 because he’s ready to make change happen.\"\n\nSegal, who co-founded the progressive advocacy group Demand Progress after leaving the General Assembly in 2011, is running on the left of what is now a five-person Democratic primary field to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in the second congressional district.\n\nAPRIL 20: GOP candidate for RI governor, Ashley Kalus airing first TV ads of campaign season\n\nPROVIDENCE — Ashley Kalus, the Republican candidate for governor, has purchased roughly $109,000 of airtime in Rhode Island for the first TV ads of the '22 campaign season and separately, gone on the attack against R.I.'s political establishment.\n\nThe ad buy - scheduled to run Wednesday through April 26 - was first reported by the local CBS affiliate, WPRI, and confirmed by Kalus' Ohio-based media buying firm, Medium Buying. It is scheduled to run on \"broadcast, cable, radio and regional sports\" networks, according to the firm.\n\nThe 60-second TV ad echoes the video clip Kalus, a relative newcomer to Rhode Island, released to introduce herself to her new home state when she announced for governor, including her declaration that the days of \"I know a guy\" are over.\n\nShe sent a link to the ad to members of the Republican State Central Committee on Tuesday night, along with an email that said, in part: \"Big News!\"\n\n\"I wanted you to be the first to know that we are taking our campaign across all media fronts tomorrow. Since we launched last month, we have campaigned through almost every city and town across Rhode Island.\n\n\"We are going to campaign just as hard in Providence and Pawtucket as we are in Warwick and Cranston. For too long, Democrats have taken the Black and Hispanic vote for granted and I plan on fighting for everyone’s vote.\"\n\nFrom there she launched into an attack on the \"career politicians and insiders [who] have taken advantage of the taxpayers.\"\n\n\"Rhode Islanders foot the bill so insiders can line their own pockets,'' she wrote. \"Just the latest examples are the failed merger of Lifespan and Care New England, handing out $3,000 bonuses to politically appointed judges, and now the proposed corporate welfare for the Superman Building.\"\n\n\"I'm going to the Statehouse to shake things up!\" she said, in her email, not the ad.\n\nFor the record, the $3,000 bonuses for judges were awarded by the Chief Justice of the R.I. Supreme Court, not Gov. Dan McKee, the Democrat she hopes to replace. But the award came to light after McKee awarded like-sized \"retention bonuses to unionized employees across state government.\n\nAPRIL 18: Gorbea releases 10 years of tax filings, asks competitors in race for governor to do same\n\nPROVIDENCE — Rhode Island's term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea on Monday made 10 years of her tax filings public, and called on her opponents in the race for governor to do the same.\n\nThere has been no direct response to that late-day challenge from incumbent Gov. Dan McKee, who was headed out-of-state to a Democratic governor's conference on Monday, or the other candidates in the race.\n\nWith two exceptions, all of Gorbea's competitors have released their own tax returns annually, to one degree or another, but none going back 10 years.\n\nThe two exceptions: dark horse Democratic candidate Luis-Daniel Munoz, who declined to do so in the past, and Republican candidate Ashley Kalus who has not yet responded to Journal inquiries on Monday on her willingness to make her tax filings public.\n\nAs a starting point, Gorbea made public the top pages of her filings as she has done before during her years in state office - but did so for a ten-year period that extends back to a point before she held elected office.\n\nMost recently, she and her husband, Steven L. DHondt paid $60,127 in federal taxes and $16,818 in state taxes to Rhode Island on their adjusted gross income of $325,666.\n\nHer campaign said copies of her full return would be made available to the media upon request.\n\nExplaining her own decision to release 10 years of tax filings, Gorbea said: \"Rhode Islanders deserve nothing less than full transparency from their elected officials—especially from anyone who is seeking to lead the state.\n\n\"This shouldn’t be complicated,” she said.\n\n“As gubernatorial candidates, we are asking Rhode Islanders for their trust to run our state. They deserve to know how much we are paid, any potential conflicts of interest, and then how much we paid in state and federal taxes.\n\n\"Too many voters are cynical and disillusioned,\" she said. \"It’s not healthy for our politics locally or our democracy as a whole. I’m committed to transparency and accountability.\"\n\nAPRIL 15: Lt. Gov. Matos touts endorsements- 'an American success story'\n\nPROVIDENCE — A day after her official campaign launch, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos is touting a swath of endorsements from the labor and political world, including Armand Sabitoni, the general-secretary- treasurer of the Laborers International Union of North America.\n\nOne of her two Democratic primary opponents - Rep. Deborah Ruggiero - has captured the endorsement of many of her House colleagues, including the speaker who has an outsized voice over the state Democratic Party endorsement...\n\nBut Matos - who highlights her status as \"the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Rhode Island\" - on Friday announced endorsements from the governor and nine state lawmakers - including Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin and Rep. Grace Diaz, the vice-chair of the state Democratic Party,\n\nOthers on the list of people endorsing Matos - who was the president of the Providence City Council until Gov. Dan McKee appointed her lieutenant governor a year ago - include the mayors of East Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence and Newport and former Providence Mayor Angel Tavares.\n\n\"Like many of our members, Sabina Matos is an American success story,\" said Michael Sabitoni, chairman of the Rhode Island Council of Building Trades.\n\nRecalling her history as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic 28 years ago who became the president of the Providence City Council before her appointment to lieutenant governor, Sabitoni said:\n\n“While on the council, she championed the passage of numerous ordinances promoting economic development for Providence residents and their families... She shattered a glass ceiling long overdue for smashing, and uses her office every day to advocate for all Rhode Islanders.\" (Michael and Armand Sabitoni are cousins.)\n\nOther union leaders on the list are affiliated with SEIU Local 580 and the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.\n\nMatos also picked up an endorsement from former state Democratic Party chairman Bill Lynch.\n\nMatos is seeking election for the first time to the job to which she was appointed by McKee after he ascended from lieutenant governor on March 2, 2021 on the heels of Gina Raimondo's resignation to take a Biden cabinet post.\n\nShe is competing with Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nCandidate Michael Neary issued a statement Thursday from Columbus, Ohio, confirming his intent to stay in the race for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat despite his recent arrest on charges of drug possession and \"menacing\" an Ohio couple on an interstate.\n\n\"I am currently seeking medical and mental health treatment and have been referred to a neurologist for a possible non-Epileptic seizure-related condition,'' Neary said in his statement, affirming his plans to remain in the Congressional race \"all the way to the September primary.\"\n\n\"I know there are many questions surrounding recent news reports, and a full statement will be forthcoming in the coming days,\" he said. .\n\nThe Ohio couple told authorities they were \"scared for their life\" after a bizarre run-in with Neary on the road the morning of March 23, according to an arrest report released by the Miami County Sheriff's Office.\n\nNeary pleaded not guilty to the charges, was released on $2,500 bond and ordered to appear in court for a pretrial conference on April 21, according to court records.\n\nAsked Thursday to clarify his situation, Neary said: \"I changed my voter registration some time ago and have been staying with my parents in Coventry while trying to find a permanent living situation in town.\"\n\nBut, \"I am currently in Columbus where ... I am actively seeking medical treatment. ... That is where I am right now and what I am currently doing before I can return home to Rhode Island permanently.\"\n\nThe Ohio couple described being followed by a vehicle that sped up, slowed down and exited the highway when they did, more than once.\n\nWhen the authorities caught up with him, \"Mr. Neary appeared to be nervous, his eyes were bloodshot and he was talking fast,\" the report said.\n\nNeary initially told deputies that he had known the driver of the car that he was following, but then changed his story and said that he was \"drawn to the Ohio registration on that vehicle,\" according to the police report.\n\nNeary reportedly told police that he \"recently has been stressed and went out for a drive to clear his head,\" that he had been staying with his parents in Rhode Island and had a big argument with them before he left.\n\nNeary allowed police to search his 2017 Hyundai Elantra, which is registered to a Columbus address. According to the report, police found a half-empty bottle of whisky, a clear plastic container containing baggies of marijuana, a ceramic pipe and a grinder.\n\nBefore his arrest, Neary told The Providence Journal that he was a sixth-generation Rhode Islander who had grown up in Coventry but had recently been living in Ohio.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Neary said this is the first time he has ever been arrested,, \"so I am also focused on addressing the Misdemeanor charges here in Ohio.\" In the interim, he said: \"steps have been taken to retain legal counsel.\"\n\n\"While these have been a difficult few weeks for our family as we deal with various private matters together, the stories we have heard from Rhode Islanders about the problems they are facing in their everyday lives over the last several months is my only motivation to continue this campaign.\"\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nFoulkes reports raising $1.3 million in first quarter\n\nFormer CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes' campaign said Thursday she raised $1.3 million in the first three months of the year, the largest quarterly fundraising total claimed by any of the candidates for governor so far.\n\nFoulkes' first-quarter fundraising includes $900,000 in donations and a $400,000 personal loan to her campaign, spokeswoman Audrey Lucas said. She said \"nearly half\" of the contributions came from new donors.\n\nThe $1.3-million tally should give Foulkes the financial edge in the battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, she raised $973,000 from donors and put $100,000 of her own money into the race, which at the time was the largest fundraising quarter of the race.\n\nGov. Dan McKee's campaign said he raised over $400,000 in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former secretary of state Matt Brown have not shared any details of their first-quarter fundraising yet.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ashley Kalus two weeks ago announced that she had loaned her campaign $500,000 of her own money.\n\nRhode Island candidates have until the end of the month to file their official campaign finance reports.\n\nThose reports will include how much each of the candidates have spent as well as a breakdown of their donors.\n\n“Every day our campaign gets stronger as Helena meets Rhode Islanders all across the state and shares her positive vision to transform our public schools, make it more affordable to live in Rhode Island and create great jobs for all,” Lucas said in a news release. “We are so grateful for the support we’ve received, which will allow us to get our message out to voters and position us to win this race.”\n\nAPRIL 8:\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos assembles election campaign team\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos will make it official on Thursday that she is running for election to the job to which she was appointed by Gov. Dan McKee last spring after his own blink-of-the eye ascension to governor..\n\nIn a news release that went out Friday afternoon, Matos – the first Afro-Latina to hold statewide office in Rhode Island – also named the key members of her campaign team. They include many familiar names.\n\n\"When I came to Rhode Island as a 20-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, I never thought I would run for public office, much less serve as Lieutenant Governor,\" she said, according to the news release.\n\n\"But in America, anything is possible. Now I’m working to fix systemic injustices and make sure everyone has the same opportunities I did. I understand the challenges facing Rhode Islanders because they’re mine as well. I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because Rhode Islanders deserve a champion that puts them first.”\n\nHer campaign hires include:\n\n*Kristina Contreras Fox as campaign manager. Contreras Fox most recently led policy and advocacy efforts for the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, and before that was field director for Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza's campaign. .\n\n*Mike Raia of Half Street Strategic Consulting, as senior advisor for communications. Raia did a turn as Gov. Gina Raimondo's communications director and also served as a senior advisor to Raimondo’s 2018 reelection campaign.\n\n*Pete Brodnitz of Expedition Strategies as the campaign’s research consultant. Brodnitz did polling for Raimondo, consulted on both of her winning campaigns for governor and led the research operation for Attorney General Peter Neronha’s campaign in 2018.\n\n*Tierney Hunt and Matt Burgess of The New Media Firm as the leads on Matos's television, digital and radio advertising efforts. Hunt and Burgess have worked on a number of notable Democratic and progressive campaigns, including efforts for EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Votes.\n\nDemocrat Matos, the former president of the Providence City Council, was appointed by McKee to replace himself as lieutenant governor when Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post, and he was automatically elevated to governor.\n\nMatos faces two Democratic challengers so far, state Rep. Deb Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes.\n\nAPRIL 6:\n\nHouse speaker endorses Rep. Ruggiero's campaign for lieutenant governor\n\nIf Gov. Dan McKee was hoping state Democratic Party leaders would endorse his hand-picked lieutenant governor, the chances dimmed Wednesday when House Speaker Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi endorsed a House colleague instead.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Deb Ruggiero's campaign announced that she had picked up the endorsements of Shekarchi and 35 other Democratic office-holders and activists, including the House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski and Majority Whip Katherine Kazarian, and 10 other House colleagues.\n\nWhoever is House speaker traditionally has an outsized voice in who gets the state Democratic Committee endorsement, because the majority of the members are appointed by House District Committees, whose members are themselves appointed by state representatives who, in turn, have elected the speaker as their leader.\n\nIn this case, Shekarchi endorsed Ruggiero over the incumbent, Sabina Matos, who was appointed by McKee to take his place after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo resigned for a post in the Biden Cabinet last year. State Sen. Cynthia Mendes is also running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday morning, Ruggiero told The Journal she does not intend to seek the state Democratic Party's endorsement. \"I am going to stay in my lane, run my race, stay focused and positive ... and do the work I need to do.\n\n\"I don't want this to be divisive,\" she said.\n\nOne potential outcome – seen before – is that the state party opts for neutrality in a race that pits that governor's choice against the speaker's.\n\nIn a statement accompanying Wednesday's announcement, Shekarchi said he was \"proudly\" endorsing Ruggiero, with whom he has worked since he was first elected 10 years ago.\n\n\"She is an extremely dedicated, hard-working and honest public servant. As a long-time member of the House Finance Committee, Deb has a great understanding of state government and she is highly qualified to hit the ground running from Day One,\" he said.\n\nRuggiero has represented House District 74, encompassing Jamestown and Middletown, for the past 14 years and currently chairs the House Committee on Innovation, Internet, and Technology and has a seat on the House Finance Committee.\n\nIn other campaign news, Democrat McKee picked up the endorsement of two other private-sector unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Locals 99 and 2323, which together say they represent about 2,850 current and retired electrical and telecom workers.\n\nMcKee \"has been a strong ally for our members and all people who work with their hands for a living. Coming into office during one of the most challenging moments in our state’s history, [he] rolled up his sleeves and focused on keeping our economy open and getting people back to work,\" said Joe Walsh Jr., IBEW Local 99 business manager.\n\n“Governor McKee has been put to the test in his first year in office – leading our state through a difficult public health and economic crisis – and has earned re-election,\" echoed Christopher Buffery, IBEW Local 2323 business manager.\n\nThe two locals join the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, the Laborers’ District Council, and seven mayors and town administrators in endorsing McKee's election bid.\n\nAPRIL 4:\n\nCongressional candidates tout big Q1 fundraising totals\n\nSarah Morgenthau's and Allan Fung's congressional campaigns said Monday they've raised more than $500,000 in the first three months of the year, while Seth Magaziner said he's pulled in $1.4 million over that period.\n\nOn Tuesday Democrat Joy Fox, a former staffer to U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin and Gina Raimondo, said she had raised \"more than $175,000 from 406 contributions since launching in February.\"\n\nFormer state Rep. David Segal, who is officially still exploring getting in the second district Democratic primary, said he raised $252,000 since late February.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Republican state Sen. Jessica de la Cruz said she raised $85,000 since launching her campaign last month.\n\nIn a news release, she said 96% of her 250 donors were from Rhode Island.\n\nCandidates are not required to file their official first-quarter fundraising reports, which include the source of donations and any personal loans, until later in the month.\n\n\"In just five weeks time, we have accumulated an excess of $500,00", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterm-election-live-updates/8257821001/", "title": "Election 2022 recap: Fetterman flips Pennsylvania Senate seat for ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Election Day 2022.

Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a harsh Trump critic, Barrett was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence. Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep.

Tony Evers won a heated re-election battle against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll last week had them tied at 48%.\n\nEvers won the governor’s office by a thin margin in 2018 when he defeated Republican Scott Walker, a 2016 presidential candidate. Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates: Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fetterman and Oz have been vying for the open seat created by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement.\n\n\"It's official. I will be the next U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTexas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez reelected to House\n\nRep.

But Gonzalez’ win is a blow to those efforts.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nNo victory or concession speeches tonight from Nevada Democrats\n\nJust as the crowd doubled in size at the Democratic ticket's election party on the Las Vegas Strip, Nevada's top candidates took the stage to thank their supporters – and encourage them to \"go home.\"\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Gov. Steve Sisolak said they didn't expect final election results to be available before the end of the night, but assured the crowd that they \"believe strongly when this is done, we're going to win this thing!\"\n\n\"It's going to be a couple of days,\" Sisolak said, \"so I encourage you to go home, get some sleep, and let the county continue (counting) tomorrow and Thursday.

Henry Cuellar reelected in Texas\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar won reelection Tuesday, fending off an aggressive play by Republicans to remake the U.S.-Mexico border into a midterm battleground.\n\nCuellar’s victory over Republican Cassy Garcia holds the line for Democrats in an important stronghold for the party. Garcia was one of three Republican Latina candidates who ran competitive House races along the border after the GOP made inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020.\n\nCuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House and narrowly survived a primary challenge this spring from a progressive challenger.\n\n– Paul J.

She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race. She initially hoped to run on the Republican ticket, and is among those that have questioned the validity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Laura Bargfeld, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrats win in Hawaii Senate, governor’s races\n\nDemocrats easily won their races for the U.S. Senate and governorship in Hawaii.\n\nJosh Green overcame Republican challenger Duke Aiona for governor, while Sen.

Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nIt’s also a bellwether for which way national tides are turning on Election Day. The Senate seat has been occupied since 2011 by Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who’s retiring.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Patty Murray wins reelection to Senate\n\nDemocratic Washington Sen. Patty Murray won reelection to the Senate against Republican opponent Tiffany Smiley after leading Smiley by nearly 15% with 56% of the precincts reporting, according to multiple reports.\n\nMurray will be serving her sixth term in the Senate.

Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria unseated by Jennifer Kiggans\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans unseated incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., Tuesday in Virginia's 2nd District, which gained a more Republican tilt in redistricting but was still considered a toss-up.\n\nBoth Luria and Kiggans are Navy veterans who campaigned on promises to fight for defense and veterans issues.\n\nKiggans, who currently represents Legislative District 7 in the Tidewater region of the state, positioned herself as the candidate to restore American strength that she said has been injured by the policies of the Biden administration - policies she said Luria continually backed.\n\nLuria, a two-term House member, is also a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. A main thrust of her campaign was what she called Kiggans' failure to discuss her stance on results of the 2020 election.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nDoes early good news for Dems mean a red tsunami isn't materializing?\n\nTwo vulnerable House Democrats in Virginia swing districts appeared to be on their way to victories, perhaps signaling that a red tsunami many predicted isn’t materializing.\n\nCNN and NBC projected that U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Yesli Vega in the state’s 7th congressional district, a fiercely fought battleground, while Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., was the projected winner over Republican Hung Cha in the 10th congressional district.\n\n“I’m still waiting for the Red Wave to arrive,” veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberger said on Twitter. “It may still come, but I have not seen it yet. That does not mean the Rs won’t win the House and Senate.”\n\nRepublicans picked up a third battleground seat in Virginia, however, with CNN projecting Jen Kiggans defeated Rep.

But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959.

Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., beat back Trump-endorsed Republican challenger Don Bolduc in a race that narrowed sharply in the final days despite the state being carried by President Joe Biden in 2020, according to ABC and NBC News\n\nHassan, who served as governor from 2013 until she entered the Senate in 2017, tried to distance herself from the president throughout her campaign. She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September. In October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stopped funding Bolduc’s campaign to prioritize other battleground states.\n\n– Ryan Knappenberger\n\nProgressive activist becomes first Gen Z-er to be elected to Congress\n\nA former March for Our Lives and ACLU activist, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, 25, won his election bid against Republican Army veteran Calvin Wimbish to represent Florida's 10th Congressional District, which includes the Orlando area.

Greg Abbott won reelection, besting former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who had sought to ride what he and other Democrats hoped would be a wave of registered Democratic voters to victory in the long deep-red state, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe race drew national attention for O'Rourke, who lost a bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and made a brief presidential run in 2020. O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.

King also took into consideration his daughter, who has autism. “I support any candidate who decides that they want to help out our special needs community because they’re marginalized,” he said.\n\n– Kaila Nichols and Dante Nieto, Medill News Service\n\nIn Texas, Beto O'Rourke supporters argue with protesters over LGBTQ issues\n\nDemocrat Beto O’Rourke, who is challenging Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, held an Election Day meet-and-greet outside a public library in North Dallas this morning. While O’Rourke talked with a ring of supporters, far-right agitators jostled with onlookers and tried to disrupt the candidate’s speech, with little success.\n\nThe handful of anti-O’Rourke onlookers shouted statements about pedophilia and transgender rights that have become a refrain of the extremist right in Texas in recent months. Despite some high-spirited discussions with the candidate’s supporters, the hecklers were unable to push past them and get close to O’Rourke, who spoke to the crowd for about an hour.\n\nTransgender rights have become a political lightning rod in Texas, which has also seen a surge in protests and attacks on LGBTQ-friendly events such as family friendly drag shows. O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L. Hughley Show” when asked about his message to Black Americans who are still on the fence about voting.\n\nMAGA Republicans are “a different breed of cat,” Biden said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday morning. “They care about your community about as much as … well, anyway,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “You’ve seen what you’ve got from that community,” he added.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race: Ted Budd supporters optimistic at polls\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – North Carolina has never elected a woman of color to the U.S. Senate, and many voters don't expect that to change Tuesday.\n\nSupporters of Democrat Cheri Beasley say they are not exactly confident, but some remain hopeful: \"Some of the underdogs come out on top!\" said Jannet Blue, 58, a Department of Motor Vehicles supervisor who voted in Winston-Salem.\n\nBackers of Republican Ted Budd are more confident; his poll lead has grown in recent weeks, and voters said it just feels like a Republican year in the Tar Heel State. \"We need to keep working people working,\" said James Wilcox, 61, a Winston-Salem businessman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nArizona voting machines: Maricopa County resolves ballot tabulation issues at some locations\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department found a solution for tabulation issues that affected about 60 of the county’s 223 voting centers, the county government said Tuesday.\n\nPrinters at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on ballots, according to Maricopa County’s official Twitter. To resolve the issue, county technicians changed the printer settings. The solution has so far worked at 17 locations and technicians have been deployed to the remaining locations to resolve the issue, according to the county.\n\nStephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, issued an apology to voters on his personal Twitter, promising that “every legal vote will be tabulated.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nPhiladelphia voting ‘going great’ so far\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tuesday has been a “wonderful” day for voting in the city, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\n“It’s going great,” he told USA TODAY. “Nothing has risen to a level of concern.”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of voters have been able to cast ballots without incident and the processing has been “going smoothly,” Custodio said.\n\nPolls are open until 8 p.m. and voters can turn in mailed ballots until that time in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFor some in New Hampshire, Biden’s stake in democracy gets through\n\nBEDFORD, N.H. – For some in New Hampshire, where presidential candidates flock every four years, President Joe Biden’s message that democracy is at stake resonated with some voters.\n\nJonathan French says it’s why he’s voting for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power. It won’t help me afford groceries,” she said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMan in custody after disturbance at West Bend, Wisconsin, polling place\n\nA 38-year-old Wisconsin man was arrested Tuesday after “demanding for staff to ‘stop the voting'\" not far from a polling location in the West Bend Community Memorial Library in West Bend, Wisconsin, according to police.\n\nA poll worker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he heard a man with a knife approach the library’s front desk. Voters and children playing in the area were escorted into the voting room, he said, and the doors were shut.\n\nLibrary staff declined to comment on the incident. Police would not confirm whether a knife was involved, saying only that someone was taken into custody following a disturbance in which no one was injured. Voting at the library was disrupted for about 30 minutes, the poll worker said, but has since returned to normal operations.\n\n– Lawrence Andrea\n\nGet your 2022 live midterm election results here\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are underway and American voters are hitting the polls to elect members of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as governors in certain states.\n\nFollow our live coverage for Senate results, House results and gubernatorial results begin to roll in. You can also learn how to vote and who's on the ballot in your state.\n\nCybersecurity officials: Still no specific or credible threat to disrupt election operations\n\nTwo senior U.S. cybersecurity officials said Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Homeland Security continues to see no specific or credible threat to disrupt election infrastructure or election day operations, and that it remains vigilant to protect against foreign nation disinformation and malign influence operations.\n\nThe officials, both with DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA, noted that there have been a few isolated issues arising from within the 8,800 or so individual election jurisdictions in the United States, including Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\nBut they described them as nothing out of the ordinary and said CISA was in close touch with elected officials there and elsewhere across the country in order to understand and respond to any election day problems if needed.The officials, both speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing cybersecurity operations, referred questions about Maricopa County to local officials there, who have released statements and a video explaining how the voting machinery works.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nVoting rights group: Overvoting in NH causes some concerns\n\nDERRY, N.H. – In New Hampshire, some voters are filling out more names than they should on their ballot, forcing their ballot to be hand recounted rather than being read by a machine. Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife. Most recently, allegations surfaced that he pressured former girlfriends to have abortions, which he has denied.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMark Kelly, Blake Masters set for final pitch in Arizona Senate race\n\nOn one side is Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 1.5% as of 1 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also up by more than 1%.\n\nStocks tend to perform better when in a divided Congress gridlock since it can restrict government spending and hold up new legislation that can negatively impact stocks, analysts said.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald and Medora Lee\n\nMore debates is what some voters wanted\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. — Coming out of his polling place in DeKalb County, voter Gregory Ewing said what was most aggravating during the 2022 midterms was the lack of debates.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported in September many candidates sought to avoid each other in some of the most high-profile races.\n\nEwing said Georgians deserved more chances to see a direct contrast between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker on stage in the final weeks of the race.\n\n“It’s hard to know what the truth is with these ads. The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov. Greg Abbott faces Beto O’Rourke\n\nTexans have their eye on the marquee race for governor: incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott runs against Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke caught the attention of the state and nation after running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. Abbott is fighting for a third term.\n\nAbbott has led ahead of O’Rourke in Texas polls; margins sometimes reach single digits. On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation. O’Rourke’s final ad ahead of Election Day centered around his support for abortion access.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\nBiden spending Election Day at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is spending Election Day at the White House with no public events on his schedule.\n\nThe White House said he dropped in on a virtual phone bank by the Democratic National Committee to thank staff and volunteers and taped a radio interview targeted at Black Americans.\n\nThe president has already cast his midterm ballot. Accompanied by one of his granddaughters, a first-time voter, Biden voted in Wilmington, Delaware, on Oct. 29.\n\nBiden is expected to address the nation about the election results on Wednesday, though they are likely to be incomplete at that point.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump says he voted for DeSantis, hints again at presidential run\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he voted Tuesday morning for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, while also dropping more hints that he’ll soon declare a third run for the White House, according to media reports.\n\nTrump spoke to the media after he cast his vote at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on Tuesday morning, according to video posted by the local CBS news station CBS12. Former first lady Melania Trump joined him. \"No matter who you vote for, you have to vote,\" Trump told a sparse crowd outside the polling station.\n\nTrump also repeated that he’ll be making an announcement a week from today at his Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, though he didn't say about what. \"I think Tuesday will be a very exciting day for a lot of people,” Trump said, adding that, “The country has gotten very bad. Its lost its way, its lost its confidence.\"\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nLA voters elect mayor amid political turmoil\n\nLos Angeles voters headed to the polls Tuesday to elect a new mayor amid political tumult in the nation’s second-largest city.\n\nU.S. Rep. Karen Bass, a former state Assembly leader and Democrat who is backed by President Joe Biden, could become the first Black woman to hold the job. She faces developer Rick Caruso, a billionaire Republican turned Democrat, who has campaigned on a platform of change.\n\nThe winner fills the seat of embattled Democrat Eric Garcetti, whose nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India is stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe election comes just weeks after City Hall was embroiled in a racism scandal that led to the ouster of the City Council president and urgent calls for the resignation of two more members. President Nury Martinez resigned after audio leaked of her racist remarks about a colleague’s child and Oaxacan immigrants in the city.\n\n— Susan Miller\n\nCatch up on our election-related fact checks\n\nAccusations, misinterpretations and flat-out lies circulated widely as part of the pre-election debate on social media.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact-Check Team debunked an array of the most common claims in recent weeks, which you’ll find here in our fact check roundup.\n\nOur reporters assembled evidence and expert interviews to address false claims about ballot boxes, mail-in voting and vote counting.

That's double the estimate the county provided earlier in the day.\n\n\"We’re doing what we can to get these back online. It’s not like both of the tabulators are having these issues. It may only be one (at a location),\" Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday morning during an impromptu news conference.\n\nMaricopa County has 223 voting centers.\n\nVoters at impacted sites have two options: to cast their ballot via a secure box to be counted later or to go vote at a different location. Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said poll workers are best equipped to help voters ensure their ballot is successfully cast.\n\n“It’s important for voters to talk to the poll workers on site,” Gilbertson said.\n\n— Anne Ryman and Sasha Hupka\n\nVirginia voters can register today, then vote\n\nVirginia’s same-day voter registration law went into effect last month. In theory, that could make it easier for some folks to vote on Election Day.\n\nSame-day registration ballots are provisional and will be evaluated by local registrars later this week to confirm voter eligibility.\n\nDonald Sutton, the chief election official at the Virginia Beach 5th Precinct, said the new law isn’t a big departure from business as usual.\n\n– Grant Schwab, Medill News Service\n\nVoting problems?

Voting numbers tell the story\n\nMiami-Dade County is one of the biggest and most coveted prizes for any statewide candidate in Florida, and Democrats have owned it for years.\n\nConsider the fact that Miami-Dade hasn’t voted for a Republican since 1988 and hasn’t backed a Republican governor since 2002. That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS: Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, is out of touch in accusing him of being “extreme” and an “election-denier,” saying he will concede the election Tuesday if he loses.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, made those remarks after voting at the Stratham Memorial School in the town where he lives.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nVoting begins smoothly in contested Nevada Senate race\n\nAt the Desert Breeze Community Center outside Las Vegas, approximately 100 people waited in line as the polls opened at 7 a.m. Robert Streat, 73, was among the first to cast a ballot, a personal in-person voting tradition he said dates back decades.\n\nStreat said he opposes Biden's agenda and worries the country is changing too fast from the values he helped defend in Vietnam. He said he supported Republican candidates in the election.\n\n“This country is going to hell if we don’t change it. We’ve got too many people who hate it,\" he said. “We should control the government but we’ve lost it.”\n\nBut Jonathan Copeland, 55, said he worries that Republican control of the House and Senate would mean further erosion of abortion rights, which he supports. Copeland said he voted to help defend the seat of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat in danger of losing to Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. A Laxalt victory would help flip the Senate to Republican control.\n\n\"What politician has the right to tell a woman what to do?\" Copeland said.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nElection watchdog Common Cause reports routine polling problems in battleground states\n\nCommon Cause officials reported during a 10 a.m. news conference routine problems with voting in battleground states, but urged voters who cast ballots by mail to track them and make sure they were counted.\n\nAmy Keith, program director for Common Cause in Florida, said more than 15,000 absentee ballots were flagged by Thursday for problems such as a missing signature. Voters have until Thursday at 5 p.m. to fix the problems, but with a tropical storm hurtling toward the state, Keith urged voters to vote move briskly.\n\nShe said 2.2 million voters voted early in person and another 2.5 million voted early by mail.\n\n“Floridians are coming out to have their voices heard,” Keith said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials see no attacks on election infrastructure yet\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials so far have seen no indications of direct attacks on election infrastructure across the United States in the early hours of mid-term voting Tuesday. But they remain on high alert to disinformation operations and efforts to sway voters’ opinions by nation-states such as Russia, China and Iran, a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters.\n\nThe senior CISA official said those three nations continue to use the election disinformation playbook they have in past elections, and that CISA will continue to support election officials nationwide to any risks that may arise because of them.\n\nIn the first of three election security media briefings scheduled for Tuesday, the official would not say whether such foreign disinformation efforts are worse than in past election cycles, but confirmed that CISA is especially on guard against Russian malign influence campaigns following yesterday’s claim by sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that the Kremlin has meddled in U.S. elections and will continue to do so.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nNew Hampshire governor: Trump announcing 2024 run soon comes at 'worst time'\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican running for reelection, was one of the first in line to cast his ballot, and when asked about reports former President Donald Trump is expected to announce a 2024 presidential run, he said it seemed like poor timing.\n\n“Anyone who thinks it’s a smart idea to announce an election, a potential presidential bid, after (Tuesday’s) election but before Christmas, is just the worst time you could possibly do it,” Sununu said. “My sense is the former president needs better advisers if that’s really what his strategy’s going to be.”\n\nAs he has crisscrossed the country to campaign for Republican midterm candidates, Trump has increasingly hinted that he may launch a 2024 White House bid soon after the midterms. At a Monday night rally in Dayton, Ohio, he told supporters he was planning a \"very big announcement\" on Nov. 15 from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nThere's a reason for all those negative campaign ads...\n\nOn Election Day 2022, Americans are unhappy with the present, pessimistic about the future and not fully enamored with either political party. Their anxious, angry mood helps explain why campaign appeals have mostly turned not on aspirational promises – on exploring space or ending poverty, say – but on ominous warnings about the dangers of supporting the other side.\n\n\"Probably not since even the Civil War (has there been) such a dire situation for our democracy as we are in the current day,\" said John Mark Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.\n\nLessons learned in the midterms include those on the importance of the economy and the emergence of the extremes, among others. Also, the next campaign has already begun, so if you wanted to take a breath before 2024, you’re out of luck.\n\n— Susan Page\n\nIn Ohio, voters to weigh rules for future elections along with Ryan vs. Vance contest\n\nAfter months of campaigns, debates, primaries, absentee and early voting, polls in Ohio opened at 6:30 a.m. EST and will remain open until 7:30 EST.\n\nOne key issue is a ballot measure on rules for future elections. Issue 2 would prohibit noncitizens from voting, proposing that only adult U.S. citizens who legally reside and are registered to vote in Ohio for at least 30 days can cast a ballot in future state and local elections.\n\nThe most high-profile race in the state is the contest between Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan that will help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate. Voters will also choose between incumbent Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and his Democratic challenger Nan Whaley. While polls show a tight race for the Senate seat, DeWine has had a wide lead over Whaley in many polls.\n\n— Micah Walker and Caren Bohan\n\nElection officials: Disrupt ‘at your peril’\n\nTop election officials in key states with tight contests are ready for potential disruptions as voters head to the polls – and the ballots are counted afterward.\n\nIn Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said her office is coordinating closely with law enforcement, deploying dozens of monitors to polling paces, and is prepared to eject poll workers who violate rules.\n\nIn Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office set up a texting system for poll workers in 85 counties to report problems and has state patrol officers and the National Guard ready to provide security.\n\nIn Arizona, Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates said officials throughout the county are ready to respond and are closely coordinating with law enforcement to ensure balloting goes smoothly.\n\n“Our message has been very clear to those who would try and disrupt this election: They do it at their peril,” Gates told reporters at a recent briefing hosted by The Center for Election Innovation & Research. “We're going to respond very strongly to that.”\n\nOne of his biggest worries are influencers on social media trying to sow distrust and misinformation when the results aren’t immediately available after balloting is finished.\n\n“It is tough when you're dealing with people who may have four or six or eight million followers on Twitter and they're saying why don't they have final results in Ari", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/03/election-2024-live-updates-harris-and-trump-make-final-campaign-push/76009369007/", "title": "Election 2024 live updates: Harris and Trump battle in swing states", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Sunday, Nov. 3.

But it’s going to be something.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump hits hard on immigration\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to focus heavily on immigration, repeating at his Georgia rally his claims that the United States \"is now an occupied country.\"\n\n\"The day I take the oath in office the migrant invasion ends,\" Trump said. \"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered.\"\n\nMany people in the country illegally, he said without evidence, are murderers and terrorists. And he said they were taking away jobs, mostly from Black Americans.\n\nBefore criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on immigration, Trump said she is \"running on nothing but hate and demonization.\"\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nIowa can challenge ballots of 2,000 voters on flawed noncitizen list\n\nA federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa poll workers could challenge ballots of more than 2,000 state residents who appeared on a flawed list of possible noncitizens.\n\nIowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, told county auditors on Oct. 22 to challenge the ballots of registered voters who’d previously told the state they were not U.S. citizens.\n\nA group of naturalized citizens and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa sued, saying the challenges wrongly forced naturalized citizens — who are eligible to vote — to clear extra hurdles that other voters did not have to undergo.\n\nU.S. District Judge Stephen Locher wrote Sunday that the decision could stand given that both the state and the plaintiffs agree that some of the individuals on the list are not U.S. citizens.\n\nPate, who acknowledged he was under immense pressure to ensure that only citizens were voting in Iowa, has said that challenged voters can submit provisional ballots and their votes will be counted if they prove their citizenship or the county auditor has verified they are a citizen.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller and Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris calls on Black women organizers\n\nVice President Kamala Harris remained on the tarmac after arriving in Detroit on Sunday night so she could dial into a Win With Black Women organizing call.\n\nHarris dialed into the weekly call to thank her friends and some of the earliest supporters of her campaign.\n\n“This coalition has been in my corner for the last four years, and just four months ago immediately jumped into action with this weekly call to be the first group to organize tens of thousands of Black women in support of our brand new campaign,” Harris said. “You were the catalyst.”\n\nThe day President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, the group held a call that drew 44,000 participants. Other supporters of Harris soon held similar calls.\n\nShe asked them to mobilize their Facebook Groups and family group chats to vote for her.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump in Georgia: `Kamala broke it and I will fix it'\n\nAt a Sunday night rally in Macon, Georgia, former President Donal Trump said the election is a choice between “four more years in gross incompetence and failure” and the “four greatest years in the history of our country.”\n\n“This is really all you need to know,” Trump said. “Kamala broke it, and I will fix it.”\n\nIn 2020, Trump narrowly lost Georgia, one of seven states expected to decide this year’s presidential election.\n\nTrump said the race is “on the 5-yard line, maybe even the 1-yard line.”\n\n“We’re going to close this thing out,” he said, “and it’s going to be party time.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nHarris to Gen Z in Michigan: 'I see your power'\n\nDuring a rally at Michigan State University, Vice President Kamala Harris told young voters that she recognizes the power they hold.\n\nYoung voters are leading the charge to shield the environment from the effects of climate change and protect America’s schools from active shooters, she said, bringing up the Supreme Court’s rollback of reproductive rights.\n\n“None of these issues for you are theoretical. This is not political for you all, this is your lived experience. And I see you. And I see your power. And I am so proud of you,” she said to loud cheers.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris begins Michigan State rally with an appeal to Arab Americans\n\nVice President Kamala Harris started her final Michigan rally with an appeal to the state’s large Arab American population.\n\nAt the start of her remarks at a Sunday evening rally in East Lansing, Michigan, Harris acknowledged the presence of leaders of the Arab American community, which has “deep and proud roots” in the state.\n\n“And I want to say, this year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating,” Harris said. “And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.”\n\nShe was stopped mid-sentence by loud cheering. Continuing, she said she’d work to “bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and self-determination.”\n\nThe Biden administration is still working on a diplomatic resolution across the Israel-Lebanon border, she said, to “protect civilians and provide lasting stability.\n\n“And as president, I will work tirelessly toward a future with security and dignity for all people,” she pledged, before delivering her regular stump speech.\n\nHarris has been interrupted at her rallies over the past several weeks in Michigan and elsewhere by pro-Palestinian protesters who are unhappy about the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. She stressed her support from Arab American leaders earlier on Sunday after she was asked about her closing message to the community.\n\nTrump met with Arab American supporters of his campaign on Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, which has a high concentration of Lebanese Americans.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris rally in Georgia a family affair with Doug Emhoff and Maya Harris\n\nA Harris rally in Atlanta on Sunday was a family affair featuring the vice president’s sister, Maya Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nEmhoff, sporting a black Harris-Walz cap, said he was proud to see his wife address tens of thousands of people at the Eclipse in Washington, D.C.\n\n“My wife is such a badass,’’ he told a packed ballroom. “We saw a president on that stage. We saw a leader.’’\n\nEvery speaker that took the microphone Sunday, including Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat from Georgia, urged the crowd to vote and take others to the polls on Election Day.\n\n“Georgia you can decide this election,” Maya Harris told the crowd, praising people across the country canvassing for the campaign.\n\nGeorgians need to continue showing up in record numbers “so you leave no doubt where you stand,” she said.\n\nEmhoff said it’s the first campaign rally he and Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, have done together. Walz said that unlike Trump, Harris would not go into the White House with an enemy list but with a to-do list.\n\nGeorgia, Walz said, could help Harris win. “Momentum is on our side, but we’re not taking anything for granted,\" he said.\n\n“If we win by one vote it will be Jimmy Carter’s vote,’’ he said to rousing applause.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nKevin McCarthy calls on Donald Trump to campaign with Nikki Haley\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told USA TODAY Sunday that he believes Donald Trump has the “advantage” in the presidential race as it nears its conclusion, but said the former president could be doing more to close the deal.\n\n“You could’ve been more uniting, you know, if you put the Nikki Haleys, others, in there,” said the former congressman from California. “You’re running a general election, not a primary.”\n\nTrump’s former United Nations Ambassador, Haley ran against the former president in the GOP primary and drew support from moderate Republicans, a group Kamala Harris has courted with endorsements from Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney. Haley endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, but hasn’t been on the campaign trail with him.\n\n“To me, it’s all about addition not subtraction,” McCarthy said. “So where am I weak? I bring Nikki Haley in.”\n\nYet McCarthy also believes Trump has “reached out” beyond his base by incorporating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat, into his campaign.\n\nKennedy, who Trump has promised to give a big role on health issues in a future administration, has been campaigning heavily for the former president in the closing stretch. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine advocate whose public comments on health care have drawn widespread backlash.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris stops by chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit\n\nAfter attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.\n\nThe crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.\n\nSpotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nNo word on what the vice president picked up for lunch.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nOprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga to appear at Harris’ final campaign rally Monday night\n\nOprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.\n\nWinfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.\n\nHarris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry, and Andra Day are slated to perform. Later in Philadelphia, Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan, and Adam Blackstone.\n\nThe Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nHarris addresses death toll in Israel-Hamas war\n\nWith just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAsked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.\n\n“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.\n\nHarris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nSupporters gather for Atlanta Harris-Walz rally\n\nThe line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris-Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.”\n\nRenee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia, was among the first to enter the ballroom.\n\n“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’\n\nIt was Cobbs’ second Harris-Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.\n\nCobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped-up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nHarris votes by mail-in ballot\n\nKamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.\n\nHarris, who served as a U.S. Senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.\n\n“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.\n\nHarris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.\n\n“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nRFK Jr: Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.\n\nThe American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevent at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\nWhen reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has \"received a variety of policy ideas\" but \"is focused on Tuesday’s election.\"\n\nBut in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said \"Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,\" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump says he 'shouldn't have left' White House\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he \"shouldn't have left\" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.\n\nAs Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd: \"We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.\"\n\nTrump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAllan Lichtman vs. Nate Silver: Who will accurately predict the 2024 election?\n\nAs voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.\n\nLichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSilver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his \"gut\" tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance's final pitch to Arizona voters ties economic woes to illegal immigration\n\nVisiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale, Arizona, by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.\n\nVance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.\n\n“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.\n\n− Laura Gersony\n\nHarris says election offers opportunity for 'freedom, justice and compassion'\n\nKamala Harris followed her guest appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.\n\nHarris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”\n\nAmericans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”\n\nThe country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5: “We are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”\n\n“Morning is on its way,” she said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nElise Stefanik addresses gender gap between Kamala Harris, Donald Trump supporters\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.\n\nFor example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris' 17-point advantage among women.\n\nStefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”\n\nShe also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better off under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, child care was affordable,” Stefanik said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.\n\n– Cy Neff\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward news media\n\nTalking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n\"I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?\" Trump said to laughs from the crowd.\n\n“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump criticizes polls after surprising Iowa survey\n\nThe former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.\n\n\"The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,\" Donald Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.\n\nTrump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.\n\n\"We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,\" Trump said. \"And fake polls.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump says elections should be 'one day' and on 'paper ballots'\n\nAt a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, on Sunday morning, former President Donald Trump repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”\n\n“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.\n\nA judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from getting their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.\n\nIn Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump campaign adviser dismisses Iowa poll as 'outlier'\n\nTop Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.\n\nThe Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.\n\nTrump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa, pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.\n\nIt’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning female voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\n'It doesn't make you a man': John Fetterman hits Donald Trump comments on transgender right\n\nSen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans' rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”\n\nFetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.\n\n“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDoug Burgum addresses Iowa poll showing Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.\n\nA Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nIn an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.\n\n“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”\n\nThe Republican governor remained optimistic about his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: \"It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Des Moines Register Iowa poll\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.\n\n\"No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,\" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. \"In fact, it’s not even close!\"\n\nEven so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.\n\nA loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigned in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday.\n\n–David Jackson\n\nHarrison Ford, aka Indiana Jones, endorses Kamala Harris\n\nIndiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.\n\nActor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nIn the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”\n\nFord concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorgia Sen. Raphael Warnock pressed on Joe Biden's 'garbage' comment\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock made an appearance Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which Biden appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage.\"\n\nThe president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.\n\n\"As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,\" Warnock said, adding that he believes \"That's what Kamala Harris is doing.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nCould Iowa be shifting back to a presidential swing state? What new poll shows\n\nCould red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?\n\nThe new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.\n\nYet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\n– Des Moines Register staff\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nIt's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFCC commissioner criticizes Harris' 'SNL' appearance\n\nBrendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broken the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.\n\nCarr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a \"clear and blatant effort to evade\" the commission's rules unless NBC offered former President Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.\n\n“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nCarr, appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.\n\n– Karissa Waddick", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/03"}]}

What to know ...", "text": "In a flurry of activity at the end of the week, the Trump administration fired more than 10,000 federal workers across multiple agencies as part of its \"large-scale reductions\" in the government workforce.\n\nThis is likely just the beginning of the job cuts, as President Donald Trump and top White House aide Elon Musk seek to continue slashing agency budgets.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Tuesday seeking a significant reduction in the size of the government. It instructs heads of federal departments and agencies to make \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nThe initial firings focused on – but weren't exclusive to – employees in their first year of their federal job, as they lack the ability longer-term employees have to appeal their terminations. Coupled with about 75,000 workers who took President Trump's buyouts, the job cuts amount to nearly 4% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers.\n\nOverall, about 220,000 federal workers of the total federal government workforce had less than one year of experience as of March 2024, according to the most recently publicly available data from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nHere's where firings have occurred so far.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau: Layoffs and a court challenge\n\nA federal judge on Friday blocked the dismissal of any more workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to multiple reports. More than 100 employees were laid off before the pause, NPR reported. A court challenge was filed by a union representing workers seeking to block Trump's efforts to eliminate the CFPB.\n\nDepartment of Education: Employees fired, put on leave\n\nTermination notices were sent to more than 60 probationary employees across multiple work groups, including the offices of general counsel, special education and rehabilitation services, and federal student aid. Dozens of employees have been put administrative leave, multiple outlets including the New York Times and Washington Post reported, amid the Trump administration's efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion positions from the government.\n\nPresident Trump has said he would like to dismantle the Education Department. Last week, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, announced on X the department canceled nearly $1 billion in educational research contracts, severely limiting the agency's data-collecting arm.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhich agencies are being hit by DOGE? Education Department, USAID, NIH and more\n\nDepartment of Energy job cuts include nuclear agency firings\n\nAbout 1,200 to 2,000 workers in the department were terminated, including some at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and secures radiological materials around the world. Less than 0.5% of the NNSA workforce was dismissed, an Energy Department spokesperson said in a statement.

Trump has also discussed trying to eliminate the Department of Education.\n\nAfter a buyout offer was accepted by fewer federal employees than expected, tens of thousands of federal workers on probation have already been laid off. These probationary workers include employees in their first year or two on the job, people who have recently moved between federal agencies and people who were recently promoted.\n\nThe firings have affected all 50 states and include employees at agencies that Americans frequently interact with including the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Internal Revenue Service, National Institutes of Health and many others. And they have continued as the weeks pass.\n\nThe White House has not responded to repeated requests from USA TODAY for a precise number of fired employees. The firings are expected to shift next month to include workers not in a probationary period.\n\nJan. 20: Trump signs executive order changing job classifications\n\nAmong his first actions as president, Trump signed an executive order that revives a policy from the final days of his first administration known as Schedule F. The directive creates a new employment classification for tens of thousands of nonpartisan career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections by reclassifying them as at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.\n\nA separate executive order froze hiring of federal civilian employees in the executive branch. It states that any federal civilian position vacant when Trump took office may not be filled, and no new position may be created with rare exceptions.\n\nJan. 28: Buyout offer made to federal employees\n\nTrump's administration offered buyouts to nearly all 2.3 million federal employees. The offer came in a surprise email that hit inboxes at 6:04 p.m. on Jan. 28 with the subject line: \"The Fork in the Road.\"\n\nIn the email the U.S. Office of Personnel Management offered all federal employees eight months of pay and benefits through September if they resigned by Feb. 6. Unions warned workers considering Trump’s offer that there is no guarantee the president can or will stick to it because Congress hasn’t approved funding for federal agencies past March 14.\n\nJan. 29: Union sues over reclassifying federal employees\n\nUnions representing federal employees sued the Trump administration to block the schedule F executive order, alleging that it aimed to politicize the federal government by stripping federal workers of job protections.\n\nFeb. 4: USAID employees placed on administrative leave\n\nAbout 10,000 employees of the United States Agency for International Development ‒ two-thirds of whom work overseas across 60 countries ‒ were notified that they will be placed on administrative leave at the end of the week as part of Trump's move to dismantle the foreign aid agency.\n\nFeb. 5: Government warns of furloughs\n\nThe Trump administration warned federal employees that they could be furloughed if they did not accept the buyout offer, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe email warned employees that many will be stripped of civil-service protections and suggested there may be loyalty tests for those who remain.\n\nFeb. 6: Boston judge temporarily halts deadline to accept buyout offer\n\nU.S. District Judge George O’Toole issued a temporary restraining order pausing the Trump administration’s deadline to accept the buyout in order to allow time for labor unions to challenge the plan's legality. The American Federation of Government Employees and two other unions filed the lawsuit arguing that the administration lacks any statutory basis for the \"unprecedented offer.\"\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers had argued that extending the deadline on the very last day would “markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the administration’s efforts to reform the federal workforce.”\n\nAlso on Feb. 6, the administration ordered all federal department and agency heads to produce lists of their lowest-performing employees.\n\nThe order from OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell also asked departments and agencies to identify potential barriers to ensuring \"the ability to swiftly terminate poor performing employees who cannot or will not improve.\"\n\nFeb. 7: Trump fires head of the federal agency dedicated to guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions\n\nAn aide to Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, on the night of Feb. 7 in a one-sentence email. Dellinger sued, arguing that 1978 federal law creating his position states he can only be removed from his job because of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\n\nProbationary employees largely rely on the Special Counsel to back them when challenging a dismissal through the proper government channels rather than suing.\n\nFeb. 10: Trump fires leaders of two internal boards employees use to protest firings\n\nWithin a matter of minutes Trump fired the leaders of two other boards that federal workers can turn to as an avenue to contest their firing. Union challenges to the firings have been rejected because they have not first gone through these boards.\n\nTrump fired Merit Systems Protection Board chair Cathy Harris, just before 11 p.m., leaving the board with two members – Raymond Limon, a Democrat whose term expires Saturday, and Henry Kerner, a Republican. A court temporarily reinstated Harris, whose term doesn't expire until 2028, after she sued. The Merit Systems Protection Board is tasked with protecting federal workers against partisan politics and illegal employment practices. It cannot operate without a quorum.\n\nTrump also fired the Federal Labor Relations Authority board chair, Susan Grundmann, three and a half minutes before he fired Cathy Harris. The authority handles certain complaints with federal workers’ labor unions.\n\nShe’s suing to be reinstated, but for the time being, Trump named Colleen Kiko, a Republican member, as chair, presiding over only one other member, Democrat Anne Wagner.\n\nAlso on Feb. 10, a court temporarily reinstated Dellinger, who promptly asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to pause the terminations of six probationary employees at six agencies, and reinstate them while he investigated their cases. The Supreme Court has declined to take up the administration's case while Dellinger's challenge goes forward.\n\nFeb. 11: Trump signs executive order to make major cuts to federal work force\n\nTrump signed an executive order Feb. 11 that seeks to significantly reduce the size of the government by instructing heads of federal departments and agencies to undertake plans for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nA White House summary of the order said agency heads were ordered to \"coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions.\"\n\nUnder the order, federal agencies aren't allowed to hire more than one employee for every four employees who depart. It also instructed the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to create new rules to ensure future federal hires are subject to additional conduct standards, such as U.S. citizenship and filing federal tax returns on time.\n\nFeb. 12: Judge allows buyouts to move forward\n\nO'Toole, the Boston-based federal judge, restored Trump's buyout project, deciding federal employees unions that sued to stop the program lacked standing to bring their challenge and that his court does not have jurisdiction to hear their complaint.\n\nIn total, about 75,000 federal employees accepted President Donald Trump's buyout offer. That equaled about 3.3% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers, coming in below the White House's projections that 5% to 10% of the workforce would accept. Congress has not yet approved spending for the next year or said spending for buyouts would be included.\n\nFeb. 13: Thousands of probationary employees are fired across the government\n\nThousands of recently hired federal workers received notice that they had been fired.\n\nProbationary workers are easier to fire because they lack the bargaining rights that career employees have to appeal their terminations. Firings were government-wide: from the Department of Education and Small Business Administration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the agency that oversees the nation's fleet of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe firings have continued in the weeks since, including more than 880 probationary employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – which forecasts the nation’s weather and protects ocean species - on Thursday.\n\nFeb. 20: Unions sue over firing probationary employees\n\nA coalition of federal employee unions sued the administration, alleging that officials misused the probationary period to eliminate staff and that the Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to use a standardized termination notice falsely claiming performance issues in firing tens of thousands of employees.\n\n\"OPM, the federal agency charged with implementing this nation’s employment laws, in one fell swoop has perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country, telling tens of thousands of workers that they are being fired for performance reasons, when they most certainly were not,” the unions argued in court documents.\n\nFeb. 24: Office of Special Counsel says firing of probationary employees was illegal\n\nDellinger, who leads the Office of the Special Counsel, said firing probationary employees was illegal because it used boilerplate language blaming their performance rather than specific concerns and asked the Merit Systems Protection Board to decide whether to reinstate six employees while he investigates further.\n\nFederal law generally requires 60 days' notice for a reduction in force (what the federal government calls layoffs) and prohibits probationary employees from being fired for reasons unrelated to performance or conduct.\n\nFeb. 25: Merit Systems Protection Board reinstates some probationary employees\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board orders six fired federal employees to be rehired at least through April 10, while Dellinger's office investigates.\n\n\"I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the six agencies engaged in a prohibited personnel practice,\" stated the order. The Office of Special Counsel has said it is considering ways to seek relief for a broader group of federal employees similarly fired in recent weeks.\n\nFeb. 27: California judge blocks firing of probationary employees\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees.\n\nAlsup said the mass firings were likely unlawful and ordered the Office of Personnel Management to halt the action, saying the agency acted out of bounds by telling other agencies – including the Education Department, the Small Business Administration and the Energy Department – to fire employees.\n\n“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire or fire any employees, but its own,\" Alsup said. The judge did not order the rehiring of anyone who had been terminated.\n\nWhat is ahead?\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered heads of federal departments and agencies to prepare to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" by March 13 as Trump shifts to a more aggressive phase of cutting the federal workforce beyond recently hired or promoted employees.\n\nA memo sent by the Personnel Management and Management and Budget offices has also instructed federal departments to eliminate and consolidate duplicative positions, reduce their property footprints and produce reorganization plans for their agencies.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Kayla Jimenez, Erin Mansfield and Tom Vanden Brook contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/12/trump-doge-federal-layoffs-timeline/82240271007/", "title": "Mass federal layoffs two months into Trump's term: A timeline", "text": "President Donald Trump's mass firings of permanent federal employees have already begun and are expected to accelerate over the next few weeks with tens of thousands more employees terminated.

U.S. Postal Service workers, positions deemed necessary for law enforcement, national security and border and immigration obligations, as well as military personnel in the armed forces are exempted.\n\nThe memo also instructs federal departments to submit new organizational charts by April 14 as well as any proposed relocations of agency offices or headquarters from Washington to \"less-costly parts of the country.\"\n\nFeb. 27: California judge blocks firing of probationary employees\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees.\n\nAlsup said the mass firings were likely unlawful and ordered the Office of Personnel Management to halt the action, saying the agency acted out of bounds by telling other agencies – including the Education Department, the Small Business Administration and the Energy Department – to fire employees.\n\n“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire or fire any employees, but its own,\" Alsup said. The judge did not order the rehiring of anyone who had been terminated.\n\nFeb. 28: A second five things email\n\nThe administration sent a second round of emails to federal workers instructing them to list what they've accomplished that week. The new directive came from agency leaders instead of DOGE.\n\nMarch 5: Firings are up to agencies\n\nIn response to Alsup's ruling, the Trump administration informed federal departments that any firings of their probationary workers are up to the agencies themselves.\n\nThe revised guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that \"OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,\" adding that \"agencies have ultimate decision making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"\n\nThat same day, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reinstate a fired worker, as well as \"numerous\" other probationary employees who were fired Feb. 13 and later.\n\nThe ruling at the request of the Office of Special Counsel who argued the firings violated federal laws related to probationary employees and reductions in force because they used a form letter that the Department of Agriculture also sent to nearly 6,000 other probationary employees.\n\nMarch 6: Trump allowed to fire special counsel\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that Trump did have authority to fire Dellinger, the Office of the Special Counsel leader who said firing probationary employees was illegal because agencies used boilerplate language. Dellinger said he would not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will replace Dellinger with Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins. His agency is laying off workers whose main avenue to contest their firing is to turn to the Office of the Special Counsel for help.\n\nMarch 12: Member back on the Federal Labor Relations Authority\n\nU.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan reversed Trump's Feb. 10 removal of Grundmann, a Democratic member from the Federal Labor Relations Authority, by issuing a permanent injunction requiring the rest of the board to treat Grundmann as if she had not been removed.\n\nThe authority hears disputes between federal agencies and their employees' union and could play a significant role in expected legal fights over the mass layoffs.\n\nWhat is ahead?\n\nHeads of federal departments and agencies have until Thursday to prepare and present plans to initiate \"large-scale reductions in force\" as Trump shifts to a more aggressive phase of cutting the federal workforce beyond recently hired or promoted employees.\n\nAmong the planned reductions, reported by USA TODAY, are terminations of 76,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1,300 workers from the Department of Education, and more than 1,000 workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trump has also openly discussed cuts of 65% to the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce.\n\nLayoffs are not immediate. Agencies must give employees 30 or 60 days notice.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Joey Garrison, Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Kayla Jimenez, Erin Mansfield and Tom Vanden Brook contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/18/trump-administration-reinstates-probationary-employees-court-orders/82512430007/", "title": "Trump administration reinstates thousands of probationary employees", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Trump administration has moved to reinstate at least 24,500 recently fired probationary workers following a pair of orders from federal judges last week that found the terminations pushed by President Donald Trump were illegal.\n\nThe reinstatements, spanning 18 departments, are outlined in a filing Monday by the Department of Justice in federal court in Maryland after a judge asked for a report on efforts to reinstate the employees.\n\nThe separate declarations from Trump officials within each of the departments offer the most detailed public account yet of the administration's firing of recently hired or promoted probationary workers as part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency's push to drastically cut the federal workforce.\n\nThe Treasury Department leads all departments with 7,613 probationary workers who have had their terminations rescinded, with the Internal Revenue Service accounting for the vast majority of these employees, 7,315. It is followed by the Department of Agriculture, which has reinstated 5,714 previously terminated workers, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which has brought back 3,248 employees.\n\nMany of the reinstated federal workers have been placed on paid administrative leave. Workers brought back in some departments will also receive back pay, representatives of these agencies said.\n\nReinstated workers must be onboarded, trained again\n\nTrump officials said they are complying with an order from U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar in Maryland, who set a 1 p.m. EDT deadline Monday for the reinstatements in a case brought by attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia, all Democrats.\n\nBredar, appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled the Trump administration failed to follow proper rules for the terminations, including a requirement to notify states about the layoffs, and wasn't truthful in its claim that the workers were fired for \"performance\" reasons.\n\nSome human resource officials said their departments fully reinstated the probationary workers, who were typically hired or promoted within the past year, while others said they were in the process of doing so as of Monday.\n\nTrump officials also argued in declarations that reinstating recently fired workers could cause \"significant confusion and turmoil\" for the employees, suggesting that the workers could be fired again in a matter of weeks if a higher court reversed the judge's ruling on appeal. They also highlighted the \"substantial burdens\" the process has created for the agencies and employees.\n\nAll employees offered reinstatement to full duty would be onboarded again in their departments, they said. This would include retraining, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, reenrolling in benefits programs, reinstituting applicable security clearances and receiving government-furnished equipment.\n\n\"The tremendous uncertainty associated with this confusion and these administrativeburdens impede supervisors from appropriately managing their workforce,\" Mark Green, an assistant secretary of the Interior Department, which has reinstated 1,710 fired workers, said in his declaration filed with the court.\n\n\"Work schedules and assignments are effectively being tied to hearing and briefing schedules set by the courts. It will be extremely difficult to assign new work to reinstated individuals in light of the uncertainty over their future status,\" Green said.\n\nSecond judge says rehired workers can't be placed on administrative leave\n\nIn a separate order last week, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco demanded the reinstatement of thousands of other probationary workers at six agencies: the Defense, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Energy, Interior and Treasury departments.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said the U.S. Office of Personnel Management – the federal government's human resources agency – lacked the authority to order the firings and did so unlawfully. In a subsequent order Monday, Alsup referenced \"news reports\" about some probationary workers being rehired but then placed immediately on administrative leave.\n\n\"This is not allowed by the preliminary injunction, for it would not restore the services the preliminary injunction intends to restore,\" Alsup said, ordering the six departments to update the court Tuesday on the number of rehired workers placed on leave.\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing both decisions.\n\nThe White House lashed out at the decisions last week, accusing the judges of \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\" In several cases, Trump officials have complained about decisions of Democratic-appointed federal district judges halting their agenda with decisions that affect the entire country.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely ridiculous,\" Trump told reporters Sunday. \"It's a judge that's putting himself in the position of the president of the United States, who was elected by close to 80 million votes. You're having more and more of that. It's a very, very dangerous thing for our country.\"\n\nTrump added: \"I would suspect we're going to have to get a decision from the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe impacted federal departments submitted plans to the White House last week for large-scale \"reductions in force\" within their agencies as part of a deeper second wave of terminations that go beyond probationary workers, targeting career employees. The judges' orders did not apply to these planned terminations.\n\nHere are the tallies of recently fired probationary workers, by department, the Trump administration says it is working to reinstate:\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency: 419 Department of Energy: 555 Department of Commerce: 791 Department of Homeland Security: 310 Department of Transportation: 775 Department of Education: 65 Department of Housing and Urban Development: 299 Department of Interior: 1,710 Department of Labor: 167 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: 117 Small Business Administration: 298 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.: 156 Human Capital and Talen Management: 270 General Services Administration: 366 Treasury Department: 7,613 (including 7,315 IRS employees) Department of Agriculture: 5,714 Department of Veterans Affairs: 1,683 Department of Health and Human Services: 3,248\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/07/all-agencies-trump-doge-layoffs/81851235007/", "title": "These US agencies have all been hit by Trump and Musk's DOGE ...", "text": "Joseph Ax, Val Volcovici and Humeyra Pamuk\n\nReuters\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are undertaking a sweeping campaign to slash the size of the 2.3 million-strong civilian federal workforce, firing or offering buyouts so far to more than 100,000 employees.\n\nThe layoffs to date have primarily been aimed at workers who have been in their current jobs for less than a year and have fewer job protections than longer-tenured staffers. But a new wave of cuts targeting career government workers has begun and will intensify after Trump ordered federal agencies on February 26 to undertake large-scale layoffs.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to give a total number for how many people it has fired.\n\nHere are details on some of the layoffs at federal departments and agencies gleaned by Reuters reporters so far.\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut more than 80,000 workers from the agency, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe VA's chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, sent the memo to senior agency officials, telling them the goal was to return the agency to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would mean cutting about 82,000 staff.\n\nDefense Department\n\nThe Pentagon says it will cut 5,400 jobs. The cuts are a fraction of the 50,000 job losses that some had anticipated, but they might not be the last. Darin Selnick, a top Pentagon official, said the agency will implement a hiring freeze and could ultimately reduce its 950,000-strong civilian workforce by 5% to 8%.\n\nUSAID\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which oversees the delivery of American humanitarian assistance, has said that all direct hires except essential workers will be put on leave and 1,600 USAID personnel in the U.S. will be cut.\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has started the process of firing about 12,000 employees, largely affecting workers hired under the Biden administration as part of an effort to target fraud among wealthy taxpayers. Republicans opposed the expansion, arguing it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans.\n\nOverall, the tax-collecting agency has about 100,000 employees.\n\nThe 12,000 cuts include roughly 7,000 probationary employees and 5,000 workers who have accepted a buyout program, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nCIA\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency fired a slew of recent hires this week, three people familiar with the matter said, cuts that current and former U.S. intelligence officers warned would risk damaging U.S. national security. Reuters could not determine the exact number.\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nAt least 75 career Justice Department lawyers and FBI officials, who normally keep their roles from administration to administration, have either resigned, been fired or stripped of their posts in the first weeks of the Trump administration.\n\nDepartment of the Interior\n\nAround 2,300 workers were laid off from the Interior Department, sources said, including about 800 people from the Bureau of Land Management, which manages millions of federally owned acres for uses ranging from oil and gas development to timber harvesting, recreation and cultural preservation.\n\nOverall, the department employs more than 70,000 people and oversees 500 million acres (202.3 million hectares) of public lands, including dozens of national parks.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service, a division of the Agriculture Department which manages millions of acres of national forests and grasslands, is firing 3,400 probationary employees, equal to 10% of its workforce, people familiar with the plans said.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture said it accidentally fired several employees working on the federal government's response to the H5N1 avian flu outbreak and that it was attempting to rescind those layoffs.\n\nWorkers at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which supports agricultural science and technology research, and the Economic Research Service, which produces reports and data on the farm economy, have also been fired, sources said.\n\nThe extent of layoffs across the Agriculture Department, which employs nearly 100,000 people, remained unclear.\n\nDepartment of State\n\nThe Trump administration has asked U.S. missions worldwide to prepare for staff cuts as part of an overhaul of the U.S. diplomatic corps. Trump says he wants a workforce that will not dither in implementing his policies.\n\nSome embassies had been asked to look into reducing both U.S. staff as well as locally employed staff by 10% each. Already, dozens of contractors working at various State Department bureaus have been laid off.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nThe Associated Press reported that nearly 1,300 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff members had been fired, comprising one-tenth of the agency's workforce.\n\nAt the National Institutes of Health, 1,165 people, mostly probationary employees, were laid off, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which reviews drugs, food safety, medical devices and tobacco, is planning to rehire around 300 people, representing about one-third of the 1,000 FDA workers who have been fired as part of the government cuts. Overall, the FDA has around 20,000 workers.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, NIH and the FDA, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, has more than 80,000 employees. Around 5,200 employees have lost their jobs, STAT News reported.\n\nMore federal workers news: US job cuts surge 245% in February due to federal government layoffs\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA), the agency which provides benefits to tens of millions of older Americans, plans to cut 7,000 workers, it announced on Friday, reducing its workforce by more than 12 percent.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency that provides the U.S. government's weather forecasts, began firing more than 800 workers on February 27, according to congressional sources.\n\nIn addition to everyday forecasting, NOAA - which houses the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center and two tsunami warning centers - provides crucial information to help Americans survive weather emergencies.\n\nDepartment of Energy\n\nAbout 700 workers have been laid off at the Department of Energy, the agency said. Sources have told Reuters that as many as 2,000 workers have been informed they were being laid off and that managers were told to provide evidence for why some of those should be re-hired.\n\nOn February 14, sources said 325 workers had been sent notice that they had been laid off from the National Nuclear Security Administration, an Energy Department office that manages the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal and secures dangerous nuclear materials around the world. But after a public uproar and a scramble by the administration to hire back some of these employees, fewer than 50 workers from the agency were ultimately purged, the Energy Department said on Sunday.\n\nOverall, the Energy Department has about 14,000 employees and 95,000 contractors.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces laws like the Clean Air Act and works to protect the environment, has fired 388 probationary employees. The agency has also placed on leave nearly 200 employees who work on environmental justice programs. The White House has said the EPA plans to cut its spending by 65%.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration\n\nThe FAA fired more than 300 employees out of its workforce of 45,000, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on X, as questions rise around air traffic safety amid a spate of recent plane accidents.\n\nDepartment of Education\n\nAt least 160 recent hires at the Department of Education have been notified of their termination, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Trump has called for the dissolution of the entire department and its 4,400 employees, though Congress would need to approve.\n\nWhile local and state governments hold sway over most educational issues in the United States, the federal department provides billions of dollars in student loans and grants for higher education as well as funding for students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students. The department also enforces civil rights laws.\n\nComptroller of the Currency\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator charged with monitoring large national banks, told staff it was firing 76 probationary employees. In 2024, the OCC reported 3,630 full-time employees, according to its website.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nThe independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is responsible for consumer protection against banks, debt collectors and other companies in the financial sector, has been largely shuttered after the Trump administration ordered it to halt all activity.\n\nRoughly 140 to 200 of the agency's probationary and so-called term employees have been fired, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nGeneral Services Administration\n\nThe General Services Administration received termination letters, according to sources. The independent agency, which manages the government's real estate portfolio and oversees most government contracts, has more than 12,000 workers. Career employees have begun to receive termination notices and the GSA is expected to shutter many regional offices.\n\nGSA leaders have told staff that total spending is expected to be cut across all programs by about 50%, according to an email seen by Reuters.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management\n\nAll probationary employees at the Office of Personnel Management, which handles human resources for the U.S. government, were fired in a group call that included around 100 people, sources said.\n\nOPM has also started to fire career staff, eliminating its entire procurement team and gutting a group overseeing the handling of sensitive employee data within the agency, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration laid off 4% of its staff, a spokesperson said. Under former President Joe Biden, the agency grew by 30% and remains considerably larger after the cuts.\n\nIts workforce was about 800 before the job cuts.\n\nSmall Business Administration\n\nAt least 45 probationary employees at the Small Business Administration were fired in a letter seen by Reuters.

(That starts with a T, and it stands for trouble.)\n\nOver the years, we've accumulated a national debt that now exceeds $36 trillion. A bit of simple math: Last year alone we added a hefty 5% to the total debt that America has accumulated in its 248-year history. That is not sustainable.\n\nIt's why financial experts such as Ray Dalio, founder of the Bridgewater investment firm, say our nation is heading toward a \"debt death spiral.\"\n\nIt's also why honest Democrats such as Jon Lovett, a former aide to President Barack Obama, have acknowledged that President Donald Trump and cost-cutter in chief Elon Musk are fixing problems that should have been addressed long ago.\n\n“Honestly, some of this is pretty annoying because it’s some of the stuff we should’ve done,\" Lovett said on the \"Pod Save America\" podcast. \"You could do some of this.\"\n\nMaybe they should have. And maybe Americans should know what they've been paying for all these years.\n\nThe average federal employee makes almost $40,000 a year more than the typical American worker − $106,382 versus $66,621. And the value of federal employee benefits far outpaces the private sector, including a generous pension system that most employers had to abandon decades ago.\n\nThere's another, largely unspoken, benefit, according to FEDweek: \"The federal government has other perks like job security as it is very difficult to get fired as a federal employee.\"\n\nAt least it was \"very difficult\" until last week.\n\nSize of federal workforce has grown substantially\n\nThe number of federal employees also has increased steadily for years even as the government continues to pile up debt. The federal workforce of 2.4 million, excluding the Postal Service and the military, has grown almost 30% since 2000.\n\nDoes anyone believe that the quality of government services has improved 30% over that time? That − the return on investment for taxpayers − should be the point in hiring and firing, especially for a government that can't pay its bills and faces a financial disaster if dramatic changes aren't made.\n\nOur leaders needed to ask long ago: What is truly essential? How much government can we afford? How do we cut the annual deficit to a sustainable level?\n\nDalio recommends cutting the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product; we're at 6.28%.\n\nI have empathy for the federal workers who already have lost their jobs and for those who may suffer a similar fate in the weeks ahead.\n\nBut I have even more concern for my children and grandchildren and for the millions of Americans whose quality of life will suffer immeasurably if our government can't learn to better manage our money.\n\nTrump and Musk are admittedly imperfect drivers for this transformation.

There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what’s happening?\"\n\nBanks replied, \"Uh, you probably deserved it.\" Schroeder asked him why, and the lawmaker replied \"Because you seem like a clown.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Schroeder told USA TODAY that he found Banks' comments shocking.\n\n“It felt very childish to hear someone in a leadership position whose constituents rely on these programs to say that,” Schroeder said. “I hope a lot of people in his state see the callousness that he demonstrated.”\n\nBanks’ office didn’t immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.

Musk offered federal employees who resigned full pay and benefits through the end of September.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the program was aimed at shrinking the Pentagon's civilian workforce.\n\n\"The net effect will be a reduction in the number of civilian full-time equivalent positions and increased resources in the areas where we need them most,\" the memo read, according to a Defense Department statement.\n\nTobacco prevention office takes a hit\n\nThe job cuts at FDA’s tobacco center came as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention made similar cuts to its tobacco control efforts.\n\nCuts to the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health and Global Health Center were “particularly concerning,” said Tom Frieden, who headed the CDC during the Obama administration.\n\nThe CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health aims to prevent tobacco use, especially among kids, Frieden said.\n\n“No other part of the federal government tracks tobacco use, supports comprehensive action at the community level, and counters threats such as new forms of tobacco products,” Frieden said. “Weakening tobacco prevention is a gift to Big Tobacco that would guarantee more addiction, disease, and death.”\n\nMitch Zeller, who headed the FDA’s tobacco center from 2013 to 2022, said firings at the FDA combined with CDC tobacco prevention cuts were alarming.\n\nHe said he doesn’t see a clear strategy in place for how the Trump administration will prevent smoking and tobacco use, which remains the leading cause of preventable death.\n\n“Every new administration should have the opportunity to come and take their time to reassess and figure out what things could be done better,” Zeller said. “But there's been nothing thoughtful about any of this. It's thoughtless.”\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump administration cuts FDA staff handling bird flu outbreaks\n\nThe Trump administration has fired Food and Drug Administration employees responsible for the federal response to the ongoing bird flu outbreaks, according to former staff and professional groups.\n\nOn Tuesday, leadership and administrative staff at the Center for Veterinary Medicine were among about 140 staff members fired as part of a larger \"reduction in force\" in the 700-person agency, according to two sources with first-hand knowledge.\n\nThe center regulates animal drugs, food and medical devices has played a key role in limiting the spread of the virus to protect people, pets and farm animals.\n\nIn response to questions about cuts to FDA, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred to public statements and a fact sheet from the agency and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nTrump views HHS layoffs as way to save taxpayer money: White House\n\nPresident Donald Trump has delegated the authority to hire and fire federal workers to his Cabinet secretaries and views the layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services as part of the strategy to save money for taxpayers, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n“The president has given the responsibility to his Cabinet secretaries to hire and fire at their respective agencies,” Leavitt told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“You saw the secretary of Health and Human Services announced more layoffs today. This is all part of the administration’s effort for a mass reduction in force in the federal bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C., to save American taxpayers money.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMassive NIH gene study program spared most layoffs so far\n\nA novel National Institutes of Health program that has analyzed the genes of about 150,000 volunteers survived the mass Trump administration layoffs on Tuesday, but the 20 people who do public communications for it have been placed on leave as a preliminary step toward being laid off, one official with the program said.\n\nThe federal All of Us Research Program shares the results of volunteers’ genetic analysis – information on things like how they metabolize medication, as well as their risks for certain diseases.\n\nThe communications division for “All of Us” was severely impacted by the reduction in force, with all of its communications staff being put on administrative leave, one NIH official who works on the program told USA TODAY.\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are now looking for work, said the move will undermine the program itself. The official said that is because some of those put on leave worked on the “All of Us” website, outreach to program volunteers and its website and social media accounts.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nAnti-tobacco group slams ouster of FDA center director\n\nAnti-tobacco groups blasted the removal of Brian King, who headed the Food and Drug Administration’s tobacco center since 2022. King was offered a position at Indian Health Services.\n\nThe layoffs at the FDA’s tobacco center are “deeply irresponsible” and will slow efforts to “protect kids and save lives from tobacco use,” said Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-tobacco group.\n\nRichardson said removing FDA center directors “indicates a troubling move away from science-based regulation to protect public health.”\n\nUnder King’s watch, the FDA cracked down on illegal vapes and proposed slashing nicotine levels in cigarettes, most cigars and other tobacco products.\n\n‒ Ken Alltucker\n\nFDA ‘as we’ve known it is finished’: former commissioner\n\nRobert Califf, a former FDA commissioner during the Obama administration, said Tuesday in a post on LinkedIn that the agency “as we’ve known it is finished,” and he predicted the loss of institutional knowledge would be “a huge mistake.”\n\n“OK, i'm on a coast to coast flight, but i'm overwhelmed with messages about the firings,” Califf wrote. “The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed. I believe that history will see this (as) a huge mistake. I will be glad if I'm proven wrong, but even then there is no good reason to treat people this way. It will be interesting to hear from the new leadership how they plan to put ‘Humpty Dumpty’ back together again.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Democrats launch probe into HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “lackluster response” to bird flu\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday launched an investigation into what they called HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “lackluster response” to the bird flu outbreak.\n\n“We write regarding the widespread outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and your recent comments appearing to minimize the health and economic threat that such outbreaks pose,” the lawmakers, including Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote in a letter to Kennedy. They also requested information about how the Department of Health and Human Services will address the outbreak and associated costs, including coordination plans with other federal agencies.\n\n“Not only has avian influenza infected 70 Americans and killed one, but this pathogen has killed more than 168 million birds since 2022 and is leading to skyrocketing egg prices for consumers as it spreads through poultry and cattle farms,” the lawmakers said.\n\nThe House Democrats questioned Kennedy’s proposal to let avian flu spread in an effort to create “immunity,” saying it contradicts the prevention plans previously announced by other federal agencies under the Trump Administration, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis “strategy” also coincides with the emergence of a new strain of a highly pathogenic bird flu known as H7N9, which surfaced at a poultry farm in Mississippi earlier this month and led to the deaths of 46,000 birds, they said.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nTransportation Department makes buyout offer\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department on Tuesday sent thousands of employees a new buyout offer to leave government service in exchange for pay and benefits through Sept. 30, according to Reuters.\n\nThe offer requires employees to decide by April 7. It exempts public safety positions like Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors as well as railroad safety inspectors, pipeline and hazardous materials safety inspectors and cybersecurity employees.\n\n‒ Reuters\n\nFDA’s chief tobacco regulator is out, amid sweeping cuts at the agency\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration’s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his position amid deep cuts at the FDA and broader federal health agencies, the New York Times and The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nBrian King, the leader of the FDA’s tobacco division, was offered a job with the Indian Health Service in Alaska on Tuesday morning, “a clear ouster from the Trump administration,” according to the New York Times. It said that under King’s leadership, enforcement efforts ramped up against illicit vapes that appeal to teens and that the rates of e-cigarette use by teens fell consistently.\n\nPresident Trump “has pledged to stand up for people who vape and has accepted at least $8 million in campaign funds in recent years from tobacco companies,” the Times reported.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave,” King said in an email to staff, according to the AP.\n\nDozens of other staffers in FDA’s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations, the AP said.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nStates sue over Trump administration attempts to claw back money\n\nA group of Democratic-led states on Tuesday sued Republican President Donald Trump's administration to challenge its cancellation of $11 billion in federal grants allocated to the states during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 23 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island arguing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lacks the authority to unilaterally claw back funding the states had already built health programs around. States are using the grants to track, prevent and control infectious diseases, including measles and bird flu, as well as track mental health services and fund addiction treatment.\n\n– Reuters\n\nUSDA makes early retirement offer\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is offering employees financial incentives to leave the agency this month, according to a Monday evening email sent to staff, according to Reuters.\n\nEmployees at the USDA who opt in to the Deferred Resignation Program by April 8 would be put on administrative leave with full pay and benefits through September 30, the email stated.\n\nThe agency is also offering early retirement to employees who are at least 50 years old with 20 years of federal service, or any age with 25 years of federal service, according to the email.\n\n– Reuters\n\nWhat do the mass layoffs at HHS mean?\n\nThe targeted federal agencies oversee how the nation pays for health care for older Americans and the poor. They also research infectious diseases and public health threats. The overhaul also will bring changes to the agency that scrutinizes the safety of prescription drugs, food and medical devices.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which oversees prescription drug approvals and medical devices in the United States, will terminate 3,500 full-time employees.\n\nHHS said in a news release that the reductions won't affect drug or medical device approvals, but several experts told USA TODAY that the move will overload employees who survive the cuts leading to slow downs in services.\n\n– Ken Alltucker and Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nHead of vaccine agency resigns\n\nAhead of the layoffs, Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the Food and Drug Administration, resigned. In his resignation, Marks criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has questioned the effectiveness of vaccines for years and promoted debunked claims that certain vaccines are linked to autism.\n\n\"It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCory Booker delivers marathon speech to protests cuts\n\nU.S. Sen. Cory Booker is continuing what he promises to be a marathon speech on the Senate floor.

A USA TODAY analysis of the federal workforce explores the answers.\n\nHow many people work for the federal government?\n\nAbout 3 million people were on the federal payroll as of November 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported. That's nearly 2% of the entire civilian workforce in the country. More than 600,000 of those employees work for the U.S. Postal Service ‒ an independent federal agency.\n\nGovernment contractors are not counted as part of the federal workforce, neither are the 1.3 million active-duty military personnel.\n\nAside from federal employees at the Postal Service, there were about 2.4 million federal workers as of last November.\n\nThe Pew Research Center reported that the federal government – not counting the Postal Service – is the nation’s single largest employer, with even more workers than Walmart, Amazon, or McDonald’s.\n\nWhich departments employ the most people?\n\nOf the 18 cabinet-level departments in the executive branch, the Department of Veterans Affairs employs the most people ‒ more than 486,000, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Office of Personnel Management FedScope data. This analysis uses data from March 2024 and does not include postal workers, employees working for intelligence agencies, or presidential appointees who require Senate confirmation.\n\nWithin the Department of Veterans Affairs, most federal employees work for the Veterans Health Administration ‒ a major health care system with a network of hospitals, clinics and nursing homes that provides care to over 9.1 million veterans.\n\nThe Department of Education is the smallest federal agency, employing 4,245 people. Trump has previously stated plans to shut down the Education Department.\n\nThe department oversees nearly $2 trillion in federal student loans, a figure on par with some of the biggest banks. It also protects students from predatory colleges and holds higher education institutions accountable for ensuring their degrees provide a good return on investment.\n\nWhere do federal employees live?\n\nMore than 80% of the federal workforce lives outside of the Washington, D.C., metro area. About 454,000 federal employees work in the district, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nCalifornia and Texas have a large concentration of federal employees, about 147,500 and 130,000, respectively, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat are the most common jobs in the federal government?\n\nNearly 364,000 federal employees, or 16% of the federal workforce, are in health-related fields – the single largest occupational category.\n\nWho has lost their jobs so far?\n\nMass firings of federal workers thus far have focused primarily on eliminating recently hired or promoted probationary workers. This first round of firings came after buyouts were offered to all federal employees, which more than 75,000 workers accepted.\n\nWhile the exact number of federal employees affected by layoffs is not yet known, the following departments have been affected:\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nApproximately 6,000 employees at the IRS were set to be laid off starting Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nThe Department of Defense announced on Feb. 21 that it planned to reduce its civilian workforce by 5%-8% by laying off about 5,400 probationary employees beginning the following week.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nMore than 400 employees, identified as \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status,\" were fired at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USA TODAY recently reported.\n\nDepartment of the Interior\n\nAt least 2,300 federal workers had their positions terminated. Among them were 800 Bureau of Land Management employees and about 1,000 National Park Service workers.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration\n\nAbout 400 recently hired support staff employees at the FAA were fired on Feb. 14 as part of the Trump administration's mass terminations of federal workers, according to the union representing the employees.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nThousands of probationary employees were fired across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to multiple reports.\n\nRoughly 700 workers were let go at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to The Associated Press and NPR,\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nAbout 10,000 USAID employees, excluding essential personnel, were placed on administrative as of Feb. 7, and battles over the federal funding freeze are underway in court.\n\nSmall Business Administration\n\nAbout 20% of the agency's staff, or about 720 SBA employees, including hundreds of probationary employees, were fired, Politico reported.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\nAbout 3,400 probational workers, or nearly 10% of the Forest Service workforce of 35,000 employees were laid off.\n\nOther agencies and departments that experienced layoffs include: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Kinsey Crowley, Joey Garrison and Mike Snider, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/18/federal-employees-fired-rehired-await-court-decision/83600693007/", "title": "Thousands of federal employees are on a roller coaster of being ...", "text": "In recent months, tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, rehired and threatened with firing again.\n\nFor now, they have a two-week reprieve, after a federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration not to carry out any additional firings for two weeks, but the administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling.\n\nBut employees describe weeks of uncertainty, worry and doubt as their jobs are off, then on, then off again.\n\n\"This entire chaos-causing situation has been inefficiency in the name of efficiency,\" said one federal employee who received a reduction in force notification, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. \"I was RIF'd then told I'm not. It makes it very hard to know what to believe and makes it incredibly difficult to trust your employer.\"\n\nThousands of probationary workers were fired in February. In response to a series of court rulings, the employees were rehired, then fired again. Separately, thousands of employees departed under a voluntary program known as the \"fork in the road.\" Then in April and May thousands more left under incentive-based programs to leave or retire early. Some of those who chose to leave in that third round had their requests rejected.\n\n\"Emotionally this has been draining on me and my family and has impacted every facet of our lives,\" the federal employee told USA TODAY. \"It increases your stress, ruins your work life balance, and really strains your home life.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston issued a temporary restraining order on May 9 against the government's planned reductions in force in a case in the Northern District of California. President Donald Trump and the offices driving the budget and personnel reductions likely exceeded their authority, Illston wrote.\n\nHer order blocked any action on the planned terminations of more than 100,000 employees at 21 agencies and departments until May 23. However, on May 16, after a flurry of back-and-forths with the court, the Trump administrative appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Illston's restraining order.\n\nThe order addressed concerns laid out among 1,000 pages of evidence presented in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Government Employees and two dozen other plaintiffs, including other union locals, nonprofits and local governments. The president may have the ability to pursue new policy priorities but can’t make large-scale changes to an agency without Congress, “its co-equal branch and partner,” the order stated. It added, “Unchecked presidential power is not what the Framers had in mind.\"\n\nThe order directed agencies not to approve any reductions in force and to complete no further implementation of Trump's executive order or memos from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. Another hearing was scheduled for May 22.\n\nThe California case is one of dozens of lawsuits against the administration. Scores of injunctions have been issued by both Democratic and Republican appointed judges in very different jurisdictions, Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor, said during a May 14 webinar. Illston was appointed by President Bill Clinton.\n\nFeds resist releasing reorganization plans\n\nAlthough Illston directed the government to turn over copies of the planned reductions in force and reorganizations, the government resisted, saying the documents are privileged and \"simply irrelevant to future proceedings of the court.\" As it stands now, the government is supposed to provide copies of two reorganization plans from agencies of its choosing to the court for her to review by noon on May 19.\n\nMany agencies already have reported the departure of 10% to 20% of their employees through the firings of probationary employees and an assortment of voluntary retirements and incentive-based departures. Based on the documents in the case filed by the government employees federation, Illston's order included the following planned staff reductions:\n\nHealth and Human Services would fire 8,000-10,000, making a total of at least 20,000 departures this year, more than 20% of the staff.\n\nEnergy Department would cut 8,500, nearly half its workforce.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, already down by an estimated 2,000 employees could reduce its remaining workforce of an estimated 10,000 people by more than half.\n\nInternal Revenue Service would reduce its remaining staff by 40%.\n\nNational Science Foundation would eliminate roughly half of its 1,700 employees.\n\nVeterans Affairs plans to cut 83,000 positions.\n\nSmall Business Administration would cut its work force by 40%.\n\nThe order also stated the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health would fire 221 of the 222 employees in its Pittsburgh office, which researches health hazards faced by mine workers. However, in testimony during a Congressional budget hearing on May 14, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he had ordered about 100 of those positions to be reinstated.\n\nAdditionally, Kennedy said, he'd ordered 100 positions restored in West Virginia and 100 in the World Trade Center health program. In total, the department's planned reduction would take the number of employees back to 2019 levels, he said.\n\nGrilled by legislators about the process, Kennedy said the simplest analysis at the outset was that the federal government was spending $2 trillion a year it didn't have. Kennedy said Elon Musk, who was heading up the Department of Government Efficiency for Trump, gave them help in figuring out where there was \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" a catch phrase frequently used both by this administration and previous administrations.\n\nKennedy did not give any additional details, saying he's under a \"court order not to do any further planning on the reorganization, and I've been advised by my attorneys not to talk about it.\" He added that some of the rumored cuts weren't cuts at all but were programs transferred to the new \"Administration for a Healthy America.\"\n\nIn an effort to backfill the gaps at regional forecast offices, the National Weather Service is offering its employees the opportunity to move to other locations.\n\nThe reductions in force already had been set into motion in several agencies. The agencies had been required by the administration to file the first phase of the reorganizations by March 13, and the second phase, including the reductions in force, were due April 14.\n\nReductions had started at Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, AmeriCorps and the Small Business Administration, according to court documents.\n\nAlthough the Department of Governmental Efficiency has attracted a lot of attention for its cuts to contracts, the order makes it clear that the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management are playing key roles in the efforts to reduce budgets and staff.\n\nAmong those in the president's inner circle who have been very involved is Russell Vought, budget office director in this administration and Trump's previous administration. Vought was a key author of the Heritage Foundation's \"Project 2025\" and has been vocal about his intentions to reduce the size of the federal government. In one private speech in 2023, video obtained by Pro Publica shows Vought saying, \"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.\"\n\nIn a Feb. 26 memo to agencies and departments he wrote: \"The American people registered their verdict on the bloated, corrupt federal bureaucracy on November 5, 2024 by voting for President Trump and his promises to sweepingly reform the federal government.\"\n\nDOGE was announced just before the election last fall. Implemented by executive order on Inauguration Day, the Musk-led DOGE has overseen steep cuts to spending and contracts. Its workers have clashed with information technology experts and attorneys at several agencies. Employees and members of Congress also have flagged concerns about the use of artificial intelligence to search contracts, websites and emails for key words such as diversity and climate change and to scan employee emails for anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nMusk, a senior adviser to the president, recently indicated he would be backing away from heavy involvement at DOGE because his companies need him. In an hourlong interview on May 1 with a small group of media outlets including USA TODAY, Musk said he plans to spend a day or two a week working on DOGE going forward. Musk accompanied Trump and his entourage in mid-May on an official visit to the Middle East.\n\nIllston's order found that neither DOGE, the budget office or the personnel office likely had the authority to direct federal agencies to engage in large-scale terminations, restructuring or elimination.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver is a national correspondent for USA TODAY.

Under current U.S. law, Americans cannot lose their citizenship even if they obtain citizenship in a foreign country.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/25/trump-judges-judiciary-rulings-court-clash/83598781007/", "title": "How Trump's clash with the courts is brewing into an 'all-out war'", "text": "Conservative activists are also bombarding Congress with demands to rein in federal judges.\n\nActivists on the right are adopting some of the language being employed by Trump critics about an impending constitutional crisis, but with a very different meaning.\n\nTrump's actions have sparked nearly 250 legal challenges so far. The court cases have resulted in at least 25 nationwide injunctions through late April temporarily halting Trump's actions\n\nArresting judges. Threatening their impeachment. Routinely slamming them on social media and trying to go around them completely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies have led an intense pressure campaign on the judiciary four months into his administration. Both sides of the political spectrum are using the term constitutional crisis.\n\n“It’s an all-out war on the lower courts,” said former federal Judge John Jones III, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nAs the clash becomes a defining moment in the president's second term, conservative activists are pushing Congress to rein in federal judges and pressing Trump to intensify his fight with the courts. The Article III Project, a Trump-aligned group, arranged 164,000 phone calls, emails and social media messages to members of Congress in recent weeks urging lawmakers to back Trump in this judiciary fight. They called for impeaching Judge James Boasberg - one of the federal judges who has drawn MAGA's ire - after he ordered a temporary halt to Trump's effort to deport some immigrants. They also want lawmakers to cut the federal budget for the judiciary by $2 billion after Judge Amir Ali ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze that amount of foreign aid.\n\nThe group is supporting bills introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, aimed at stopping federal district judges from issuing nationwide court orders, which have blocked some of Trump's policies. Mike Davis, a former Republican Senate aide and the Article III Project's founder and leader, said the legislation sends a message to Chief Justice John Roberts as the Supreme Court weighs taking a position on the injunctions. Issa's bill has cleared the House, while Grassley's has yet to advance.\n\n\"It’s really effective,\" Davis said. \"When you talk about these legislative reforms it scares the hell out of the chief justice.”\n\nConstitutional crisis warnings\n\nPizzas have been sent anonymously to the homes of judges and their relatives, prompting judges to raise concerns about apparent intimidation tactics. In his year-end report in December, Roberts warned that the court's independence is under threat from violence.\n\nActivists on the right are adopting some of the language being employed by Trump critics about an impending constitutional crisis, but with a very different meaning: opponents say Trump threatens the Constitution's separation of powers by ignoring court rulings, while Trump supporters say judges are usurping the president's rightful executive authority. Both argue that the nation is at a perilous moment.\n\nSteve Bannon − the president's former White House chief strategist − is predicting an explosive summer of crisis with the judicial battle at the center, saying on his podcast recently that the nation is approaching \"a cataclysmic” moment. Many of Trump's critics agree, but believe it's a crisis of Trump and the right's own making.\n\n\"Some allies of the administration are inviting the constitutional crisis... because they want to enfeeble our judiciary and destroy our system of checks and balances,\" said Gregg Nunziata, an aide for Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he was in the Senate and now the executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law, a group founded by conservative legal figures from previous Republican administrations.\n\nExecutive orders and a clash between government branches\n\nTrump has pushed the boundaries of executive power during his first four months in office with aggressive moves that are drawing legal challenges, including shuttering whole federal agencies, mass layoffs of federal workers, firing members of independent board and taking dramatic steps to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe also has invoked a 1798 wartime law to more quickly whisk people out of the country.\n\nTrump's actions have sparked nearly 250 legal challenges so far. The court cases have resulted in at least 25 nationwide injunctions through late April temporarily halting Trump's actions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nFrustrated with unfavorable court decisions, the administration has taken an increasingly hostile stance to the federal bench. Trump complained in a May 11 social media post about a “radicalized and incompetent Court System.”\n\n“The American people resoundingly voted to enforce our immigration laws and mass deport terrorist illegal aliens,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai. \"Despite what activist judges have to say, the Trump administration is legally using every lever of authority granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to deliver on this mandate.”\n\nThe clash with the courts has sparked talk of a breakdown in the constitutional order. After the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador and the administration continued to resist bringing him back, U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, declared: \"The constitutional crisis is here. President Trump is disobeying lawful court orders.\"\n\nBannon talked in an NPR interview about a \"constitutional crisis that we're hurtling to.\" Trump and allies such as Davis have complained that the judges ruling against him are left wing partisans. \"Once judges take off their judicial robes and enter the political arena and throw political punches, they should expect powerful political counter punches,\" Davis said.\n\nYet some of the president's biggest legal setbacks have come from Republican-appointed judges, including multiple judges appointed by Trump. Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas is a Trump appointee who ruled against him on using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants. Another Trump appointee, Judge Trevor McFadden with the D.C. District, ruled last month that the Trump administration must reinstate access to presidential events for the Associated Press news agency, which had been barred because it continued to use the term \"Gulf of Mexico\" instead of Gulf of America in its coverage.\n\nJones, who had a lifetime appointment to serve as a federal judge beginning in 2002 until he left to become president of Dickinson College in 2021, called the rhetoric directed at judges by the Trump administration \"abominable... and entirely inappropriate.\"\n\n\"It absolutely misrepresents the way the judges decide cases,\" he said. \"And unfortunately, many people are listening to this and and they're getting a completely mistaken impression of how judges do their jobs.\"\n\nDue process rights, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention has been due process rights, which are guaranteed under the Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They prohibit the federal and state governments from depriving any person “of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”\n\nThe same rights American citizens have to contest government actions against them in court extend to undocumented immigrants facing detention and deportation.\n\nTrump came into office promising mass deportations and has moved aggressively, including invoking the Alien Enemies Act, which allows for the targeting of certain immigrants \"without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship,\" according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nCourts have balked at his tactics.\n\nIn the most high-profile case, the Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe Supreme Court on May 16 also temporarily blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to more quickly deport a group migrants held in Texas, sending the case back to the appeals court to decide the merits of whether the president’s use of the legislation is lawful, and if so what process should be used to remove people.\n\nThe administration hasn’t brought Abrego Garcia back, and Trump has expressed frustration with the judiciary’s insistence on due process. He lashed out after the latest Supreme Court ruling, writing on social media that the court \"is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do.\"\n\nTrump Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller brought up the debate on May 9 when he said the administration is investigating suspending habeas due process rights, which only is allowed by the Constitution to preserve public safety during “Rebellion or Invasion.”\n\n“It’s an option we’re actively looking at,” Miller said. “Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”\n\nConservative media figure Rogan O'Handley told USA TODAY he saw online commentary about suspending habeas corpus and began promoting it to the 2.2 million followers of his @DC_Draino X handle. He said he was dismayed by the judicial rulings against Trump’s immigration agenda and seized on the idea to “get around” the courts.\n\n“We had to step up the intensity of our tactics,” he said.\n\nO’Handley went on Bannon’s podcast April 22 to promote suspending habeas. He was invited to join the White House press briefing on April 28 and asked a question about it. Two days later, on April 30, Trump was asked during a Cabinet meeting about his administration’s planned response to the rash of nationwide injunctions against his deportation efforts and seemed to allude to suspending habeas.\n\nThe idea – last done in Hawaii in 1941 after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor – highlights how the Trump administration is determined to push through any legal or constitutional obstacle to its deportation plans.\n\nTrump and Chief Justice John Roberts\n\nAmong Trump's biggest obstacles so far during the second term is the judiciary, which repeatedly has blocked some of his actions, calling his methods unlawful and drawing his ire.\n\n“We need judges that are not going to be demanding trials for every single illegal immigrant,\" Trump told reporters recently on Air Force One. \"We have millions of people that have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person.”\n\nImmigration cases don't go before a jury, but instead are decided solely by an immigration judge.\n\nMiller has complained about a “judicial coup” while Bannon, the podcaster and White House chief strategist during Trump's first administration, says there is a “judicial insurrection.”\n\nThe conflict has been brewing for months.\n\nTrump said March 18 on social media that a federal judge who ruled against him in an immigration case should be impeached, drawing a rare rebuke from Roberts, the chief justice of the United States and another Bush appointee.\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in March.\n\nTensions have only escalated.\n\nOn April 25 federal authorities announced charges against a Wisconsin judge and former New Mexico judge, accusing them of hampering immigration enforcement efforts. Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty May 15.\n\nOn May 22, the House passed Trump's sweeping tax legislation and included language inside the more than 1,100-page measure that could protect the Trump administration if a judge determined officials violated a court order. The language limits a judge's ability to hold someone in contempt of court if they \"fail to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order.\"\n\nSuspending habeas corpus?\n\nConstitutional scholars told USA TODAY the Trump administration can’t suspend habeas corpus without congressional approval.\n\n“If President Trump were to unilaterally suspend habeas corpus that’s flagrantly unconstitutional,” said University of North Carolina School of Law professor Michael Gerhardt.\n\nDuke Law Professor H. Jefferson Powell, a former deputy solicitor general during Democratic President Bill Clinton’s administration, said “the standard position of the vast majority of constitutional lawyers is that Congress alone” can suspend habeas corpus.\n\n“This is not a close call,” he said.\n\nAny attempt to suspend due process rights would be a shocking move, the equivalent of a “legal earthquake,” said Jones.\n\nMiller’s comments added to the growing alarm among those concerned the Trump administration is threatening the rule of law and a constitutional crisis.\n\nJudges have reprimanded the Trump administration for not following their rulings. Boasberg found probable cause last month to hold the administration in contempt for \"deliberately and gleefully\" violating one of his orders. And Judge Brian Murphy with the Federal District Court in Boston ruled May 21 that the Trump administration \"unquestionably\" violated his order not to deport people to countries that are not their own without giving them an opportunity to contest the move.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a May 22 press briefing that the \"administration has complied with all court orders,\" slammed Murphy's ruling and complained about \"radical\" judges.\n\nMurphy is \"undermining our immigration system, undermining our foreign policy and our national security,\" Leavitt said.\n\nJones said the administration is playing “games with the lower courts” but the real sign of a constitutional crisis would be if the Supreme Court sets a “bright line” that the Trump administration disregards.\n\n\"We’re on the verge, maybe, of that,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/us/white-christian-nationalism-blake-cec", "title": "An 'imposter Christianity' is threatening American democracy | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThree men, eyes closed and heads bowed, pray before a rough-hewn wooden cross. Another man wraps his arms around a massive Bible pressed against his chest like a shield. All throughout the crowd, people wave “Jesus Saves” banners and pump their fists toward the sky.\n\nAt first glance, these snapshots look like scenes from an outdoor church rally. But this event wasn’t a revival; it was what some call a Christian revolt. These were photos of people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe insurrection marked the first time many Americans realized the US is facing a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement. This movement uses Christian language to cloak sexism and hostility to Black people and non-White immigrants in its quest to create a White Christian America.\n\nA report from a team of clergy, scholars and advocates — sponsored by two groups that advocate for the separation of church and state — concluded that this ideology was used to “bolster, justify and intensify” the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nDemonstrators pray outside the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the House January 6 committee’s focus so far has been on right-wing extremist groups. But there are plenty of other Americans who have adopted teachings of the White Christian nationalists who stormed the Capitol — often without knowing it, scholars, historians, sociologists and clergy say.\n\nWhite Christian nationalist beliefs have infiltrated the religious mainstream so thoroughly that virtually any conservative Christian pastor who tries to challenge its ideology risks their career, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of the New York Times bestseller, “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.”\n\n“These ideas are so widespread that any individual pastor or Christian leader who tries to turn the tide and say, ‘Let’s look again at Jesus and scripture,’ are going to be tossed aside,” she says.\n\nThe ideas are also insidious because many sound like expressions of Christian piety or harmless references to US history. But White Christian nationalists interpret these ideas in ways that are potentially violent and heretical. Their movement is not only anti-democratic, it contradicts the life and teachings of Jesus, some clergy, scholars and historians say.\n\nSamuel Perry, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma who is authority on the ideology, calls it an “imposter Christianity.”\n\nHere are three key beliefs often tied to White Christian nationalism.\n\nA belief that the US was founded as a Christian nation\n\nOne of the banners spotted at the January 6 insurrection was a replica of the American flag with the caption, “Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.”\n\nErasing the line separating piety from politics is a key characteristic of White Christian nationalism. Many want to reduce or erase the separation of church and state, say those who study the movement.\n\nOne of the most popular beliefs among White Christian nationalists is that the US was founded as a Christian nation; the Founding Fathers were all orthodox, evangelical Christians; and God has chosen the US for a special role in history.\n\nThis painting chronicles lawmakers' signing of the Constitution of the United States in 1787. MPI/Getty Images\n\nThese beliefs are growing among Christians, according to a survey last year by the Barna Group, a company that conducts surveys about faith and culture for communities of faith and nonprofits. The group found that an “increasing number of American Christians believe strongly” that the US is a Christian nation, has not oppressed minorities, and has been chosen by God to lead the world.\n\nBut the notion that the US was founded as a Christian nation is bad history and bad theology, says Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University and co-author of “The Flag and the Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy.”\n\n“It’s a half truth, a mythological version of American history,” Gorski says.\n\nSome Founding Fathers did view the founding of the nation through a Biblical lens, Gorski says. (Every state constitution contains a reference to God or the divine.)\n\nBut many did not. And virtually none of them could be classified as evangelical Christians. They were a collection of atheists, Unitarians, Deists, and liberal Protestants and other denominations.\n\nA Trump supporter holds a Bible as he gathers with others outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nThe Constitution also says nothing about God, the Bible or the Ten Commandments, Gorski says. And saying the US was founded as a Christian nation ignores the fact that much of its initial wealth was derived from slave labor and land stolen from Native Americans, he says.\n\nFor evidence that the United States was founded as a secular nation, look no further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, an agreement the US negotiated with a country in present-day Libya to end the practice of pirates attacking American ships. It was ratified unanimously by a Senate still half-filled with signers of the Constitution and declared, “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on Christian religion.”\n\nDoes this mean that any White Christian who salutes the flag and says they love their country is a Christian nationalist? No, not at all, historians say. A White Christian who says they love America and its values and institutions is not the same thing as a White Christian nationalist, scholars say.\n\nGorski also notes that many devout Black Americans have exhibited a form of patriotism that does not degenerate into Christian nationalism.\n\nAmerican social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, circa 1880. Graphic House/Getty Images\n\nGorski points to examples of the 19th century abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both were devout Christians who expressed admiration for America and its founding documents. But their patriotism also meant that “they challenged the nation to live up to its highest principles, to become a place of freedom, equality, justice and inclusion,” he says.\n\nThe patriotism of White Christian nationalists, on the other hand, is a form of racial tribalism, Gorski says.\n\n“It’s a ‘My tribe. ‘We [White people] were here first. This is our country, and we don’t like people who are trying to change it or people who are different’ form of nationalism,” Gorski says.\n\nA belief in a ‘Warrior Christ’\n\nVideos from the January 6 attack show a chaotic, tear-gas-soaked scene at the Capitol that looked more like a medieval battle. Insurrectionists punched police officers, used flagpoles as spears and smashed officers’ faces against doors while a mob chanted, “Fight for Trump!” The attack left five people dead and nearly 140 law enforcement officers injured.\n\nThe incongruity of people carrying “Jesus Saves” signs while joining a mob whose members are pummeling police officers leads to an obvious question: How can White Christian nationalists who claim to follow Jesus, the “Prince of Peace” who renounced violence in the Gospels, support a violent insurrection?\n\nA protester holds up a Bible amid the crowd storming the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington on January 6, 2021. Ashley Gilbertson/VII/ Redux/\n\nThat’s because they follow a different Jesus than the one depicted in the Gospels, says Du Mez, who is also a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University — a Christian school — in Michigan. They follow the Jesus depicted in the Book of Revelation, the warrior with eyes like “flames of fire” and “a robe dipped in blood” who led the armies of heaven on white horses in a final, triumphant battle against the forces of the antichrist.\n\nWhite Christian nationalists have refashioned Jesus into a kick-butt savior who is willing to smite enemies to restore America to a Christian nation by force, if necessary, Du Mez and others say.\n\nWhile warlike language like putting on “the full armor of God” has long been common in Christian sermons and hymns, it has largely been interpreted as metaphorical. But many White Christian nationalists take that language literally.\n\nThat was clear on January 6. Some insurrectionists wore caps emblazoned with “God, Guns, Trump” and chanted that the blood of Jesus was washing Congress clean. One wrote “In God We Trust” on a set of gallows erected at the Capitol.\n\n“They want the warrior Christ who wields a bloody sword and defeats his enemies,” says Du Mez. “They want to battle with that Jesus. That Jesus brings peace, but only after he slays his enemies.”\n\nAnd that Jesus sanctions the use of righteous violence if a government opposes God, she says.\n\n“If you deem somebody in power to be working against the goals of a Christian America, then you should not submit to that authority and you should displace that authority,” she says. “Because the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means.”\n\nSupporters of then-President Donald Trump gather on the Ellipse near the White House to hear him speak on January 6, 2021. Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nThat ends-justify-the means approach is a key part of White Christian nationalism, says Du Mez. It’s why so many rallied behind former President Trump on January 6. She says he embodies a “militant White masculinity” that condones callous displays of power and appeals to Christian nationalists.\n\nBut with few exceptions, White Christian nationalists do not accept this “militant masculinity” when exhibited by Black, Middle Eastern and Latino men, Du Mez writes in “Jesus and John Wayne.” Aggression by people of color “is seen as a threat to the stability of home and nation,” she writes.\n\nWisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson echoed this double standard last year when he said on a radio talk show that he never really felt threatened by the mostly White mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\n“Now, had … President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson later elaborated, saying “there was nothing racial about my comments– nothing whatsoever.”\n\nThis embrace of a warrior Christ has shaped some White evangelicals’ attitudes on issues ranging from political violence to gun safety laws.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute revealed that of all respondents, White evangelicals were the religious group most likely to agree with the statement, “true American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save the country.”\n\nThere are also some White Christian nationalists who believe the Second Amendment was handed down by God.\n\nGun rights activists carrying semi-automatic firearms pose for a photograph in the state Capitol Building on January 31, 2020, in Frankfort, Kentucky. Bryan Woolston/Getty Images\n\nSamuel Perry, co-author of “Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,” wrote in a recent essay that among Americans surveyed who believe “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation,” over two-thirds rejected the idea that the federal government should enact stricter gun laws.”\n\n“The more you line up with Christian nationalism, the less likely you are to support gun control,” wrote Perry. “Guns are practically an element of worship in the church of white Christian nationalism.”\n\nA belief there’s such a person as a ‘real American’\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduced a new term to the political discourse. She talked about “the real America” and the “pro-America areas of this great nation.” Since then, many conservative political candidates have used the term “real Americans” to draw contrasts between their supporters and their opposition.\n\nSuch language has been co-opted into a worldview held by many White Christian nationalists: The nation is divided between “real Americans” and other citizens who don’t deserve the same rights, experts on White Christian nationalism say.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin speaks at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nGorski, author of “The Flag and the Cross,” says he found in his research a strong correlation between White Christian nationalism and support for gerrymandering—an electoral process where politicians manipulate district lines to favor one party or, some critics say, race over another. He found similar support among White Christian nationalists for the Electoral College, which gives disproportionate political power to many rural, largely White areas of the country.\n\nWhen White Christian nationalists claim an election was stolen, they are reflecting the belief that some votes don’t count, he says.\n\n“It’s the idea that we are the people, and our vote should count, and you’re not the people, and… you don’t really deserve to have a voice,” Gorski says. “It doesn’t matter what the voting machines say, because we know that all real Americans voted for Donald Trump.”\n\nWhy White Christian nationalism is a threat to democracy\n\nThose who want the US to become a Christian nation face a huge obstacle: Most Americans don’t subscribe to their vision of America.\n\nThe mainstreaming of White Christian nationalism comes as a growing number of Americans are rejecting organized religion. For the first time in the US last year, membership in communities of worship fell below 50%. Belief in God is at an all-time low, according to a recent Gallup poll.\n\nA parishioner bows his head to pray while celebrating midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 24, 2021, in New York City. Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAdd to that the country’s growing racial and religious diversity. People who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the census began in 1790, and the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.\n\nOn the surface, White Christian nationalism should not be on the ascent in America.\n\nSo White Christian nationalists look for salvation from two sources.\n\nOne is the emboldened conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, where recent decisions overturning Roe vs. Wade and protecting school prayer offer them hope.\n\nCritics, on the other hand, say the high court is eroding the separation of church and state.\n\nNot all Christians who support the high court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and its school prayer decision are White nationalists. For example, plenty of Roman Catholics of all races support racial justice yet also backed the overturning of Roe.\n\nBut White Christian nationalists are inspired by those decisions because one of their central goals is to erase the separation of church and state in the US.\n\nA recent study concluded that five of the justices on the Supreme Court are the “most pro-religion since at least World War II,” and that the six conservative justices are “all Christian, mostly Catholic,” and “religiously devout.”\n\nThe sun sets in front of the Supreme Court on June 28, 2022, in Washington. A Supreme Court decision last month overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and erased a federal right to an abortion. Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nWhile some Americans fear the dangers of one-party rule, others like Pamela Paul, a columnist, warn of the Supreme Court instituting one-religion rule.\n\n“With their brand of religious dogma losing its purchase, they’re imposing it on the country themselves,” she wrote in a recent New York Times editorial.\n\nGorski, the historian, says White Christian nationalism represents a grave threat to democracy because it defines “we the people” in a way that excludes many Americans.\n\n“The United States cannot be both a truly multiracial democracy – a people of people and a nation of nations – and a white Christian nation at the same time,” Gorski wrote in “The Flag and the Cross.” “This is why white Christian nationalism has become a serious threat to American democracy, perhaps the most serious threat it now faces.”\n\nThe other source of hope for White Christian nationalists is a former occupant of the White House. Their devotion to him is illustrated by one of most striking images from the January 6 insurrection: A sign depicting a Nordic-looking Jesus wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nIf Trump returns to the presidency, some White Christian nationalists may interpret his political resurrection as divine intervention. His support among White evangelicals increased from 2016 to 2020.\n\nAnd what the men carrying wooden crosses among the Capitol mob couldn’t achieve on January 6, they might yet accomplish in 2024.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/28/trump-executive-orders-law-enforcement-sanctuary-cities/83324876007/", "title": "Trump signs executive orders bolstering law enforcement, immigration", "text": "One Trump order will 'unleash' law enforcement, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed two executive orders to bolster immigration enforcement and threaten jurisdictions that restrict cooperation with federal law enforcement with the loss of federal funding.\n\nThe orders collectively seek to bolster state and local law enforcement with better pay, cast-off military equipment and free legal support while also punishing so-called \"sanctuary\" states and cities with criminal investigations and the threatened loss of funding.\n\nThe signings April 28 come on the 99th day of Trump’s second term in office. His Republican administration is promoting tougher border enforcement as one of his central priorities, with what border czar Tom Homan called \"historic low\" border crossings.\n\n“It’s quite simple: obey the law, respect the law and don’t obstruct federal immigration officials and law enforcement officials when they are simply trying to remove public safety threats from the nation’s communities,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a morning White House briefing. “This administration is determined to enforce our immigration laws.”\n\nDOJ, DHS to highlight sanctuary cities: Leavitt\n\nThe first order aims to “strengthen and unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue and protect innocent citizens,” Leavitt said.\n\nThe order aims to increase the supply of excess military and national-security resources to state and local law enforcement. The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to provide legal resources for law enforcement officers who incur expenses from official duties, such as through free legal assistance from private lawyers.\n\nThe order also calls for an increase in pay and benefits for law enforcement officers, enhanced sentences for crimes against officers and greater investment in the size and security of prisons.\n\n“Safe communities rely on the backbone and heroism of a tough and well-equipped police force,” Trump’s order said. “My Administration is steadfastly committed to empowering State and local law enforcement to firmly police dangerous criminal behavior and protect innocent citizens.”\n\nThe second order calls on Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to publish a list of the communities nicknamed “sanctuary” jurisdictions that Leavitt said “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”\n\nTrump’s order calls for the government to withhold federal funding from them. The order also calls on Bondi and Noem to target the jurisdictions with potential criminal investigations. The alleged violations include obstruction of justice, unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal aliens, conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to impede federal law enforcement, according to the order.\n\n“Yet some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws,” the order said. “This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law and the Federal Government's obligation to defend the territorial sovereignty of the United States.”\n\nHoman to visit Rochester to support local police\n\nHoman said he would visit Rochester, New York, on April 29 to support local law enforcement officers after several were disciplined for aiding a Homeland Security official who called for emergency assistance.\n\n\"Cops need to help cops, especially in an emergency situation. But they got disciplined,\" Homan said. “I’m going up there to support the men and women of law enforcement.\"\n\nFocus on sanctuary cities arrives amid court battles\n\nThe administration’s conflict with sanctuary cities and states is being fought in court. Leavitt's announcement came after FBI agents arrested a local Wisconsin judge on April 18 for allegedly interfering with federal authorities trying to arrest an immigrant who didn’t have legal authorization to be in the country.\n\nMilwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was charged with alleged interference with a federal law enforcement operation and unlawful concealment of an individual subject to arrest.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials and others were trying to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican citizen previously removed from the U.S. and recently charged with multiple counts of domestic abuse-related battery. Dugan allegedly directed the federal authorities away from Flores-Ruiz after he appeared in her court.\n\nDugan had an initial appearance in court April 25 to be advised of her rights and her arraignment is scheduled May 15. Trump blasted the judge on April 27 as “terrible.”\n\nLawsuits challenge validity of sanctuary cities\n\nA group of 16 cities and counties filed a lawsuit against Trump’s policy withholding federal funding from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco blocked the policy on April 24 by ruling the government was unlawfully trying to force cooperation from jurisdictions such as Minneapolis, Portland, Santa Fe and Seattle.\n\nThe Trump administration isn’t always the defendant. Bondi sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County alleging they “obstruct” federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nBondi also sued New York state and its Department of Motor Vehicles for a “green-light” law that limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n“The American public doesn’t want illegal criminal aliens in their communities,” Leavitt said. “They made that quite clear on Nov. 5.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/08/chelsea-handler-lea-michele-more-celebrities-flee-homes-california-fires-rage/933923001/", "title": "California fires: Ellen DeGeneres, Kylie Jenner, more celebs affected", "text": "A number of celebrities are fleeing their homes as the blazing wildfires engulf Southern California.\n\nThe wind-driven wildfires have threatened more than 25,600 homes and forced evacuations of tens of thousands of residents.

It's been a terrible, terrible thing.”\n\nAsked about commutations he gave to leaders of the far-right groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, Trump said: “I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack and commuted sentences of 14 others, all members of either the far-right group Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.\n\nThat includes Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers, who had received the second-longest sentence of 18 years for his role in the riot.

We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" said principal White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields.\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMexican president says country will allow 'Remain in Mexico' policy\n\nMexico’s president suggested her country will let migrants wait for asylum hearings in Mexican territory after Donald Trump said he’d reinstate a program known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols.”\n\nOn Tuesday, President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo said Trump’s day-one declaration mimics his 2018 order, with which Mexico complied. The country allowed thousands of asylum-seekers to wait in cities along its northern border for immigration court hearings in the U.S.\n\n“We have our own migration policies,” she said during a news conference. “But we’re also a humanitarian government.”\n\nMexico will consider repatriating some foreign nationals, she said. The program, also called “Remain in Mexico,” was used during the first Trump administration to return nearly 70,000 people to Mexico to await court hearings, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nSheinbaum Pardo also noted that few migrants are reaching Mexico’s northern border with the U.S. as a result of Mexico’s own immigration enforcement.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\nTrump executive order restricts birthright citizenship; states sue\n\nDonald Trump issued an executive order Monday that will end automatic citizenship for children whose parents are foreign nationals, whether they're here legally or not.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of 18 states sued Trump and federal agencies in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, claiming the order violates the Constitution. The ACLU filed a separate legal challenge in New Hampshire on behalf of immigrant advocacy organizations on similar grounds.\n\nIt would, they said, upend a foundational aspect of the United States of America: that anyone born here is from here.\n\nThe executive order, called \"Protecting the Value and Meaning of American Citizenship, would prevent federal agencies from issuing Social Security cards, passports or welfare benefits to U.S.-born children in a sweeping reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\n\n– Lauren Villagran\n\n'I got to use it': Donald Trump's evolution from TikTok foe to a fan\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to \"save TikTok.\" But during the final months of his first term as president in 2020, he tried to shut down the wildly popular social media video app.\n\nIt marks a dramatic evolution as Trump begins his second term. His previous administration raised concerns about TikTok sharing personal data with the Chinese government.\n\nBut Trump is now shrugging off the same risks as he's getting hailed as TikTok's savior after seeing its benefits help him connect with young voters en route to winning back the White House.\n\n\"Because I got to use it,\" Trump told reporters Monday during a wide-ranging Oval Office media session when asked why he changed his mind about TikTok. \"And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. If China is going to get information about young kids, I don't know. To be honest with you, I think we have bigger problems than that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says he fired Biden appointees; chef Jose Andres says he resigned\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday said he plans to remove over 1,000 appointees from the administration of former President Joe Biden and that he had fired four individuals immediately, including celebrity chef Jose Andres and former top general Mark Milley.\n\nHowever, Andres said on social media that his two-year term on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition was already over. The Spanish chef, whose World Central Kitchen food aid program feeds people impacted by disasters, said he submitted his resignation last week.\n\n\"My Presidential Personnel Office is actively in the process of identifying and removing over a thousand Presidential Appointees from the previous Administration, who are not aligned with our vision to Make America Great Again,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social overnight.\n\n\"Let this serve as a notice of dismissal,\" Trump wrote and named Milley, Andres, his former Iran envoy Brian Hook and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who Biden appointed to an export council. \"YOU'RE FIRED!\", he wrote.\n\n– Reuters\n\nElise Stefanik and Democratic senator clash over Israel\n\nAt her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Elise Stefanik clashed with Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAsked by Van Hollen if she subscribed to Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich's view that Israel has a \"biblical right to the entire West Bank,\" Stefanik said she did.\n\n\"Peace and stability\" in the region would be \"very difficult to achieve...if you continue to hold the view that you just expressed,\" Van Hollen shot back.\n\nPressed by Van Hollen on whether she believes Palestinians have a right to self-determination, Stefanik responded \"I believe the Palestinian people deserve so much better than the failures that they've had.\"\n\nShe added, \"I want to ensure that, number one, we bring the hostages home.\"\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBishop directly asks Trump to have 'mercy' for LGBTQ children, immigrants unlawfully in US\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde directly addressed Donald Trump during a sermon on Tuesday, telling the president sitting in the audience at a prayer service at the National Cathedral \"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy on people in our country who are scared.\"\n\n\"There are gay, lesbian, transgender children in Democratic, Republican, independent families, some who fear for their lives,\" Budde said. She also reflected on working-class immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying: \"They may not be citizens or have proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals.\"\n\n\"I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here,\" said Budde, who has previously criticized the president.\n\nTrump during all three of his presidential campaigns called for mass deportations and other immigration crackdowns, often using dehumanizing language about immigrants.\n\nHe also often insulted transgender people on the campaign trail, and one of his first orders in office on Monday was that the federal government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, that are not changeable.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nElise Stefanik pushed on Elon Musk's gesture that drew online comparison to Nazi salute\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., pressed Elise Stefanik on a gesture Elon Musk made at a speech on Monday after Donald Trump's inauguration that drew accusations of being a Nazi salute. But Stefanik, who has said combatting antisemitism would be one of her main objectives as U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the gesture was nothing of the kind.\n\n\"No, Elon Musk did not do those salutes,\" she said. \"The American people are smart and they see through it. They support Elon Musk.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League later said the gesture was not a sieg heil, calling it an \"awkward\" move during a \"delicate moment\" in a statement met with some disagreement.\n\nMurphy read several comments from Christian nationalist and white supremacist groups, including the Proud Boys, praising Musk's gesture.\n\n\"I simply don't believe that if a member of the squad made that same gesture last night, that there wouldn't be commentary from you and others,\" he said, referring to the \"squad\" of Progressive Democratic congressmembers.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nElise Stefanik calls UN resolutions aimed at Israel 'antisemitic rot'\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, promised at her confirmation hearing to \"stand with Israel\" and called United Nations resolutions aimed at Israel are \"antisemitic rot.\"\n\n\"I was interested in this position because, if you look at the antisemitic rot within the UN, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The UN has accused Israel of \"extermination\" and possible war crimes in Gaza.\n\nStefanik also touted that she voted to defund UNRWA, the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians. The agency was the largest humanitarian organization still working in Gaza, until its operational ability in the enclave was hit when Israel banned it in October after around a dozen of its members were found to be on Hamas' payroll or involved in its Oct. 7 attack.\n\nShe praised then-U.S. ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan for opposing a UN resolution passed 50 years ago that classified Zionism as \"a form of racism and racial discrimination\" and said she would hope to embody \"that type of leadership\" in the position.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat's on Trump's schedule today?\n\nTrump is attending a service of prayer for the nation on Tuesday at Washington's National Cathedral, joined by Vice President JD Vance and other dignitaries.\n\nAfterward, he'll meet with congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, before delivering remarks on American infrastructure.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump, Vance attend national prayer service in Washington\n\nDonald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are attending a prayer service at the National Cathedral, alongside their spouses, first lady Melania Trump and second lady Usha Vance.\n\nThe cathedral calls the gathering a \"service for the nation, not any politician or political party.\"\n\n\"This service was designed to pray for unity, reconciliation and bridge-building in our divided nation,\" the cathedral says on its website.\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde is preaching at the service, but it will also feature worship rooted in Jewish, Muslim and other faith traditions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the second lady\n\nUsha Vance, 38, is the nation's new second lady, but she's been out of the spotlight more than the first couple or her husband, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nChilukuri, 38, was born and raised in San Diego as a child of Hindu Indian immigrants. She met her husband at Yale Law School when they were assigned as partners for their first major writing assignment.\n\nBefore Usha Vance hit the campaign trail with her husband, she worked at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm that specializes in litigation, corporate, professional liability, employment, financial restructuring, tax and executive compensation. She left the firm when JD Vance secured the vice-presidential nomination.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nTrump's Treasury pick clears critical hurdle\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday gave their stamp of approval to Scott Bessent, Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department.\n\nTwo Democrats, Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, joined their Republican colleagues in voting for Bessent.\n\nIf Bessent is confirmed by the entire Senate, he'll be the first openly gay Treasury secretary in U.S. history, as well as the highest-ranking LGBTQ official.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nThe world's richest people attended Trump's inauguration. Here are their net worths\n\nSome of the richest people in the world were among the guests invited to witness President Donald Trump take the oath of office for the second time on Monday.\n\nAs some of Trump's top allies, the tech billionaires were given VIP seating next to top U.S. officials and his family for the swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol rotunda. Seated in front of Trump's incoming Cabinet were Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.\n\nTheir presence in Trump's orbit underscores not only the incoming administration's pro-business agenda, but the likely influence the world's wealthiest tech leaders could have on U.S. policy.\n\nRead more: Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg attended Trump's inauguration: What are their net worths?\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nTrump talks Greenland, tariffs in Oval Office press conference\n\nDonald Trump turned an executive order signing ceremony into an impromptu press conference Monday, answering dozens of questions from reporters.\n\nTrump talked about imposing 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, mulled sending military special forces into Mexico to fight drug cartels, and said he’s not confident a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas will hold. He also reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark.\n\nThe press conference came after a long day of events that saw Trump sworn into office at the U.S. Capitol, where his inauguration ceremony was moved because of frigid temperatures.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nElise Stefanik to face questions at UN ambassador confirmation hearing\n\nElise Stefanik, Donald Trump's pick as the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, will face senators on Tuesday morning at her confirmation hearing begins.\n\nStefanik, a Republican lawmaker from New York and top Trump ally, has served five terms in Congress. Her close relationship with Trump briefly stirred speculation that he was considering her for vice president.\n\nStefanik garnered praise in conservative circles for now-viral questions she posed to the heads of three Ivy League schools at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism, as protests against Israel's actions in Gaza rocked colleges nationwide.\n\nAfter Stefanik asked the three presidents – of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania–- whether calling for the genocide of Jews called for disciplinary action, they waffled and gave indirect answers. Two of the three later resigned.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden leaves letter for Trump\n\nDonald Trump discovered a personal letter Monday in the Oval Office from former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe letter-writing tradition from outgoing to incoming presidents dates back to 1989 when Ronald Reagan left a brief letter for George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump declined to reveal the contents of Biden’s letter Monday.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nStewart Rhodes, former Oath Keepers leader, free after Trump pardon\n\nPeople convicted in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, began to be released from prison overnight after President Donald Trump approved pardons Monday for nearly 1,600 people charged in the riot.\n\nTrump commuted the sentences for 14 defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers militia who received the second-longest sentence of 18 years. Rhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, early Tuesday.\n\nRelatives of Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy, said they expected his release on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Rhodes nor Tarrio entered the Capitol, but they were convicted of seditious conspiracy for helping plan the attack.\n\n--Bart Jansen and Reuters\n\nTrump pardons nearly 1,600 people charged in Jan. 6 attack on U.S. Capitol\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned nearly all the 1,600 people charged in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021, fulfilling a campaign pledge critics said would \"endorse attacks on democracy.\"\n\nThe total includes hundreds of people convicted of felonies for attacking police and temporarily interrupting Congress from certifying the 2020 election victory of former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"These are the hostages,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"Full pardon. This is a big one. We hope they come out tonight.”\n\nAbout 1,270 have been convicted and 1,100 have been sentenced in the riot, according to the Justice Department. About 600 people were charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe list of those receiving clemency included 14 people receiving commutations to end their sentences, including top members of two militia groups, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Stewart Rhodes, who was leader of the Oath Keepers, had been sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"We're excited about it,\" Ed Tarpley, a Rhodes lawyer, told USA TODAY. “This is an answered prayer and we're all very happy.\"\n\nNayib Hassan, a lawyer for Enrique Tarrio, who received the longest sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy as a leader of the far-right Proud Boys gang, said he wasn't sure if Tarrio got a pardon or commutation.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nCarrie Underwood sang 'America the Beautiful' after technical difficulties\n\nCountry music star Carrie Underwood took the stage during Trump's inauguration to sing \"America the Beautiful,\" but she paused as there appeared to be a technical glitch. She proceeded to sing the song without instrumentation before shaking Trump's hand.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat balls did President Trump and Melania Trump attend?\n\nPresident Trump sported a tuxedo and bowtie and first lady Melania Trump wore a black and white dress as they concluded Inauguration Day at a trio of balls in downtown Washington, D.C.\n\nJust before 10:30 p.m. Monday, the first couple shared their first dance to an Elvis-style rendition of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at the Commander in Chief Ball. Vice President JD Vance, also in a tuxedo, and second lady Usha Vance, in a sparkly blue dress, joined the president and first lady for a spin on stage.\n\nTrump later made an appearance at the Liberty Ball and ended his night at the Starlight Ball at Union Station. In one of his final dances of the evening, the president took to the floor alongside his family members and the Vances to Frank Sinatra’s “I Did It My Way.”\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nWhat executive orders did Trump sign on Monday?\n\nPresident Trump began signing his first wave of executive orders around 7 p.m. Monday, after his swearing-in ceremony and a parade, and just before the evening's inaugural balls that stretched well past midnight.\n\nHe started by rescinding 78 executive orders approved by his predecessor Joe Biden, including efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and reduce the cost of prescription medications.\n\nTrump also declared a national border emergency and ordered the U.S. armed forces to repel \"forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking. The new president's moves also include halting enforcement of a ban on TikTok in the U.S. for 75 days, mandating how the U.S. government recognizes gender on federal documents, and changing the official names of Mount Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n- Laura Villagran and Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Trump say during his inauguration speech?\n\nTrump said during his inauguration ceremony in the Capitol rotunda that he believes \"a tide of change is sweeping the country.\"\n\n\"I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,\" he said.\n\nBut the president also laid out a list of conservative priorities and campaign promises, including declaring an emergency on the southern border, rolling back climate change priorities and more. He also hit Panama's management of the Panama Canal and vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn swearing-in ceremony, President Trump's hand wasn't on his Bible. Does it matter?\n\nDonald Trump had his left hand down at his side – and not on one of the two Bibles his wife Melania held up for him – during his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nDoes it matter? Not according to the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the incoming president must swear an oath of office, saying: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nBut the Constitution also protects religious freedom and holds that \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\"\n\n− Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/florida-red-flag-law", "title": "Florida's red flag law, championed by Republicans, is taking guns ...", "text": "Tampa, Florida CNN —\n\nTwice a week from her courtroom, Florida 13th Circuit Court Judge Denise Pomponio decides who in Hillsborough County can no longer be trusted with a gun.\n\nIn just the last two months, she has taken away the firearm privileges of dozens of people, including a dad accused of threatening to “shoot everyone” at his son’s school, a woman who police say attempted suicide and then accidentally shot her boyfriend during a struggle for her revolver, a husband who allegedly fired multiple rounds in the street to “blow off steam” after losing a family member, a bullied 13-year-old witnesses overheard saying, “If all of 8th grade is missing tomorrow you will know why,” and a mother arrested for brandishing a handgun at another mom after a school bus incident between their daughters.\n\nThis is Florida’s “red flag” law in action. Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/09/politics/jan-6-hearing-cheney-trump-overturn-election-plan", "title": "Liz Cheney said Trump had a 'seven-part plan' to overturn the ...", "text": "1.

More than 900,000 Florida residents have tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, since the pandemic started.\n\nVisit Florida President and CEO Dana Young called the third-quarter numbers encouraging.\n\n“Although out-of-state visitation was down again in the third quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are encouraged to see some signs of recovery in our visitation estimates, particularly with international travel almost nonexistent,” Young said in a prepared statement. “These positive trends coincide with Visit Florida’s recently launched marketing campaigns that highlight all of the safe vacation opportunities that Florida currently has to offer. While we still have a long way to go, Visit Florida will continue our efforts to expedite tourism’s recovery from the pandemic so Floridians can get back to work.”\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic could stretch across years, even if vaccines start to become available in the coming months. Hotels continue to announce cutbacks, and the cruise industry is expecting a slow return to the seas next year.\n\nMayor defends stance: Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson defends his stance on COVID-19 as numbers increase\n\nWhile Gov. Ron DeSantis fully reopened the state at the end of September, the third quarter got underway with restaurants operating at a maximum of 50 percent indoor occupancy. Movie theaters, tattoo shops and major theme parks also had recently been given the go-ahead to reopen in most of the state.\n\nSeaWorld and Universal Orlando opened their Florida parks in June, with Walt Disney properties following in mid-July. All imposed limits on attendance and imposed new health-related requirements.\n\nAll reported lower-than-expected crowds and later announced additional layoffs. However, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said last week that the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios were increasing capacity from 25 percent to 35 percent.\n\nFor many bars and craft breweries, the third quarter was mostly a dark period.\n\nThose businesses had been allowed to reopen in early June as part of the second phase of DeSantis’ economic plan. But after widespread non-compliance with COVID-19 restrictions, bars and breweries that didn’t serve food were effectively closed again throughout July and August. That was lifted in mid-September.\n\nThe reopening of bars came as Visit Florida rolled out the first part of a $13 million campaign to revive tourism, urging Floridians to travel to other parts of the state. The advertising campaign has since been expanded to East Coast cities considered within short drives or flights to Florida.\n\nThe third-quarter figures primarily reflect people trekking to Florida from other parts of the country, according to Visit Florida.\n\nIn-state travel numbers aren’t reflected in the tourism figures. And visitor numbers from Canada and overseas are well off the 2019 marks.\n\nIn 2019, Florida recorded 32.412 million visitors in the third quarter and 100.61 million for the first nine months of the year. So far this year, the state’s overall tourism numbers are down 34 percent.\n\nAmong the 2020 third-quarter numbers, Florida saw just 229,000 overseas visitors and 6,000 Canadians, both down slightly from the second quarter, when there were 235,000 overseas visitors and 9,000 Canadians.\n\nThe state, which had been on a nine-year run of increasing tourist numbers, estimated nearly 2.65 million overseas visitors in the second and third quarters of 2019 and 1.433 million Canadians over those six months.\n\nFlorida ended 2019 with 131.4 million visitors. Barring an uptick in fourth-quarter travel, the state is on pace for 88.5 million visitors this year, which would be the lowest since the post-recession year of 2011.\n\nThursday’s release came as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated COVID-19 recommendations to advise against traveling to visit family and friends during the Thanksgiving holiday period.\n\nThe CDC guidance proposed a Thanksgiving in which people would celebrate with others who live in their households.\n\nOn its website, the CDC suggested “hosting a virtual meal with friends and family who don’t live with you. Have people share recipes and show off their turkey, dressing, and other dishes.”\n\nThe AAA auto club has projected 2.76 million Floridians will travel a substantial distance for Thanksgiving, down from 2.91 million a year ago.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/health/phage-superbug-killer-life-itself-wellness", "title": "No antibiotics worked, so this woman turned to a natural enemy of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.\n\nAfter months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.\n\n“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’\n\n“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”\n\nStrathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nWhat she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.\n\nThen she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.\n\nNext, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.\n\nYet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.\n\nTheir story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.\n\n“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28 - Source: CNN How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28\n\nA terrifying vacation\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.\n\nFound in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”\n\n“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”\n\nToday, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.\n\n“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”\n\nWith the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”\n\nPatterson's body was systemically infected with a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that also infected troops in the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname \"Iraqibacter.\" Steffanie Strathdee\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack\n\nAfter that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nA phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.\n\n“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”\n\nBuoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.\n\nOne stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.\n\n“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”\n\n‘No problem’\n\nWhile the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.\n\nBut the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”\n\nIn fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.\n\nDr. Robert \"Chip\" Schooley (left) and Dr. Randy Taplitz after injecting Patterson with the first round of phages at UC San Diego Medical Center. Carly DeMento\n\nBack in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.\n\n“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”\n\nPurifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”\n\nMore hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.\n\n“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.\n\n“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”\n\n‘It was just miraculous’\n\nThe purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.\n\n“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”\n\nTwo days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.\n\n“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\n“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”\n\nPatterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nDamaged but not broken\n\nToday, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.\n\n“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.\n\n“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”\n\nTo prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.\n\n“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.\n\n“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”\n\nA legacy\n\n\"The Perfect Predator\" is a blow-by-blow account by the couple of the fight to save Patterson's life. Hachette Books\n\nPatterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.\n\n“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\nSome of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.\n\n“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.\n\nIn San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.\n\nSchooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.\n\nAnd a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19 - Source: CNN How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19\n\n“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”\n\nStrathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.\n\n“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’\n\n“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/21/ivf-pregnancy-cost-medical-tourism/75735952007/", "title": "IVF medical tourism is gaining traction thanks to TikTok", "text": "After three years of trying and a miscarriage, Amanda Lacommare was desperate to become a mom.\n\nShe and her husband Leonardo had first sought treatment in their home state of Florida. At an Orlando clinic, she underwent three rounds of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and two cycles of IVF with no success, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in medical debt. The tremendous cost and continuous defeat were nearly enough for them to give up.\n\nThen, a viral TikTok landed on Lacommare's \"For You Page,\" where one woman shared her story of doing IVF overseas. She discovered the Barbados Fertility Clinic and after extensive research, found only positive reviews. The couple never planned to go abroad in their journey to become parents, but they decided to take a risk, and finally found success, welcoming their son Mateo in 2023.\n\nThe total cost for two trips to Barbados, including the procedures, flights, hotels, groceries and other living expenses, was approximately $30,000 — half the price of just two rounds of IVF at home in Orlando.\n\nMedical tourism is not new, but as of late, the dissemination of success stories on social media is inspiring couples like the Laccomares to take a step they'd never have otherwise considered.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the young lady who spoke about her situation,\" Lacommare says. \"If I had never downloaded TikTok, I would have never found out to go (to Barbados), and I wouldn't have a baby now.\"\n\nWhat is medical tourism?\n\nMedical tourism is traveling to another country to get medical care. According to the CDC, millions of U.S. residents partake in medical tourism each year, most commonly venturing to Mexico or Canada, as well as Central America, South America and the Caribbean.\n\nMedical tourism can be used to get cheaper medical care, receive care that shares the patient's language and culture, or obtain a procedure or therapy that is unavailable or unapproved in the US. However, the CDC cautions that this can be risky, as air travel and communication challenges can cause complications, and you are more likely to get an antibiotic-resistant infection in some countries.\n\nIn 2022, three Americans became infected by mycobacterium abscessus, a distant relative of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy, after obtaining stem cell treatments in Mexico. The procedure is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the incident raised concerns about receiving medical care abroad.\n\nYet, Lacommare says, even with some inherent risk, it was the right move for her. \"It's half the cost, and we went on vacation twice.\"\n\nTheir trip to Barbados came with new tests\n\nAfter Lacommare's initial outreach to the Barbados Fertility Centre, she had a free phone consultation with a doctor who suggested she had high natural killer cells, which was causing her body to reject her husband's sperm.\n\nLacommare had not heard of this before, but flew to Chicago to have specialized blood work done, which confirmed the doctor's suspicion. The doctor recommended suppressing Lacommare's immune system to improve her chances of carrying a baby.\n\n\"(The doctor in Barbados) thought out of the box. She cared to look through all the documents we sent her from both doctors,\" Lacommare says.\n\nAt 40, Lacommare ended up receiving an egg donation from her sister. After two cycles of IVF at Barbados Fertility Centre, the Lacommares finally welcomed their son, Mateo, in 2023.\n\nHer care was comprehensive and cheaper\n\nLacommare feels the care in Barbados was more comprehensive and personalized than back home in the U.S. \"My fear was going out of the country, and I wish I was never afraid to go out of the country,\" she says.\n\nIn Barbados, she was offered acupuncture before and after embryo transfers, Reiki and stress management practices. Her visits were longer, allowing her to take more time with the doctors to ask questions and go over her care.\n\nLacommare hopes by sharing her story, she can empower others, as long as they too take the proper precautions: \"Do your research,\" she says. \"We came back with a baby.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/06/26/jd-vance-meme-norwegian-tourist-denied-entry-us-phone-search-ohio/84369477007/", "title": "Tourist says JD Vance meme kept him out of US.

The biggest public crowds seen were outside of pharmacies and Covid-19 testing booths.\n\nMedia outlet China Youth Daily documented hours-long lines at a clinic in central Beijing on Friday, and cited unnamed experts calling for residents not to visit hospitals unless necessary.\n\nHealth workers in the capital were also grappling with a surge in emergency calls, including from many Covid-positive residents with mild or no symptoms. A hospital official on Saturday appealed to residents in such cases not to call the city’s 911-like emergency services hotline to keep it free for the seriously ill.\n\nThe daily volume of emergency calls had surged from its usual 5,000 to more than 30,000 in recent days, Chen Zhi, chief physician of the Beijing Emergency Center said, according to official media.\n\nCovid was “spreading rapidly” driven by highly transmissible Omicron variants in China, a top Covid-19 expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in an interview published by state media Saturday.\n\n“No matter how strong the prevention and control is, it will be difficult to completely cut off the transmission chain,” Zhong, who has been a key public voice since the earliest days of the pandemic in 2020, was quoted saying by Xinhua.\n\nChanges, and concerns\n\nThe rapid rollback of testing nationwide and the shift by many people to use antigen tests at home has also made it difficult to gauge the extent of the spread, with official data now appearing meaningless.\n\nAuthorities recorded 8,626 Covid-19 cases across China on Sunday, down from the previous day’s count of 10,597 and from the high of more than 40,000 daily cases late last month. CNN reporting from Beijing indicates the case count in the Chinese capital could be much higher than recorded.\n\nOne note seen on a residential building in Beijing is indicative of the larger situation, reading: “Due to the severe epidemic situation in recent days, the number of employees who can come to work is seriously insufficient, and the normal operation of the apartment has been greatly affected and challenged.”\n\nPosters used for health code scanning and barriers used for health screening are seen dismantled at Nanjing South railway station on Friday in Nanjing, China. Yifan Ding/Getty Images\n\nThe country is only days out from a major relaxation of its longstanding zero-Covid measures, which came as a head-spinning change for many Chinese living under the government’s stringent controls and fed a longstanding narrative about the deadliness of Covid-19.\n\nLast Wednesday, top health officials made a sweeping rollback of the mass testing, centralized quarantine, and health code tracking rules that it had relied on to control viral spread. Some aspects of those measures, such as health code use in designated places and central quarantine of severe cases, as well as home isolation of cases, remain.\n\nOutside experts have warned that China may be underprepared to handle the expected surge of cases, after the surprise move to lift its measures in the wake of nationwide protests against the policy, growing case numbers and rising economic costs.\n\nWhile Omicron may cause relatively milder disease compared to earlier variants, even a small number of serious cases could have a significant impact on the health system in a country of 1.4 billion.\n\nZhong, in the state media interview, said the government’s top priority now should be booster shots, particularly for the elderly and others most at risk, especially with Lunar New Year coming up next month – a peak travel time where urban residents visit elderly relatives and return to rural hometowns.\n\nHealth authorities on Sunday ordered improvements in medical capabilities in rural areas by the end of the month.\n\nMeasures to be undertaken include increasing ICU wards and beds, enhancing medical staff for intensive care and setting up more clinics for fevers, China’s National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\n‘Over-hyping’\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned a lack of experience with the virus – and years of state media coverage focusing on its dangers and impact overseas, before a recent shift in tone – could push those who are not in critical need to seek medical care, further overwhelming systems.\n\nBob Li, a graduate student in Beijing, who tested positive on Friday said he wasn’t afraid of the virus, but his mother, who lives in the countryside, stayed up all night worrying about him. “She finds the virus a very, very scary thing,” Li said.\n\n“I think most people in rural China may have some misunderstandings about the virus, which may come from the overhyping of this virus by the state in the past two years. This is one of the reasons why people are so afraid,” he said, adding that he still supports the government’s careful treatment of Covid-19 during the pandemic.\n\nThere are clear efforts to tamp down on public concern about Covid-19 – and its knock-on effects, like panic buying of medications.\n\nChina’s market watchdog said on Friday that there was a “temporary shortage” of some “hot-selling” drugs and vowed to crack down on price gouging, while major online retailer JD.com last week said it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies after sales for certain medications surged 18 times that week over the same period in October.\n\nA hashtag trending on China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo over the weekend featured a state media interview with a Beijing doctor saying people who tested positive for Covid-19 but had no or mild symptoms did not need to take medication to recover.\n\n“People with asymptomatic infections do not need medication at all. It is enough to rest at home, maintain a good mood and physical condition,” Li Tongzeng, chief infectious disease physician at Beijing You An Hospital, said in an interview linked to a hashtag viewed more than 370 million times since Friday.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Selina Wang Wayne Chang", "Simone Mccarthy", "Selina Wang", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/business/olympic-sponsors-beijing-games-mic-intl-hnk", "title": "Olympic sponsors paid big money for the Beijing Games.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong/Tokyo CNN Business —\n\nSponsors of the Olympics are walking a tightrope ahead of the Beijing Winter Games next month as worsening geopolitical tensions force them to consider downplaying their involvement without upsetting China.\n\nPolitical fervor in the United States reached a high last month as the White House called for a diplomatic boycott of the Games, a statement against human rights abuses that Washington has accused Beijing of perpetuating in the country’s western Xinjiang region.\n\nThat’s added to pressure on companies such as Coca-Cola (KO), Intel (INTC), Visa (V) and Airbnb, which in recent months have faced calls to cut ties with the event because of Xinjiang.\n\nSome politicians have accused businesses of undermining the ability of their home countries to send a clear message to Beijing through diplomatic boycotts. Critics also question the value of sponsoring an event that won’t be selling tickets to the public due to pandemic curbs.\n\nBut corporate executives have few good options as they are pulled between the world’s two largest economies. Stay silent, and risk alienating consumers in places like the US. Pull back, and potentially damage their prospects in the vast Chinese market.\n\nInternational companies are familiar with the risks. Last year, Nike (NKE), H&M (HNNMY) and other Western brands faced a boycott in China because of a stand they took against the alleged use of forced labor in Xinjiang. And in 2019, comments made by the Houston Rockets’ then-general manager in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong threatened billions of dollars in business between the NBA and China.\n\nThe sensitivities leave companies treading on thin ice, according to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester (FORR) in charge of brand strategy.\n\nHe described the upcoming Games as “an upside-down Olympics.”\n\n“This is a very, very unusual year,” Chatterjee told CNN Business. “Typically at this time of the year, you know, all the brands are all agog with excitement because the Olympics is right around the corner … Instead, what you’ve found is that they’ve retreated into their shells.”\n\nPeople in personal protective kits walking past a Winter Olympics display on Wednesday in Beijing. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nMark DiMassimo, the founder and creative chief of DiGo, an advertising agency in New York, said sponsors appear to be downplaying their involvement, at least in the lead-up to the Games.\n\n“You don’t see the typical promotion of their Olympics advertising in advance. You’d be typically seeing it at this time, and we’re not,” he said. “I think they’re trying not to make themselves the story.”\n\nRising tension\n\nThe US was soon joined in its diplomatic boycott by the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Denmark, which each announced they would not be sending any government delegations to the events, citing human rights concerns in China. Japan and the Netherlands have also said their senior officials will not attend, though they have not described their actions as a boycott.\n\nChina, for its part, has called on the international community to “depoliticize” sports and warned that countries could “pay the price for their mistaken acts.” The Chinese government has also repeatedly and vehemently denied all allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nBut for businesses, the diplomatic firestorm set off a gigantic scramble, according to DiMassimo.\n\nThere were “lots of late-night Zoom calls and meetings as advertisers tried to figure out what to do,” he said, referring to the aftermath of the US boycott.\n\nA worker cleaning a section of the Olympic Green in front of the Beijing Olympic Tower on Wednesday. Jae C. Hong/AP\n\nEven before then, pressure was rising. Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch, said her team wrote an open letter to Coca-Cola last May, asking if it had conducted a human rights review in China in light of its participation in the Games.\n\nCoke did not respond, which was “disappointing,” Richardson said, arguing that the company was demonstrating “double standards.”\n\n“It will defend voting rights, for example, in the United States, where it’s relatively easy and cost-free, and presumably in their calculations, maybe makes them look even better,” she added, referring to Coca-Cola’s intervention after a controversial voting law in Georgia was passed last year.\n\n“But they won’t talk about the total lack of voting rights inside a place like China.”\n\nAsked about the matter by US Sen. Tom Cotton last year, an executive said that Georgia was the company’s home state, “where many of our employees live and work.”\n\n“We are most engaged on policy issues here at home, but we are clear in our respect for human rights globally,” said Paul Lalli, Coca-Cola’s global vice president of human rights.\n\nTreading carefully\n\nExperts say the Olympics’ top partners collectively pay billions of dollars to sponsor the Games, including fees paid to organizers and additional marketing costs.\n\nBut analysts suspect their advertising push this year might be a lot more muted than that number would merit.\n\n“There is speculation that a whole bunch of these brands that have bought premium ad spots for the Olympics are going to run generic messaging,” Chatterjee said, referring to standard advertisements that were not created specifically for the event.\n\n“I mean, that is mind-boggling, right?” Chatterjee added.\n\n“They have paid a premium, they have paid top dollar to be associated with this incredible equity of the Olympics,” he said, suggesting they’d have to “backtrack” to avoid controversy.\n\nNot everyone sees it that way.\n\nWhat you’ve found is that they’ve retreated into their shells. Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president at Forrester, on the atmosphere for brands around the Olympics this year\n\nRob Prazmark, who runs the firm 21 Marketing and helped create the International Olympic Committee’s global partnership program nearly 40 years ago, said he had a hard time believing that sponsors would “end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars” and not “use the Olympic brand.”\n\n“The research still says it has so much equity, and pull at the heart, not just here in the States, but in China, in Japan, in Korea, in France,” he said. “The companies realize that the upside potential is greater than the downside risk.”\n\nTo be sure, sponsors aren’t holding back within mainland China.\n\nOver the last several weeks, brands have seized the opportunity to connect with consumers on the ground, with Coca-Cola, Visa and Procter & Gamble (PG) all rolling out promotional campaigns.\n\nCNN Business reached out to all 14 top Olympic partners for comment. Most did not respond, while Intel and China’s Mengniu Dairy declined to comment.\n\nAtos (AEXAY), a French IT company, said it would “not comment on issues outside of our role as worldwide IT partner,” and fully abides “by the IOC’s strategy on human rights, in addition to our own ethics and compliance program.”\n\nCoca-Cola said its top executives wouldn’t be at the Games due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a scheduling conflict with its upcoming earnings, without commenting further.\n\nAllianz (ALIZF), a German insurer, said that it was focused on the achievements of the athletes, while Swiss watchmaker Omega said that it planned to concentrate on “ensuring that each result is measured with utmost precision.”\n\nAddressing the issue\n\nSome companies, however, have tried to address the elephant in the room.\n\nLast July, a US congressional commission summoned American companies to a hearing to address their commitment to human rights in China and the risks of being associated with the Games.\n\nExecutives from Airbnb, Coca-Cola, Intel, P&G and Visa testified, each noting that they were long-term partners with the IOC and not focused on any particular set of Games.\n\n“We do not believe our sponsorship degrades our global commitment to human rights,” said Steve Rodgers, Intel’s general counsel.\n\n“Our sponsorship is not an endorsement of any specific host country or its government, nor an acceptance or approval of domestic activities that may take place within that country.”\n\nSome companies have even met with activists.\n\nLast October, Allianz spent time with campaigners from the World Uyghur Congress, according to Zumretay Arkin, the group’s program manager. The organization says it represents the interests of the Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in Xinjiang that the United States and others allege is a victim of China’s human rights violations.\n\nArkin said the organization, along with a Tibetan human rights group, had reached out to all Beijing Olympic sponsors, and found that “Allianz was the only company willing to meet with us.”\n\nAn activist protesting outside an Allianz office in Berlin, Germany. Christophe Gateau/picture-allian/dpa/AP\n\nDuring the meeting, a former Uyghur teacher in detention camps and a former Tibetan political prisoner shared their past experiences with Allianz representatives, according to Arkin.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Allianz said that “we consider dialogue with civil society organizations to be very important.”\n\n“We have been in exchange with [such organizations] on our sponsorship in recent months and know their expectations towards sponsors,” the company added, without elaborating further.\n\nThe big picture\n\nStill, there is broad recognition that this isn’t likely to be the first or last controversy with the Olympics.\n\nObservers point to the Berlin Games in 1936, Moscow in 1980, Salt Lake City in 2002, and even Beijing in 2008 as also having been highly politicized.\n\nCompanies “know that if they’re going to be a sponsor of the Olympics, that there are going to be protests and boycotts. It happens just about with every Games,” said Rick Burton, a sports management professor at Syracuse University, who was chief marketing officer for the US Olympic Committee for the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\n“I think they take the stance that they’ve got to operate regardless,” he added.\n\nBrands also typically lock themselves into deals that can stretch out over a decade, according to Prazmark.\n\nThe companies realize that the upside potential is greater than the downside risk. Rob Prazmark, CEO of 21 Marketing who helped create the IOC's global partnership program in 1985\n\n“Some of these companies have contracts now through 2032, some 2028,” he said. “And so they kind of flow with the tide, meaning there are some Games that are great, some Games that are not that great, but they realize they’re in it for the long haul.”\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau, Emiko Jozuka and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Selina Wang", "Michelle Toh", "Selina Wang"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/entertainment/wednesday-dance-tiktok-popularity-cec", "title": "'Wednesday' dance takes on a life of its own | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWednesday Addams doesn’t do anything by accident. The most stoic and deliberate member of the Addams Family, she rarely makes unnecessary movements, smiles and blinks included.\n\nSo when the spirit of dance possessed the typically morose teen at her school dance in the new Netflix series bearing her name, it caused an immediate stir, onscreen and off.\n\nThe brief scene makes up less than three minutes of the entire series, but it’s quickly become “Wednesday’s” most iconic moment for how free our kooky protagonist appears to feel. Her eyes betray a rare, ghoulish passion. Her limbs, typically glued to her side, are flung about freely. The dance is her, to be sure – lots of severe, stilted movements and cues from decades past. Certainly no one could mistake Wednesday’s dance for the latest TikTok trend, right?\n\nSomething about that peculiar dance unlocked something weird within all of us, and it’s taken off quicker than a fire at Camp Chippewa. Clips of the choreography inspired viewers to check out the series, making it one of the streamer’s most-watched shows ever (“Stranger Things,” who?). Its online popularity rocketed Lady Gaga’s “Bloody Mary” back onto charts more than a decade after the song’s release, and it was only featured in fan-made TikToks, not the show itself! “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega’s admission that she choreographed the routine herself invited new fans – celebrities included – to give it a whirl and even infuse the routine with moves from their own cultures.\n\nWednesday Addams would likely be mortified if she knew her moves had become, shudder, mainstream, but her dance just won’t die – and that, she just might enjoy. Here’s what lends the “Wednesday” dance its supernatural staying power.\n\nThe scene has its own mythos\n\nThe “Wednesday” dance scene only debuted a month ago, but it has a certain “mythology” to it already, said Jenna Drenten, associate professor of marketing at Loyola University Chicago who studies how users of TikTok and other digital platforms express their identities.\n\nMost of the scene’s lore was developed offscreen. Ortega, playing a teenaged Wednesday with her pitch-black humor in tact, has said she choreographed the routine herself. She counted among her influences Bob Fosse, Siouxsie Sioux and ’80s goth dance clubs (she also likely sneaked in some references to “The Addams Family” TV series from the ’60s).\n\nThe Cramps soundtracked Wednesday's dance in her titular Netflix series. Peter Noble/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s more, Ortega has admitted that she’s not a trained dancer, making her routine perhaps even more inviting to non-dancers who found the routine on TikTok, Drenten said.\n\n“I’m not a dancer and I’m sure that’s obvious,” Ortega told NME.\n\nBut Ortega’s dedication has inspired outrage, too – she told NME she filmed some of the dance while waiting on Covid-19 test results, which later came back positive. This prompted some to condemn the production for failing to follow proper Covid-19 prevention protocols on set – but still, “Wednesday” continued to make waves.\n\nThe viral trends that remain in the cultural conversation the longest typically don’t remain only on their platform of origin, Drenten said. Look at the Corn Kid: He appeared in a YouTube series singing the praises of the cob, then clips of his appearance went viral on TikTok and he’s since gone on to work with Chipotle, Green Giant and the state of South Dakota, promoting corn offline.\n\n“To have a longer shelf life, TikTok trends have to make that leap to a cultural trend, beyond the borders of TikTok,” she said. “The ‘Wednesday’ dance had an advantage in this sense because the dance and ‘The Addams Family’ legacy originated outside of TikTok from the start.”\n\nThe ‘Wednesday’ dance has become a shared ritual\n\nAnother thing the “Wednesday” dance has on its side – the human tendency to learn a dance for social currency.\n\nThink of the “Electric Slide,” “Macarena,” “Cupid Shuffle” – standards at bat mitzvahs and weddings, moves many of us know so well we can perform them without thinking. Performing them en masse at an event like that might feel like a Pavlovian response to a DJ’s song choice, but it’s also a shared ritual that fosters “a sense of solidarity and belonging,” Drenten said.\n\n“Every gesture and movement enables the person performing it to inherently say, ‘I get it, I’m in the know, we have this shared experience,’” Drenten said.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why dance routines, from “Renegade” to Lizzo’s “About Damn Time,” so often dominate TikTok. But unlike those trends, the “Wednesday” dance wasn’t set to a popular song, although The Cramps’ punk anthem “Goo Goo Muck” has since earned some new fans. The moves were easy enough to pick up, Drenten said, “straightforward but unique.”\n\nLady Gaga put her own spin on the now-iconic \"Wednesday\" dance, braids and all. From @ladygaga/TikTok\n\nBut it took Lady Gaga to take the “Wednesday” dance stratospheric. The version that’s gone über-viral on TikTok is a “fancam” of sorts, or a mashup of clips, set fittingly to Gaga’s “Bloody Mary,” a Biblical ode to dancing uninhibitedly. Even Mother Monster herself performed a version of the “Wednesday” dance, wearing two long braids.\n\nMillions of users have since put their own spin on Wednesday’s school dance solo, with some users incorporating Polynesian or Indian dance styles in their versions or making their own Wednesday looks (Thing, the disembodied hand, included!).\n\nWednesday gives us permission to be weirdos\n\nBelonging, of course, is antithetical to the ethos of Wednesday, who’s never cared for fitting in. She’s perfectly content on an island of her own, where the sun never shines and old-timey torture tools are abundant. That Wednesday’s idiosyncratic moves have been copied so widely could threaten to diminish her status as a patron saint of weirdos – except that Wednesday’s style and attitude have been copied for decades.\n\nWednesday Addams has existed in some form since the late 1930s – first as an unnamed comic character, then as a diminutive child on a TV sitcom, then, in her most famous iteration before “Wednesday” premiered, as a dead-eyed Christina Ricci. And fans of Wednesday have been dressing up like her for decades, Drenten said, often inspired by Ricci’s portrayal. The eldest Addams child is no longer a secret her biggest fans can keep from mainstream pop culture.\n\nSince Wednesday’s debut, she’s been an idiosyncratic icon to loners and goth-adjacents for her unapologetic commitment to the macabre. Yet she’s still an “outlier” among the women and girls of fiction, wrote Emily Alford for Longreads, because she’s never softened or bent to certain story tropes. She is who she is, and she isn’t changing.\n\n“She brought to the screen a morbid self-acceptance that set her apart, and became a crucial blueprint for a generation of girls developing their own gallows humor,” Alford wrote.\n\nAnd now, many of those girls and other users are finding each other on TikTok, where niche communities can blossom (or reach mainstream users). The app is a “space for people to discover who they are, and more importantly, to find other people who share their same interests,” Drenten said, even if those interests involve cosplaying as a certain dispassionate teenager.\n\n“TikTok arguably fosters a lot of reproduction and users can feel pressure to act, perform, and look a certain way,” Drenten said. “But Wednesday reminds people that being themselves in that sea of sameness is freeing.”", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/10/22/detour-destination-2025-expedia-trend/75781200007/", "title": "Why 'detour destinations' are the secret to stress-free travel in 2025", "text": "AI-assisted summary “Detour destinations” are growing in popularity as travelers seek unique experiences near popular tourist spots.\n\nThese detours offer a chance to escape crowds, discover hidden gems, and engage with local culture.\n\nFrom Reims, France to Canmore, Canada, detour destinations provide a diverse range of experiences within easy reach of major hubs.\n\nWill Taylor thinks Santa Barbara is “the perfect antidote to Los Angeles.”\n\nOn a recent trip to Los Angeles, the New York City-based content creator knew he wanted to tack on a few days to fit in a Kacey Musgraves concert. He weighed seeing her in the City of Angels, then decided to look a little outside of the city limits.\n\n“I know it’ll take me an hour to drive across town and it’ll be busy (with traffic),” he told USA TODAY. He noticed Musgraves was also performing in Santa Barbara, where he’s never been.\n\nLess than two hours away by car, Santa Barbara felt like another world to Taylor. “It’s much more intimate, you walk or ride your bike almost everywhere, and it’s not that crowded,” he said. As a design blogger, walking around the neighborhoods to marvel at the beach city’s famous Spanish colonial architecture was particularly attractive.\n\n“Travel is restorative, but it can definitely be stressful and exhausting, especially when it’s a huge city and you have to plan a lot and factor in traffic,” he said. “It’s nice to have a few days in a quieter destination so you can relax.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nTaylor’s experience is hardly unique. If the travel trend of 2024 was “dupe destinations,” places where visitors could catch similar vibes to popular tourist sites, according to Expedia, 2025 will be all about “detour destinations,” or places that are off the beaten path to help travelers get a variety of different experiences on the same trip. A detour doesn’t mean a traveler has to skip out on the main destination altogether, but it can open up opportunities to visit new places and unlock new experiences without having to stray too far from tourist hotspots.\n\n“Next year’s travelers aren’t just taking that dream vacation, they’re adding a trending side trip,” Melanie Fish, vice president of Global Public Relations for Expedia Group told USA TODAY. “It’s a way to feel like you’re hitting that dream destination but you’re also doing something a little bit unexpected. A detour destination is not completely off the beaten path, it’s slightly to the side of the beaten path.”\n\nWhy detour destinations are worth visiting\n\nFor fellow traveler, Melissa Kruse, detour destinations offer an alternative for travelers tired of “seeing the same destinations over and over again” on social media. “Even if they haven’t been there, places have been saturated by seeing them on Instagram and TikTok,” she told USA TODAY. “It makes the experience a little bit less special, I suppose.”\n\nTo kick off a monthlong trip to Spain’s coast in October 2023, Kruse – who had been to Barcelona before – wanted somewhere with a more “local feel.” She chose Girona, a historic city with a thriving food scene and such well-preserved medieval architecture it was used as the backdrop in “Game of Thrones.”\n\n“It feels like a movie set,” she said.\n\nKruse enjoyed wandering the city’s narrow cobblestone streets and how much more affordable it was compared to Barcelona. “For me personally, I prefer more of an authentic experience where you can go to more local hole-in-the-wall restaurants, wherein a lot of major tourist destinations those places are beginning to become harder and harder to find,” she said.\n\nFish said going on a detour can be a great way to experience different aspects of a place. By getting out of the most popular tourist areas, travelers can use their detours to get a more authentic experience or try a new kind of adventure they might not have otherwise.\n\n“A detour destination can provide a completely different experience within reach of a traditional destination,” she said.\n\nReims, France, is a detour destination that Fish said has seen a surge in search traffic on Expedia.\n\n“It’s about 45 minutes from Paris by train, so you can take a day trip, but once you get out there in Champagne country and you see how much there is to experience, there’s a gothic cathedral, there’s champagne houses, vineyard tours,” she said, a very different way to spend a day than a tourist would in the center of Paris.\n\nWhat are the most popular detour destinations?\n\nHere are the destinations Expedia said have received the most increased search attention in the last year:\n\n◾ Reims, France (detour from Paris)\n\n◾ Brescia, Italy (detour from Milan)\n\n◾ Cozumel, Mexico (detour from Cancún)\n\n◾ Santa Barbara, California (detour from Los Angeles)\n\n◾ Waikato, New Zealand (detour from Auckland)\n\n◾ Girona, Spain (detour from Barcelona)\n\n◾ Fukuoka, Japan (detour from Tokyo)\n\n◾ Abu Dhabi, UAE (detour from Dubai)\n\n◾ Krabi, Thailand (detour from Phuket)\n\n◾ Canmore, Alberta, Canada (detour from Calgary)\n\nHow to plan a detour destination side trip\n\nFish said there are plenty of ways to plan a detour, whether it’s finding and pursuing a special activity that interests you or consulting a travel guide. But, she said, you don’t need to feel beholden to preplanned itineraries.\n\nFor Taylor, a concert provided the perfect excuse to check out a detour destination that better \"suits the way I like to travel.”\n\n\"The trend is rooted in specific cities near very popular destinations,” Fish said. “Use it as inspiration. You don’t have to go on a detour that other travelers have already scoped out. Look at a map and design your own detour.”\n\nTo Kruse, a little bit of research went a long way. She learned about Girona when looking up places around the Catalonian coastline of Costa Brava and was drawn to how accessible it was from Barcelona – about an hour by train, with departures almost hourly. Once in Girona, it was easy to get around without a rental car as most of the compact city can be explored by foot, which added to the allure.\n\nFish also said taking a detour can be a great way to shake things up in a place you’ve visited before.\n\n“Even if you think you know an area, try a detour destination and you might just surprise yourself,” she said.\n\n(This story was updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricane/2022/11/25/daytona-storm-damage-tourists-new-residents/10747673002/", "title": "Will coastal Volusia's Tropical Storm Nicole rubble steer tourists and ...", "text": "DAYTONA BEACH — The Boardwalk has a yawning 875-square-foot crater.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised. To find it, look for a stamp showing that the independent, nonprofit US Pharmacopoeial Convention Dietary Supplement Verification Program has tested the product.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}]}

For the past seven years, the exhibit has traveled across North America and is finally touching down in Indianapolis.\n\nAccompanied with lush, orchestral music, a red carpet weaves the way between all 34 frescos and the white pillars that, while part of the architecture of the exhibit's predecessor, Carson's, add to the feeling of navigating a pristine art museum.\n\nLove art? Monet & Friends Alive! is opening at The Lume at Newfields. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nImages of the iconic frescos — images painted directly onto plaster — were taken with high-resolution photography and placed on canvas by a technique called GeckoTek.\n\nBusiness Development Manager Sylvia Noland told IndyStar the artwork appears exactly as Michelangelo painted it.\n\n“When you’re up close, you see the cracks, you can see the brushstrokes, you see everything that Michelangelo did,” Noland said. “This is exactly his work.”\n\nThe exhibit came about after SEE Global Entertainment CEO Martin Biallas visited the Sistine Chapel only to wait in line for two hours and spend merely minutes inside.\n\nBiallas decided there should be a way people could see Michelangelo’s work up-close, in addition to learning some of the story behind each piece.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\n“This exhibition gives visitors a chance to engage with Rome’s most iconic treasures in ways that were never possible,” Biallas said in a written statement.\n\nThere are 34 near-life-size pieces of Michelangelo’s work on display — 33 of the frescos he did on the chapel’s interior over the course of five years, and “The Last Judgment,” a sprawling, 400-character piece of art that, in the Vatican City chapel, covers the entire altar wall.\n\nAt each fresco, there is a placard that shows where that particular painting is on the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel.\n\nNoland said this exhibit is special because one would not have the opportunity to see the intricacies of each fresco in Vatican City, where they look postage stamp-sized from every available vantage point.\n\nAnd, unlike Vatican City, visitors can take as many photos as they please, so long as they abstain from using flash.\n\n“Art is an amazing thing,” Noland said. “This is one of the highest acclaimed artistic achievements in mankind … and to see it up close, it’s great.”\n\nHow it works\n\nThe Sistine Chapel exhibit is a self-guided tour through 10,000 square feet of artwork.\n\nIn addition to the placards, Noland said there is an audio guide that tells the listener exactly who is in each painting, why Michelangelo painted them and what their historical significance is.\n\nThe guide for each painting is available on an app, which can be downloaded upon entry, but a QR code on each placard allows for individual scanning, as well.\n\nThe audio guide is an hour-and-a-half in its entirety.\n\nAdditionally, upon entry, there is a 20-minute, animated Michelangelo cartoon video, created by Nathan Heck, that provides fun facts about the yearslong process of creating the frescos.\n\nWhy Circle Centre Mall?\n\nNoland, who selects the venues for the exhibit in each state, said she was very excited to bring a piece of Vatican City to Circle Centre Mall.\n\nInitially, the exhibit was actually supposed to open earlier this year, but had to be delayed after the recognition of some ceiling drop-downs that were not accounted for in the site inspection.\n\nThere are two units of art for the exhibit — a large and a small one — and while the large unit was initially brought to the mall, not all of the pieces would have been able to fit in the space permitted by the ceiling height.\n\nNoland said since they were not just going to bring some of the frescos, the smaller unit had to finish its run in another city before it could be brought to Indianapolis.\n\n“The Sistine Chapel is an inspiring and unforgettable experience and bringing a small piece of that to Downtown Indianapolis is something we are really proud of,” Circle Centre Retail Marketing Manager Sarah Grannan said in a written statement.\n\nIndy parking: Daily parking rates increasing at Circle Centre Mall garages\n\nMichelangelo's Sistine Chapel: The Exhibition — If you go\n\nMichelangelo’s Sistine Chapel: The Exhibition runs from July 8-Aug. 28 in the former Carson’s store in Circle Centre Mall. Entry to the exhibit is located at 1 W. Washington St. and is accessed from the mall's exterior.\n\nThe exhibition is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday.

Kilroy Was Here is a nod to that history, but we're having some fun with it.\"\n\nThe catchphrase originated at the Fore River shipyard in the early 1940s when inspector James Kilroy, of Halifax, wrote it on ships and equipment he had inspected.

The Quincy-born icon was a finalist to become a stamp in 2008 and again in 2015, but never made the cut. A locally run website, kilroywashere.org, still pushes for the honor.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, the oldest of Kilroy's nine children, Margaret Kilroy Fitzgerald, was 75 years old.

Fitzgerald said her father owned a moving business and a gas station, but when World War II hit, his businesses slumped and he started a 20-year career at the shipyard.\n\n“He never tried to capitalize on it,” she said. “He had no intention of starting a legend. He said he was just doing his job.”\n\nThe USS Salem, Discover Quincy and the Quincy Sun newspaper hosted a Kilroy Was Here photo contest in 2005 that drew more than 320 entries from five continents.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, the Ohio Historical Society hosted a Kilroy Was Here exhibit with life-sized family scenes from before, during and after World War II, complemented by videotaped recollections of Ohioans who lived during the era.

We also can't forget those other holiday specials created in its wake and that we also look forward to, led by Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas (1966) ...\n\n17. And Frosty the Snowman (1969).\n\n50 years in, 'Charlie Brown Christmas' remains timeless\n\n18. But still, \"if you want Christ in Christmas, you pretty much have to turn to Charlie,\" writes USA TODAY's Robert Bianco. It's one of the only specials to reference the religious holiday.\n\n19. We recall Charlie Brown Christmas stressed many morals to live by, such as ... The biggest tree isn’t always the best tree.\n\n20. And there’s more to Christmas than opening presents and spending money.\n\n21. If you want to try catching snowflakes on your tongue, it's best to wait for January snowflakes.

It’s OK to feel depressed at Christmas.\n\n24, Every neighborhood could benefit from a low-cost psychiatric booth!\n\n25. Where else could we learn that pantophobia is the fear of everything?\n\n26. And periodically, we are reminded: Wouldn’t it be awesome to have a dog just like Snoopy?\n\n27. As fans of animated projects can tell you: The special also inspired future animators to give us their gifts: Pete Docter (Toy Story, Monsters, Inc.); Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo). ...\n\n28. Just as Guaraldi's compositions inspired other musicians, such as George Winston and David Benoit, to give us theirs.\n\n29. If we look around during the holidays, Charlie Brown Christmas inspired some of our favorite Christmas decorations for our own homes, including versions of the iconic spindly tree and even metallic trees. What? You didn't want a metallic tree — ever?\n\n30. It is a holiday special that every family member can agree on. \"It's part of tradition — not just for my family but for so many,' actress Kristin Chenoweth tells USA TODAY's Patrick Ryan. She played Charlie Brown's little sister, Sally, on Broadway.\n\n31. Which reminds us: The special spawned many stage adaptations. Who'd you want to be?\n\n32. And, ironically, inspired Macy’s window displays in New York.\n\n33. We feel nostalgic for the special when we see the Snoopy balloon at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade, and also ...\n\n34. The Charlie Brown balloon at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade.\n\n35. And well, every true fan has to have commemorative postage stamps with the Charlie Brown theme!\n\n36. And for '90s sitcom fans, the special brings a smile as they consider the possibility that Charlie’s Christmas tree inspired Seinfeld’s Festivus pole, related to a holiday invented by George’s dad, Frank Costanza.\n\n37. And Saturday Night Live fans can do the same as they recall the “You’re a Rat Bastard Charlie Brown” skit.\n\n38. Another tie to recent TV: An ad executive at McCann-Erickson, whose client Coca-Cola commissioned the special, was almost certain his client would kill the project. Hello, Mad Men fans!\n\n39. But on a more serious note, Charlie Brown Christmas reminds people of the literary value of the New Testament (or at least the King James version).\n\n40. No one can forget the innocent voice of the little boy who played Linus (who does the reciting) which was the perfect vehicle for telling the old story from the Gospels.\n\n'A Charlie Brown Christmas' almost never happened\n\n41. But even more seriously, if its intention has been to shout, “STOP!” to rampant commercialism, then, alas, it has been a FAIL. Compared to 50 years ago, commercialism is now far more rampant and Christmas is far more tedious. And so, Charlie Brown Christmas is a timeless classic to return to on TV to escape the madness.\n\n42. The special foreshadows Black Friday brawling when Linus utters: \"Christmas is not only getting too commercial, it's getting too dangerous.\"\n\n43. It has a groundbreaking legacy to continue: In 1966. tomboyish Peppermint Patty would be introduced as the first cartoon character on TV who was not a girlie-girl.\n\n44. And a few years after that, Franklin, the first African-American Peanuts character would join the gang. He appeared first in the strip in 1968 and then first in a special in Snoopy, Come Home in 1972. What a wonderful world indeed.\n\n45. The prospect of Woodstock joining the gang would continue the theme of kindness. A dog and a bird as interspecies pals: Of course we can all get along.\n\n46. Just like horse-race jockey colors, we root for our favorite Peanuts character’s signature outfit such as purple and black horizontal stripes on Schroeder ...\n\n47. Lucy’s blue dress with black and white oxford shoes ...\n\n48. Charlie Brown’s yellow shirt with thick, black, jagged-line trim ...\n\n49. And Pig-Pen's cloud of dust.\n\n50. Finally, A Charlie Brown Christmas reminds us that sometimes, we overthink this whole Christmas thing. (\"Charlie Brown, you're the only person I know who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem,\" Linus says.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/30"}]}

Her wounds were “very serious,” Wedding said at the time.\n\nNo law enforcement officers fired shots, according to Sheriff Rick Singleton of Lauderdale County, Alambama, where the pair – who are not related – fled on April 29.\n\nBefore the chase ensued, officers conducting surveillance spotted Vicky White exiting a hotel with a wig on, according to US Marshal Marty Keely. Then, she and Casey White got into a car and drove away.\n\nAuthorities continued to watch them until a vehicle pursuit began, ending when a US Marshals task force member drove a vehicle into the Cadillac the pair were in. The car wrecked and rolled over, he said. Casey White was driving the car, according to the US Marshals, though Wedding had earlier told reporters Vicky White was the driver.\n\nOfficers were able to remove the inmate from the wrecked car, but Vicky White was pinned inside with a gunshot wound to her head, Keely said.\n\nCasey White reportedly told officers to help “his wife” who had shot herself in the head, according to Keely, and told them he didn’t do it. Keely said to their knowledge Casey White and Vicky White are not married.\n\nThe scene at the end of the police chase in Evansville, Indiana. WFIE\n\nThe pair’s capture brought to a close an 11-day manhunt that gained widespread national attention and saw hundreds of tips flood in from all corners of the country, including one that ultimately lead to the location and arrest of the fugitives.\n\nThat tip came Sunday night, Singleton said.\n\nWedding said the duo were believed to have been in Evansville since May 3. “It’s hard to believe they’ve been here that many days, but we’re lucky that we stumbled upon them today,” he said.\n\nSingleton said Casey White, 38, will be brought back to Alabama. The inmate faces previous murder charges. Vicky White, 56, was first charged with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree and was later facing additional forgery and identity theft charges.\n\n“He will be in a cell by himself,” Singleton said. “He will stay in handcuffs and shackles while he’s in that cell and if he wants to sue me for violating his civil rights, so be it. He’s not getting out of this jail again. I’ll assure you that.”\n\nSingleton said, “I’ve always expected this outcome. I knew we would catch them. It was just a matter of time.”\n\nMost escapes from a county jail are spontaneous, he said.\n\n“This escape was obviously well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles, had everything they needed to pull this off, and that’s what made this last week and a half so challenging. We were starting from ground zero, and not only that, we started – they got a six-hour head start on us.”\n\nPhotos from Indiana car wash released\n\nEarlier Monday, US Marshals released photos of who they believe was Casey White caught on a surveillance camera at an Evansville car wash.\n\nIt was the first time since he escaped a Lauderdale County detention center with Vicky White that he was reported seen.\n\nVicky White was not seen in the photos.\n\nUS Marshals released photos of who they believe is fugitive Casey White at an Indiana car wash. US Marshals Service\n\nInvestigators were notified Sunday night that a 2006 Ford F-150 had been discovered at a car wash in Evansville, about 175 miles north of Williamson County, Tennessee, where the 2007 Ford Edge the pair had been traveling in was found abandoned.\n\nThe owner provided the images from a security camera, US Marshals said in a release.\n\nMarshals went to Indiana following up on the tip, the agency said.\n\nUS Marshals Service said it believes the person in the photo is Casey White. US Marshals Service\n\nA reward of up to $15,000 was offered for information leading to his capture, and $10,000 for information leading to Vicky White’s capture.\n\nVicky White was facing multiple charges\n\nBefore she died, Vicky White was facing new forgery and identity theft charges in Alabama, in addition to the charge of permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree that was filed last week.\n\nThe new charges were announced Monday and stemmed from the officer using an alias to purchase the vehicle used in the escape, a 2007 Ford Edge, officials said.\n\nVicky White, who was an assistant director of corrections for Lauderdale County, took Casey White from the county jail on April 29, saying she was taking him for a mental health evaluation, which authorities learned later had never been scheduled. She then said she was going to get medical care after dropping the inmate off because she wasn’t feeling well.\n\nVicky White’s use of aliases may have complicated the search, Singleton said Monday.\n\n“If she was using her own identity, that would make it fairly easy for us to maybe find her,” Singleton told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga. “We do know she used a false identification to purchase a car here locally.”.\n\nBefore Vicky White’s death, Singleton said he hoped she would survive her injuries.\n\n“We don’t wish any ill will on Vicky, but she has some answers to give us,” he said. “I have every bit of trust in (her). She had been an exemplary employee. I don’t know if we’ll ever know” what happened to change that.\n\nSurveillance video footage of Vicky White taken before the getaway showed the level of preparation that went into the escape, Singleton said.\n\nInvestigators found footage of White shopping for men’s clothes at a department store and at an “adult store,” Singleton said, adding she “obviously had a change of clothes” for the inmate.\n\n“It just tells us that it was very well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “Obviously she well-planned this escape down to a T.”\n\nInvestigators earlier released video footage showing Vicky White at a Quality Inn in Florence, where she stayed the night before the escape more than a week ago.\n\nThe patrol car the officer and inmate took from the jail was found abandoned in a shopping center parking lot. Vicky White’s jail keys, radio and handcuffs were found inside. Authorities believe the pair left the lot in a different vehicle: Vicky White’s 2007 Ford SUV she parked in the lot the night before.\n\nThe vehicle was spotted on May 6 at a Tennessee tow lot. The car had been abandoned in the woods without any identifying information on the same day the duo escaped, indicating they drove about two hours north from the jail in Florence to Williamson County, Tennessee.\n\nAuthorities believe the vehicle may have had mechanical problems that prompted the abrupt stop in the area.\n\nVicky White and Casey White had known each other since at least 2020, the sheriff told CNN earlier this week.\n\nPrior to their disappearance, Vicky White had announced plans to retire and sold her home for a price well below market value.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how Casey White's criminal history led him to Vicky White 02:32 - Source: CNN Here's how Casey White's criminal history led him to Vicky White 02:32\n\nThe sheriff’s office had announced on May 4 that she was no longer employed by them, adding that while April 29 was her last day of work, her retirement papers were never finalized.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the wrong first name for US Marshal Marty Keely.", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop Elizabeth Wolfe Jaide Timm-Garcia", "Theresa Waldrop", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Jaide Timm-Garcia"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/cnn-info/vicky-white-what-we-know-alabama-inmate-disappear", "title": "Vicky White: A respected officer turned into a fugitive who allgedly ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt 56, Vicky White was on the brink of retiring from an illustrious career as a corrections officer.\n\n“She was a model employee,” said Rick Singleton, the sheriff in Lauderdale County, Alabama, where Vicky White worked for nearly two decades.\n\n“All of her co-workers, all the employees in the sheriff’s office, the judges, all (had) the … utmost respect for her,” he said.\n\nWhite, who was the county’s assistant director of corrections, was so well respected that “some of the older guys looked up to her as a mother figure,” Singleton added.\n\nBut despite Vicky White’s stellar reputation, the jail boss apparently helped “mastermind” a plan to flee with inmate Casey White, the sheriff told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nAfter 11 days on the run, authorities found the pair Monday in Evansville, Indiana. Casey White was arrested. Authorities say they believe that Vicky White fatally shot herself. “We believe that she may have taken her own life,” said Dave Wedding, the sheriff in Vanderburgh County, Indiana.\n\nHere’s what we know about what led up to Vicky White’s apparent transformation and death:\n\nOfficials believe the pair had a ‘special’ relationship\n\nVicky White, a widow with no children, and Casey White, a 38-year-old convicted felon and murder suspect, had a “special relationship,” Singleton said last week.\n\n“We have confirmed through independent sources and other means that there was in fact a relationship between Casey White and Vicky White outside of her normal work hours – not physical contact – but a relationship of a different nature,” the sheriff said.\n\nHe said interviews with other inmates helped confirm a personal relationship between Casey White and Vicky White, who were not related. “We were told Casey White got special privileges and was treated differently while in the facility than the other inmates,” Singleton said.\n\nInmates said Casey White “was getting extra food on his trays” and “was getting privileges no one else got. And this was all coming from her,” Singleton said.\n\nConfirmation of the relationship came from “other sources outside the detention center,” according to Singleton.\n\nInvestigators have traced the relationship back to early 2020. Casey White, who had been serving a 75-year sentence in a state prison for a series of crimes in 2015, was brought to the Lauderdale County jail in 2020 for his arraignment on murder charges in the death of Connie Ridgeway.\n\n“As far as we know, that was the earliest physical contact they had,” the Lauderdale County sheriff said.\n\nAfter the arraignment, Casey White returned to state prison. But Singleton said the officer and inmate kept communicating by phone.\n\nCasey White was brought back to the Lauderdale County jail in February to attend court hearings related to his murder charges.\n\nLauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly said he was stunned that Vicky White may have been romantically involved with an inmate. “I never would have thought that in a million years,” said Connolly, who spoke with Vicky White almost every day for 17 years.\n\nHe said Vicky White was “the most solid person at the jail.”\n\n“I would have trusted her with my life,” he said.\n\nVicky White funded the escape after selling her house\n\nShortly before her disappearance, Vicky White sold her home for $95,550 – less than half the current market value. County records list the total parcel value of the property at $235,600.\n\nShe also purchased a 2007 Ford Edge, one of several vehicles the pair used to flee. The Ford was found abandoned in Williamson County, Tennessee, hours after the prison escape.\n\nVicky White purchased a 2007 Ford Edge before disappearing. From US Marshals Service\n\n“Clearly lots of planning went into this,” Connolly said.\n\nDuring her time on the run, Vicky White became a fugitive with an arrest warrant in her name. She was accused of permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree, identity theft and forgery.\n\nSingleton said he believes Vicky White “was basically the mastermind behind the whole plan.”\n\n“He (Casey White) was behind bars. He really couldn’t plan too much behind bars. Personally, I think she was the one to put the plan together,” the sheriff said.\n\nBut former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker said he believes Casey White may have manipulated Vicky White. “This is not terribly unusual, that you have this guard falling in love with a prisoner who’s probably groomed her over a period of time,” Swecker said.\n\n“So he obviously needed her. You would think someone with law enforcement experience – an assistant director of corrections in that county – would have thought a little bit farther down the line,” he said.\n\n“She obviously lost all judgment over the last few months or so.”\n\nShe talked about retiring and going to the beach\n\nThe day Vicky White disappeared was supposed to be her last day at work, Singleton said.\n\nShe had worked at the department for almost two decades and submitted her retirement paperwork at the end of April, though the retirement papers had not yet been finalized.\n\nSingleton said Vicky White had talked about retiring for three or four months prior to her disappearance. He said she talked about moving to the beach.\n\nBut Vicky White didn’t mention her retirement to her mother, Pat Davis, the mother told CNN affiliate WAAY.\n\nVicky White used her position as a boss to violate jail policy, sheriff says\n\nAs the second in command at the detention center, Vicky White used her position to execute the escape plan on April 29, Singleton said.\n\nVicky White said she was taking Casey White to a courthouse for a mental health evaluation and would then go get medical care because she wasn’t feeling well.\n\nAuthorities later discovered no hearing or evaluation was scheduled for Casey White that day. And Vicky White never arrived at the medical facility.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows the moment an Alabama inmate escaped 03:24 - Source: CNN Video shows the moment an Alabama inmate escaped 03:24\n\nVicky White violated jail protocol when she removed Casey White from the detention center by herself, Singleton said. The policy required Casey White to be escorted by two sworn deputies.\n\nHer patrol car was later found abandoned in a shopping center parking lot, less than a mile from the detention center.\n\nOfficials obtained video showing the patrol car the pair left in. The video shows the car stopped at an intersection eight minutes after it left the jail. The intersection is about two blocks from the shopping center parking lot where the car was later found abandoned, Singleton said.\n\n“It’s obvious from the evidence we have gathered that this was not – that he didn’t kidnap her or force her or anything as far as in the car once they left the facility,” Singleton said.\n\n“She scheduled the van transport that morning, made sure all the other armed deputies were out of the building and tied up in court. Knew the booking officer wouldn’t question her, the assistant director when she told her she was going to take him to court and drop him off with other employees,” the sheriff said.\n\n“She arranged – purchased the getaway car, she sold her house, got her hands on cash, she went shopping, bought clothes for him,” Singleton said Tuesday.\n\nNot ‘the Vicky White we know’\n\nLoved ones and former colleagues have been grappling with a barrage of emotions since Vicky White’s unexpected disappearance.\n\nDavis, Vicky White’s mother, told CNN last week that they last spoke on April 29 – the day Vicky White disappeared.\n\n“The whole thing has been a nightmare. I just want my daughter to come home. And to come home alive,” Davis said.\n\nDavis said she had no idea about her daughter’s plans to flee with an inmate.\n\n“She would come home after work, eat supper at my house, and pick up her dog. She’d walk her dog and that was her routine every day,” Davis said.\n\nSingleton said the Vicky White who fled with an inmate is not “the Vicky White we know.”\n\n“Vicky White was a member of our family. That’s why it was so hard in the first few days to grasp that she could actually do something like this because it was so out of character for her,” the sheriff said.\n\n“In spite of what she’s done, Vicky was a friend to every one of us,” he said. “It has been an emotional roller coaster for our employees.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had an outdated value for Vicky White's home; the most recent value was $235,600.

Their travels – which authorities say involved at least four vehicles from Alabama to Indiana – sparked a multistate manhunt.\n\nBut they appeared equipped for more hiding: In the Cadillac, police found wigs, four handguns, an AR-15 rifle and about $29,000 in cash, Wedding said Tuesday. Police previously said Vicky White probably was using cash from a recent home sale.\n\nThe pair ended up being in Evansville for a week, but had paid for a 14-day stay at the motel, Wedding said.\n\n“They thought … they’d driven long enough that they wanted to stop for a while, get their bearings straight, and then figure out their next place for travel,” Wedding said.\n\nA third person may have helped the couple book the motel room, according to a preliminary investigation. Casey White and Vicky White tried to get a room initially, but could not because she did not have identification, Wedding said. The room had been paid for for 14 days, he said, and when the two left, it looked like it had been “cleaned out,” he said.\n\nThe manager of the motel told CNN he never saw the fugitives and didn’t know they were staying there. It’s possible they were visiting someone staying at the motel or someone else checked into a room for them, he said.\n\nIn Indiana’s Vanderburgh County jail Tuesday, Casey White waived his right to an extradition hearing.\n\n“I want to go back to Alabama,” Casey White, wearing a yellow jumpsuit and orange slides, said while appearing virtually before a judge.\n\nHe is scheduled to arrive in Lauderdale County Tuesday evening and will be taken to the courthouse for arraignment. He then will be transferred to state Department of Corrections custody in Jefferson County instead of county custody, said Rick Singleton, sheriff of Alabama’s Lauderdale County and Vicky White’s former boss.\n\nLive updates: The latest on the Alabama fugitive case\n\nCasey White has been speaking freely with investigators after his capture, Wedding said Tuesday.\n\n“He was pretty candid with the investigators last night. They had a fairly lengthy interview,” Wedding said.\n\nWhat led to the chase\n\nVicky White, 56, and Casey White, 38, are believed to have been in Evansville since at least May 2, when a city police officer proactively checked the license plate of a 2006 Ford F-150 truck, Evansville Police Chief Billy Bolin said Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities now believe the pair had bought the truck on the lam in Tennessee – but the May 2 check did not indicate any connection between the truck and the fugitive pair, Bolin said.\n\nUS marshals looking for the pair said they learned Sunday that the truck was abandoned at an Evansville car wash – an abandonment that Bolin said was initially reported to city police May 4.\n\nOn Monday, US marshals announced that surveillance images from the car wash showed Casey White there with the truck on May 3. Investigators learned that the pair left the car wash in a Cadillac, Wedding said, adding he didn’t know how they obtained that vehicle.\n\nAlso Monday, an Evansville police officer noticed the Cadillac in the motel’s parking lot and “notified us immediately,” Wedding said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Escaped Alabama inmate caught after chase 01:34 - Source: CNN Escaped Alabama inmate caught after chase 01:34\n\nLaw enforcement officers then watched the motel. Officers saw Vicky White exit the motel Monday wearing a wig, US Marshal Marty Keely said. Then, she and Casey White got into the Cadillac and drove away.\n\nAuthorities gave chase. The pair “fled out of the hotel parking lot, northbound on US Highway 41 (and) turned in at an industry known as Anchor here in Evansville,” Wedding said.\n\n“They went through the parking lot (and) went through a grass field. The members of the US task force basically rammed the vehicle and pushed it into a ditch,” Wedding said at Tuesday’s news conference.\n\nThe car wrecked and rolled over, Keely said. Casey White was driving the car, according to the US Marshals.\n\nCasey White reportedly told authorities to help “his wife” who had shot herself in the head and told them he didn’t do it, according to Keely. Casey White and Vicky White were not married to investigators’ knowledge, Keely said, and authorities have previously said they were not related.\n\nAuthorities preliminarily believe that Vicky White shot herself “once the vehicle crashed,” Wedding said. She died at a hospital later Monday.\n\nA coroner will confirm whether Vicky White shot herself, Wedding said.\n\nU.S. Marshals released photos on Monday afternoon of who they believe is fugitive Casey White caught on surveillance at an Indiana car wash. US Marshals Service\n\nVicky White indicated ‘she had her finger on the trigger,’ dispatcher is heard saying\n\nDuring the chase, Vicky White indicated during a call with police dispatchers that she had a gun, Wedding told CNN, hours before Tuesday’s news conference.\n\nIn dispatch audio from Evansville police, a dispatcher noted during Monday’s chase that “we could hear her on the line saying she had her finger on the trigger.” The dispatcher earlier can be heard saying “they’re calling into 911.”\n\nIt’s not clear who made the 911 call. Authorities have not released the audio that they believe contains Vicky White’s voice.\n\nNo law enforcement officers fired any shots during the chase, according to Singleton.\n\nThe scene at the end of the chase in Evansville, Indiana.

As the investigation unfolded, the sheriff acknowledged her apparent behavior is inconsistent with the person her colleagues thought they knew.\n\n“Obviously there was a side to Vicky White that we weren’t aware of,” he told CNN previously.\n\nThough authorities have said the pair may have had a romantic relationship, in part from what other inmates have said after the pair’s escape, Singleton said Monday there was still more to learn about why Vicky White was involved\n\n“What in the world provoked her, prompted her to pull a stunt like this, I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll ever know,” Singleton said.\n\nSearch was challenging for investigators\n\nVicky White “was basically the mastermind behind the whole plan,” Singleton said Tuesday.\n\n“He was behind bars.

We were starting from ground zero, and not only that … they got a six-hour head start on us.”\n\nInvestigators previously released video of Vicky White at a Quality Inn in Florence, Alabama, where they say she stayed the night before the escape. Singleton also said they have footage of her shopping for men’s clothing at a department store and at an “adult store,” adding that she “obviously had a change of clothes” for the inmate.\n\nBefore her disappearance, Vicky White submitted her retirement papers, sold her home for well below market value and purchased the car the pair would use to escape, officials have said.\n\nThe day of the disappearance was set to be her last day of work, but her retirement papers were never finalized, according to Singleton. The Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office announced last week that she was no longer employed there.\n\nCounselors will be made available at the Lauderdale County Detention Center for staff who may need them after Vicky White’s death, according to Singleton.\n\n“It’s a small agency, like family,” he told CNN. “Some of these younger deputies she was like a mother figure to them and I know they’re going to take it hard.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the location of Vanderburgh County; it is in Indiana.

Immediately after Ryan shared an intimate photo of his own, the cybercriminal demanded $5,000, threatening to make the photo public and send it to Ryan’s family and friends.\n\nRyan Last. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nThe San Jose, California, teen told the cybercriminal he could not pay the full amount, and the demand was ultimately lowered to a fraction of the original figure – $150. But after paying the scammers from his college savings, Stuart said, “They kept demanding more and more and putting lots of continued pressure on him.”\n\nAt the time, Stuart knew none of what her son was experiencing. She learned the details after law enforcement investigators reconstructed the events leading up to his death.\n\nShe had said goodnight to Ryan at 10 p.m., and described him as her usually happy son. By 2 a.m., he had been scammed, and taken his life. Ryan left behind a suicide note describing how embarrassed he was for himself and the family.\n\n“He really, truly thought in that time that there wasn’t a way to get by if those pictures were actually posted online,” Pauline said. “His note showed he was absolutely terrified. No child should have to be that scared.”\n\nLaw enforcement calls the scam “sextortion,” and investigators have seen an explosion in complaints from victims leading the FBI to ramp up a campaign to warn parents from coast to coast.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback An inside look at sextortion (2017) 02:19 - Source: CNN An inside look at sextortion (2017) 02:19\n\nThe bureau says there were over 18,000 sextortion-related complaints in 2021, with losses in excess of $13 million. The FBI says the use of child pornography by criminals to lure suspects also constitutes a serious crime.\n\nThe investigation into Last’s case is ongoing, Stuart and the FBI tell CNN.\n\n“To be a criminal that specifically targets children – it’s one of the more deeper violations of trust I think in society,” says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dan Costin, who leads a team of investigators working to counter crimes against children.\n\nAccording to Costin, many of the sextortion scams reported to the FBI are determined to be from criminals on the African continent and in Southeast Asia. Federal investigators are working with their law enforcement counterparts around the world, Costin said, to help identify and arrest perpetrators who are targeting kids online.\n\nRyan Last and his mother, Pauline Stuart. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nOne challenge for the FBI: many victims of sextortion do not report the incidents to law enforcement.\n\n“The embarrassment piece of this is probably one of the bigger hurdles that the victims have to overcome,” said Costin. “It can be a lot, especially in that moment.”\n\nBut investigators urge victims to quickly contact law enforcement, either online or at their local FBI field office.\n\nMedical experts say there’s a key reason why young males are especially vulnerable to sextortion-related scams.\n\n“Teen brains are still developing,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General in Boston. “So when something catastrophic happens, like a personal picture is released to people online, it’s hard for them to look past that moment and understand that in the big scheme of things they’ll be able to get through this.”\n\nHadland said there are steps parents can take to help safeguard their kids from online harm.\n\n“The most important thing that a parent should do with their teen is try to understand what they’re doing online,” she said. “You want to know when they’re going online, who they’re interacting with, what platforms they’re using. Are they being approached by people that they don’t know, are they experiencing pressure to share information or photos?”\n\nHadland said it’s also critical that parents specifically warn teens of scams like sextortion, without shaming them.\n\n“You want to make it clear that they can talk to you if they have done something, or they feel like they’ve made a mistake,” he said.\n\nRyan’s mom agrees.\n\n“You need to talk to your kids because we need to make them aware of it,” Stuart said.\n\nStill grieving the loss of her son, she is channeling her family’s pain into action, and honoring Ryan by speaking out and telling his story. She hopes that doing so will help save lives.\n\n“How could these people look at themselves in the mirror knowing that $150 is more important than a child’s life?” she says. “There’s no other word but ‘evil’ for me that they care much more about money than a child’s life. I don’t want anybody else to go through what we did.”", "authors": ["Josh Campbell Jason Kravarik", "Josh Campbell", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/us/oklahoma-missing-bikers-what-we-know", "title": "Okmulgee missing men: Person of interest in Oklahoma river killings ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe man who was named as a person of interest in the gruesome killings of four men who were shot, dismembered and found in an Oklahoma river last week was taken into custody Tuesday in Florida on an unrelated charge, authorities said.\n\nJoe Kennedy, 67, was arrested in Daytona Beach Shores in a vehicle that was reported stolen on Monday, Okmulgee Police said. He is being held on a charge of grand theft of a motor vehicle with no bond, according to the Volusia County inmate record.\n\n“The District Attorney and the Sheriff will begin the process of getting Kennedy back to Okmulgee County,” police said in a statement. “The murder investigation is ongoing and investigators continue to follow leads every day.”\n\nPolice have not detailed why Kennedy is a person of interest and they have not named him a suspect in the murders.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant in Florida, he was reported as a missing person, but Kennedy advised police he was not a missing person and was not in any danger. He was transported to Volusia County Branch Jail, where jail records list him as being charged with grand theft of a motor vehicle and being a fugitive from justice.\n\nHe is also being held on a warrant issued for his arrest in Okmulgee County District Court in relation to a shooting in 2012. He is set to appear before a Volusia County judge on Wednesday afternoon, according to the clerk of courts.\n\nIt is unclear whether Kennedy has an attorney.\n\nThe arrest comes a week since four men – Mark Chastain, 32; Billy Chastain, 30; Mike Sparks, 32; and Alex Stevens, 29 – were reported missing after leaving Billy Chastain’s home on bicycles around 9 p.m. on October 9, according to Police Chief Joe Prentice.\n\nTheir bodies, which had been shot and dismembered, were found days later in a river outside Okmulgee, a city of about 11,000 people roughly a 35-mile drive south of Tulsa.\n\n“Although the official cause and manner of death is still pending, each victim suffered gunshot wounds,” Prentice said. “All four bodies were dismembered before being placed in the river, and that is what caused difficulty in determining identities.”\n\nThe remains were recovered over several days, and it’s not clear what kind of evidence investigators will be able to recover.\n\n“Whenever water is involved, it makes it much more difficult to identify evidence,” the chief said.\n\nPolice have not recovered any bicycles, nor the gun used in the killings.\n\nPolice believe the 4 friends were planning a crime\n\nPolice traced the path of the men's cell phones to two area salvage yards, the police chief said. KJRH\n\nWhile it remains unclear exactly what led up to the men’s deaths, it appears they were planning to commit a crime when they left Billy Chastain’s home, Prentice said, citing a preliminary investigation.\n\nThe belief is based on “information supplied by a witness who reports they were invited to go with the men to quote, unquote, ‘Hit a lick big enough for all of them,’” the chief said Monday in a news conference.\n\n“That is common terminology for engaging in some type of criminal behavior, but we do not know what they were planning or where they planned to do it,” Prentice added.\n\nAfter the men were reported missing, police said they believed at least two of the men had cell phones with them. Investigators traced the phones’ path, finding the devices went to two salvage yards – one about 5 miles from the river, and the other about 10 to 12 miles from the river, Prentice told CNN on Saturday.\n\nPolice later found “evidence of a violent event” on property adjoining one of those locations, the chief said without elaborating.\n\nThe chief said police had a “person of interest” in the case Monday, describing them as someone “we’d like to talk to.” However, the person had gone missing as of Saturday night and could be suicidal, Prentice said.\n\nNow that the case is a murder probe, police will be more tight-lipped about further proceedings “to protect the integrity of the investigation,” the chief said.\n\n“I’ve worked over 80 murders in my career. I have worked murders involving multiple victims. I have worked dismemberments, but this case involves the highest number of victims, and it’s a very violent event,” Prentice said.\n\nJon Chastain, the uncle of Mark and Billy Chastain, told CNN their family was “shocked,” “outraged,” and filled with “heartbreak” when police announced the brothers, along with their two friends, were found murdered and dismembered.\n\n“I’m a hard guy. People don’t see me cry,” Chastain said. “And I was devastated.”\n\nChastain said he could not envision his nephews doing anything to warrant so much violence.\n\nMark was the father of two children, and Billy had four children. Chastain described them as hard workers and good fathers who loved their families.\n\n“Whatever was going on, I don’t know. But what I do know is we need some justice for this,” Chastain said.\n\nThe families, he said, were already struggling financially before the deaths and have created a GoFundMe page to help cover funeral costs.", "authors": ["Ed Lavandera Ashley Killough Amanda Watts Nouran Salahieh", "Ed Lavandera", "Ashley Killough", "Amanda Watts", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/09/08/upcoming-concerts-phoenix-fall-tours/1193542002/", "title": "Upcoming concerts in Phoenix: Travis Scott, Childish Gambino ...", "text": "Childish Gambino and Travis Scott are the season's last two big arena shows as we head into winter.\n\nHere's a look at those and other concerts swinging through the Valley's biggest rooms, from rock and pop to hip-hop, R&B and country.\n\n12/12: The Robert Cray Band\n\nIt’s been 32 years since “Strong Persuader” took this soulful blues guitarist to the mainstream, largely on the strength of “Smoking Gun,” a breakthrough single that remains his biggest hit.\n\nIt’s doubtful Cray, now 64, will ever top the double-platinum benchmark set by “Strong Persuader.” But the album this tour is supporting, “Robert Cray & Hi Rhythm,” proves that Cray still has a lot to offer as a mainstream blues ambassador.\n\nNeed a break?

For the latest news, view our story for Sunday, Feb. 2.\n\nPHILADELPHIA ‒ A Medevac jet that plummeted from the sky and crashed in a fiery explosion into a busy neighborhood on Friday evening killed at least seven people, injured 19 others and has left a path of carnage.\n\nAs investigators combed the area for evidence on Saturday, residents were still reeling from the sight of the crash. People gathered in the Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood from dawn to mid-afternoon to see what remained of Friday's nightmare. They stood yards away from a debris field of broken plane pieces and singed cars to get a glimpse of the wreckage.\n\nA huge crater was blown out of the city street where a Learjet 55 carrying six Mexican nationals nosedived into the ground at almost 300 mph, according to initial reports. There were two chunks of the plane’s charred fuselage in the street. Several cars caught in the blast during the evening rush rested at extreme angles ‒ one was so thoroughly incinerated that only a blackened metal skeleton remained.\n\nMany described the moment the plane hit as akin to a war zone. Andre Boldin said the jet sounded like a missile sputtering overhead. Nearby, Andre Gary said he believed the world was ending as he watched it fall like a meteor from the sky.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep last night,” said Bill Vitelli, whose windows rattled when the jet crashed. \"We’ll know what happened, eventually, but why do these things happen? Maybe only God can explain it.”\n\nDeaths and injuries reported\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker on Saturday morning confirmed that all six people on the plane died, along with one person who was in their car when the medical flight struck the ground, hurtling debris far and wide. She and other officials warned that the count of injured and dead could rise as recovery efforts continue.\n\nShe thanked first responders and said crews and investigators worked through the night and will continue to work to learn what happened.\n\n\"We will find a cause for this tragedy,\" she said.\n\nThe six people on board the jet were from Mexico, including a young girl ‒ who had been treated at Shriners Children's Philadelphia, her mother, a medical crew, and the pilots, said Jet Rescue Air Ambulance Spokesperson Shai Gold.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the deaths and offered condolences to the families impacted in a Saturday morning post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the jet departed from Northeast Philadelphia Airport and crashed around 6:30 p.m. Friday as it was headed to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri. The plane crashed near the Roosevelt Mall at Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard, a busy hub with dozens of businesses and hundreds of homes.\n\nThe crash in Philadelphia comes in the wake of the midair collision in Washington D.C. that killed 67 people. The collision of an Army helicopter and American Airlines plane in the nation's capital was the deadliest U.S. passenger air crash in over two decades.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators are investigating the crash site, and the FAA said it will assist with the probe.\n\nSearch for missing cockpit recorder\n\nIt took \"a slight right turn, followed by a slight left turn and then a steep descent,\" leading to its crash, NTSB investigator Ralph Hicks said in a press briefing Saturday.\n\n\"This was a high-impact crash and the plane is highly fragmented, ​​​​​​​​​​​​NTSB chairman Jennifer Homendy said at the briefing.\n\nAs a result, there is a lot of debris, much of which investigators are looking to collect. The collection effort could take weeks, Homendy said.\n\nWhile investigators have found the plane's two engines, they have yet to find the cockpit voice recorder. She urged anyone who found debris to email the NTSB (witness@ntsb.gov).\n\nAbout the cockpit recorder, which may not be intact, Homendy said, \"hopefully, once we can find it … we can take that back to our lab and evaluate it.\"\n\nFinding the recorder is \"critical, so we can hear what's happening in the cockpit,\" she said. \"However, it doesn't mean that we can't continue our investigation and complete it (without the voice recorder). We can. It's just a piece of our investigation that gives us more information.\"\n\nPoliticians respond to the disaster\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro thanked federal officials for help investigating the crash and stressed a message of unity in the face of tragedy.\n\n\"This is not just a group of emergency response professionals working together at the state, local and federal level, this is neighbors working together to look out for one another,\" he said Saturday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday night applauded first responders and offered his condolences to the victims in a Truth Social post.\n\n\"So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost,\" Trump wrote. \"Our people are totally engaged. First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job. More to follow. God Bless you all.\"\n\nPhiladelphia air traffic control tried to reach doomed plane\n\nAir traffic control communications reveal the moments when controllers tried to reach the doomed jet.\n\nThe Medevac pilot did not mention any issues over the radio, but the air traffic control tower caught on that something was wrong.\n\n“Medevac med service zero-five-six, northeast tower, are you on frequency?” a controller asks almost four minutes after the jet's takeoff from Northeast Philadelphia Airport in an audio file downloaded from liveatc.net.\n\nMinutes later another voice came on: What's going on down there?\"\n\n\"We have a lost aircraft,\" the operator responds.\n\nRead more.\n\nCrews inspect crash site\n\nAdam Thiel, managing director of the City of Philadelphia, said crews are conducting house-to-house operations around the area of the crash to find any hidden damage. It could be days, he said, before the full extent of the tragedy is known.\n\nHe estimated the area of impact to be roughly four to six blocks wide. But debris also spread into areas farther away.\n\nPhiladelphia fire officials said five homes were set ablaze, but they had since been extinguished. Officials did not say how many cars were impacted.\n\nWhat is a Medevac jet?\n\nShort for “medical evacuation,” Medevac flights are undertaken by aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, including ventilators, defibrillators, and monitoring devices along with caregivers to provide inflight care for patients being transported to a medical facility, according to aviation news site Simple Flying.\n\nStaffed by specially trained medical personnel, the aircraft are \"essentially flying ambulances,\" according to Fly REVA, an international air ambulance provider with bases of operation in Arizona, Florida, New York and Puerto Rico.\n\nHelicopters can be used as Medevac aircraft, but fixed-wing planes such as the Learjet are ideal for use because they can take off and land on shorter airfields. Large cargo doors allow for loading and unloading of a stretcher, the site says.\n\nMedical crew on a Medevac can include intensive care physicians, flight doctors and flight nurses, notes Medical Air Service Worldwide, an air ambulance provider with offices in New York and London.\n\nEquipment on an Medevac flight may include a satellite phone, an intensive care unit, respirator, defibrillator, blood gas analyzer and oxygen tanks, the company says.\n\nPilots may have additional medical training including infection control and patient loading and unloading, according to MedicTests, an evaluation site.\n\n– Mike Snider\n\nChild aboard plane was in Philadelphia for treatment\n\nJet Rescue was contracted to transport the child from Philadelphia to Tijuana, Mexico, Gold said. Gold confirmed a third-party charitable organization paid for the flight, but he couldn’t divulge the name of the organization.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the families,” Gold said. “It’s really an irreplaceable loss.”\n\nShriner's Hospital Philadelphia said they had been treating the girl and celebrated her with a sendoff Friday before the flight, according to an interview a hospital representative gave to CBS3 in Philadelphia.\n\nThe company previously experienced a fatal crash in 2023 in Mexico where five crew members were lost, Gold said.\n\nThe LearJet 55 is one of the largest available and Jet Rescue is among the few air ambulance companies that use them because they are expensive, but an “exceptionally reliable jet.” Jet Rescue flies 600 to 700 flights a year around the world and that the number of trips the LearJet 55 took the five days before the crash is not unusual, Gold said.\n\nHe added that the company training for its crew exceeds the industry standard, the airplanes in its fleet are “well-maintained” and safety is taken extremely seriously, calling each flight a “holy mission.”\n\n“Every flight is like it’s the first flight we ever did,” Gold said. “IF a red light goes on in the cockpit, the plane is grounded no matter where it is.”\n\n'Help us, help us'\n\nPhiladelphia resident Michael Hitchner was sitting in a parked car when the plane crashed nearby. He said he used his shirt to try to stop the bleeding from a child's head who was injured from debris that fell through a car windshield.\n\n\"The parents were shouting, 'Help us, help us, help us!'\" Hitchner said. He added that he and his wife saw other carnage as well. \"My wife saw a disembodied foot. I saw a disembodied arm. I saw medical supplies scattered everywhere,\" Hitchner said.\n\n\"It was a very shocking and disturbing experience, seeing everything that happened. I got home. I threw up twice.\"\n\n– Jim Walsh\n\nWhat does the National Transportation Safety Board do?\n\nThe NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating civil transportation accidents in the U.S. involving aircraft, railways, roads and on the water, according to the NTSB website.\n\nThe agency, headed by a five-member board, is currently investigating the midair collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday.\n\nHow many planes have crashed in 2025?\n\nSo far in the U.S. there have been eight airplane crashes – including bird strikes and single craft accidents – based on information from the Aviation Safety Network.\n\nPrior to the crash of a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday, there had been no fatalities in the U.S. this year.\n\nThat crash left 67 dead. With the fatalities in the Philadelphia crash, there's now been 74 air crash-related deaths in the U.S. in 2025.\n\n'No donations' needed, mayor says\n\nMayor Parker urged those looking for ways to help victims of the tragedy to pray for the City of Philadelphia and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. She stressed that \"no donations are needed at this time,\" during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nShe said officials were working on creating \"formal, actionable ways\" for people to assist with the tragedy.\n\nDetails about plane emerge\n\nAccording to the online flight-tracking service Flight Aware, the red and white plane is a 43-year-old Learjet 55 registered to Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, which has operations in Miami and Mexico.\n\nIn recent days, the plane had passed through airports in Mexico, Haiti, Florida and Arizona. On the company's website, the plane is featured in a video explaining how Jet Rescue can extract patients worldwide and is shown in the air as the video touts the company's \"impeccable safety record.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Jet Rescue for comment.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes and Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY; Jim Walsh, USA TODAY Network; Bucks County Courier Times; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/19/trump-executive-order-actions-inauguration-president/77692342007/", "title": "Trump preps 100 executive actions. Here's what could be coming.", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump intends to start his second White House term with a bang through a flurry of executive orders and directives that leave no doubt a major transformation is underway.\n\n\"Shock and awe,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., recently predicted after Republicans members of Congress received a preview of the activity to come.\n\nConvinced he has an election \"mandate\" from American voters, Trump is planning to surpass the century mark in executive actions over his first few days of office after getting sworn in as the 47th president on Monday ‒ a moment he's called a \"liberation day for America.\"\n\n\"There will be over 100 executive actions ‒ commands to the bureaucracies to change their ways,\" Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, told Fox News last week.\n\nThe orders will bypass Congress to undo President Joe Biden's policies ranging from climate to diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce while carrying out Trump's campaign promises to secure the southern border, expand domestic energy production and target transgender Americans.\n\nMany of the actions will be controversial and draw protests from Democrats and others on the political left. Some orders, particularly involving immigration, are expected to invite lawsuits.\n\nIt could be a busy few days and weeks of signatures from Trump, who has also also promised \"major pardons\" for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHere's a look at some of the executive actions that Trump and his top advisers have signaled the incoming president might take:\n\nReinstating Title 42\n\nOn the immigration front, Trump has talked about a series of orders he would issue on \"Day 1\" to seal the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have in recent weeks fallen to record lows.\n\nThat includes executive action to revive Title 42 authority to quickly expel asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTitle 42 is an emergency public health law that both the Trump and Biden administrations used during the COVID pandemic to justify turning back migrants and asylum-seekers who crossed the border illegally. Biden ended the policy in 2023.\n\nWhat the incoming Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nMass deportations\n\nOne of Trump's signatures campaign promises is to carry out \"mass deportations\" of immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nTo carry out his sweeping plans, Trump has suggested he would expand the authority of immigration agents and use the U.S. military. The expected moves have already generated pushback from Democrats.\n\nEnding birthright citizenship\n\nTrump has also promised to end birthright citizenship on Day 1 of his presidency ‒ and will do so through executive action \"if we can\" ‒ likely setting up a constitutional legal fight.\n\nBirthright citizenship refers to anyone born in the U.S. being considering a U.S. citizen based on the 14th Amendment, which says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\nIf he decides he can't end birthright citizenship through executive action because of constitutional constraints, Trump would seemingly have to pursue an amendment to the Constitution, which would require support from two-thirds of Congress and ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nBorder wall and empowering local law enforcement\n\nTrump has promised to restart construction of the border fence at the U.S.-Mexico border, an original staple of his first term policy agenda that the Biden administration halted.\n\nAbout 452 miles of barriers along the southern border were constructed during Trump's presidency, but only 40 miles of wall were placed where a barrier didn't previously exist.\n\nTrump advisers also have signaled plans to direct the federal government to more aggressively use 287(g) ‒ a federal program that empowers local law enforcement to carry out some immigration enforcement duties.\n\nTrump turned to the federal program often in his first term. Biden campaigned on ending the Trump-era agreements during his 2020 campaign. Although Biden did not embrace the program at the same level as Trump, immigration activists have accused Biden of not fulfilling his original pledge.\n\nTariffs\n\nTrump has promised major new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China on his first day in office.\n\nThree weeks after his election victory, Trump said one of his first executive orders would be to sign all the necessary paperwork to levy a 25% tariff on all products arriving from Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump said he plans to levy an additional 10% tariff on top of existing tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States.\n\nHe's said the tariffs on goods from the neighboring country's are in response to \"thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\"\n\nTikTok\n\nWith a ban on TikTok going into effect over the weekend, Trump said he plans to issue a Day 1 executive order to ensure the wildly popular social media app can continue to operate.\n\nTrump on Sunday said he will issue an order extending the period before the sell-or-ban TikTok law goes into effect \"so we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nAfter going dark in the U.S. on Saturday, TikTok responded to Trump's commitment with a statement that said it is \"in the process of restoring service.\" TikTok thanked Trump for providing \"clarity and assurance\" to service providers that they won't face penalties for making the platform available.\n\nBiden signed bipartisan legislation in April banning TikTok if Beijing-based parent company ByteDance did not sell off its U.S. assets by Sunday. Biden cited national security concerns with the app ‒ which some fear the Chinese government could exploit to gain access to private user data or spread misinformation.\n\nAlthough Trump now wants to keep TikTok operating, he tried to ban TikTok by executive order in 2020 during his first term.\n\n'Drill, baby, drill' agenda\n\nTrump, who campaigned on a mantra of \"drill, baby, drill,\" is expected to take multiple executive actions aimed at fulfilling his pro-oil agenda to boost the production of domestic energy, even as it's already at an all-time high.\n\nTrump has promised to swiftly overturn Biden's recent action to ban offshore drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. He also wants to reopen drilling for oil in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAmong several moves expected in the energy sector, the incoming president has said he will create a new National Energy Council to \"oversee the path to U.S. energy dominance.\" The new council will be led by former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's nominee for secretary of the Department of Interior. But how the council will be structured, staffed and operate hasn't been detailed.\n\nEliminating the 'electric vehicle mandate'\n\nTrump has talked repeatedly about eliminating Biden's so-called \"electric vehicle mandate,\" referring to an Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires auto manufacturers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half in new light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning in 2027.\n\nThe EPA estimates that auto manufacturers may choose to build electric vehicles for about 30% to 56% of their new light-duty vehicles by 2032 and 20% to 32% of new medium duty vehicles.\n\nBiden has used the federal government to accelerate the transition to clean-energy electric vehicles. Trump has pledged to undo the efforts.\n\nEnding natural gas export ban\n\nTrump has said he will take executive action to end the Biden administration's pause on issuing new permits for projects aimed at exporting liquified natural gas.\n\nLike the emissions guidelines, it's among several rules issued by the Biden administration to combat climate change, which Trump has called a \"hoax.\"\n\nA Louisiana federal judge in July ruled the Biden administration cannot halt issuing permits for such projects. The Justice Department appealed the decision.\n\n'Transgender lunacy'\n\nTrump has promised first-day action taking aim at rights for transgender people, including making it the official policy of the U.S. government to recognize only two genders: males and females.\n\n\"With the stroke of my pen, on Day 1, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech last month in Phoenix.\n\nTrump said he will sign executive orders to end \"child sexual mutilation,\" get transgender people out of the military and public schools, and to keep athletes born male biologically from participating in women's sports.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted Tuesday to pass a bill that would ban transgender women and girls from participating in women's and girls' school sports, but it's unclear if the legislation can garner 60 Senate votes and eventually make it to Trump's desk for signature into law.\n\nDEI in the federal government\n\nTrump has signaled he will take action to overturn Biden-era policies aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, in the federal government.\n\n\"I'll end all of the Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government immediately,\" Trump said last month.\n\nDEI in business and government has become a top target of Republicans. In his first year in the White House, Biden signed an executive order that established procedures to ensure diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility are priorities in building the federal workforce.\n\nIn-person work for federal employees\n\nTrump and his top advisers have signaled possible executive action directing federal employees to return to working in-person.\n\n\"He's going to bring workers back to their offices,\" Miller said. \"He's going to end the travesty in which federal workers are pretending to work but are not actually working. They're at home watching Netflix while you're paying their salaries.\"\n\nTrump has said he will fire any federal employees who don't physically return to their offices once his new administration begins. He also pledged to challenge in court a Biden agreement allowing Social Security Administration employees to work remotely.\n\nWork-from-home policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic remain in place for some federal workers.\n\nEnd funding to 'radical left NGOs'\n\nMiller said Trump will take action to stop federal funding for \"radical left NGOs,\" though he did not specify which entities would be targeted.\n\nNGOs, or non-governmental operations, refers to nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding.\n\nBiden used executive authority to overturn a Trump executive order for a so-called \"global gag rule\" that prevented federal aid from going to foreign organizations that provide abortion services or information.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/politics/border-surge-immigration", "title": "Record-breaking surge of migrants anticipated at the US-Mexico ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAnother record-breaking surge of migrants may attempt to cross the US-Mexico border this spring, alarming officials who are now rushing to build more facilities and lining up prison buses to help accommodate the new arrivals.\n\nThe head of the US Border Patrol says he’s getting ready for as many as 8,000 people to be apprehended daily, more than double the daily number of the 2019 surge under the Trump administration.\n\nThat staggering number “will probably become the norm over the next 30 to 45 days,” Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz told CNN in an exclusive interview. There have already been 940,000 arrests this fiscal year, which started in October.\n\nThe projections paint a grim outlook for the Biden administration just months from a politically contentious midterm election and as the administration tries to project a welcoming message to refugees amid the war in Ukraine.\n\nBorder arrests ebb and flow regardless of who is in the Oval Office. But deteriorating conditions in Latin America that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic are among the factors that have contributed to people wanting to migrate to the United States. That’s already put President Joe Biden in a precarious position following a surge of unaccompanied migrant children last spring and the abrupt arrival of thousands of primarily Haitian migrants last September.\n\nOfficials have assessed those surges to better respond to future upticks in migrants and leverage agencies across the government to assist in the event of more arrivals, like the Bureau of Prisons which can provide vehicles for the transportation of migrants from the border to facilities for intake.\n\n“We’re managing a flow that’s significant,” Ortiz told CNN. “As I get to, you know, 7,000 to 7,500 a day average, that’s going to put additional strain.”\n\nOver the course of the last year, Border Patrol has at times faced 8,000 encounters a day.\n\nInternal documents have shown estimates of how many people are within hours or days of the US-Mexico border who might plan to migrate to the United States, according to a source familiar with discussions. The Department of Homeland Security has set up a “Southwest Border Coordination Center” at its headquarters to coordinate across multiple agencies.\n\nBut as officials prepare for potential mass migration to the US southern border, some sectors are already feeling the strain. In Del Rio, Texas, agents faced groups of hundreds of migrants turning themselves over to agents for six consecutive days. Facilities across the border are over capacity already and held over 16,000 migrants on Tuesday morning, Ortiz told CNN.\n\nFuture of Title 42\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Raul L. Ortiz speaks to the media in Del Rio, Texas, on Sunday, September 19, 2021. Eric Gay/AP\n\nFor two years, border authorities have relied on a public health authority, known as Title 42, to swiftly expel migrants, including asylum seekers, encountered at the US-Mexico border, an unprecedented departure from traditional protocols. Despite mounting pressure and scrutiny from Biden’s allies, the administration has continued to rely on the authority.\n\nAs the pandemic landscape evolves, discussions about terminating that order have picked up speed, sources tell CNN. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to release its latest assessment of the authority in the coming days.\n\nSenate Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called on the administration to do away with the public health authority.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Political theater': National Guardsman on Abbott's border operation 03:36 - Source: CNN 'Political theater': National Guardsman on Abbott's border operation 03:36\n\n“As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxes it domestic COVID-19 protocols, it is perplexing that the agency continues to recommend the extended use of this draconian policy at the border, contradicting the overwhelming signs of America’s pandemic recovery under President Biden’s leadership,” Sens. Schumer, Bob Menendez, Alex Padilla, and Cory Booker said in a recent statement.\n\nIf the public health order is terminated, the administration would return to traditional protocols which might include releasing migrants into the US while they go through their immigration proceedings, detaining migrants, or removing them if they don’t have an asylum claim.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration announced a new federal regulation that would shorten the process for migrants making an asylum claim, though it’s not expected to take effect until the summer and will be a slow ramp up.\n\nThe change in demographics has been an ongoing challenge for an agency built to address single adult males. Border facilities – akin to jail-like conditions – are not equipped to care for families and children who’ve arrived at the border without their parents, especially in such large numbers, prompting a need for additional facilities.\n\nThe Border Patrol uses soft-sided facilities for processing migrants in select locations along the US-Mexico border. But in anticipation of more people, the agency is planning to expand the current footprint of those facilities in Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas, Ortiz said.\n\nThere are also ongoing discussions about so-called joint processing centers – a new concept where multiple agencies work together to intake migrants. The locations of those centers have not been determined.\n\n“We have, I think, improved conditions across the board. We just need additional capacity and that’s part of why the academy is so important, why our processing coordinators are so important because we want to balance it out against out border security,” Ortiz said, citing the Border Patrol Academy where agents get training before deploying to the field.\n\nAsked about whether the administration plans to offer Covid-19 vaccines to migrants, Ortiz said those discussions are ongoing.\n\nThis month, 126 agents graduated from the Border Patrol Academy, including 35 agents this week who will soon be deployed to the field. Even so, the Department of Homeland Security is seeking more help within its workforce. DHS Deputy Secretary John Tien recently asked department personnel to volunteer at the US-Mexico border in an email sent to the workforce.\n\nBorder Patrol also detailed 350 additional Border Patrol agents to assist at the US southern border and another 150 agents are helping with processing remotely. The Chief said he also plans to lean on groups, like Jose Andres’ World Central Kitchen and the Red Cross, for aid.\n\n“I want to continue those types of relationships, because that’s a big part of our strategy is making sure one that you know, we can do everything we can to secure the border, but we can’t do it by ourselves,” Ortiz said. “We have to work with our communities and partners and everyone else out there.”", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/01/northeast-philadelphia-plane-crash-investigation-continues-roosevelt-mall-learjet-aviation-accident/78113324007/", "title": "Northeast Philadelphia plane crash investigation continues", "text": "An investigation into the fiery crash of a medical flight in Northeast Philadelphia continued Saturday with the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board on the scene to search for answers to why the Learjet fell from the sky Friday night.\n\nSix Mexican nationals were on board the Jet Rescue flight when it left Northeast Philadelphia Airport and within a minute crashed near Roosevelt Mall at Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard, an always busy hub of activity with dozens of businesses and hundreds of homes.\n\nThe pilots and passengers on board were all confirmed dead Saturday morning. City officials also confirmed one person on the ground was killed and 19 people were injured but cautioned those numbers could rise.\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the residents of Northeast Philadelphia saw \"carnage in their communities, saw fuselage, saw destruction and saw things no one should ever have to experience in their neighborhoods\" when they woke up and left their homes after the crash Saturday.\n\nIn addition to the injuries on the ground, homes and cars were set ablaze when the Learjet 55 crashed in a massive, fiery explosion sending parts of the plane and other debris far and wide.\n\nThe medical flight included the pilots, a medical crew and a little girl, who had been treated at Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was given a sendoff earlier Friday for her return trip to Mexico, the hospital said. Her mother was also on the plane.\n\nPieces of the plane were still on the ground Saturday morning as the sun came up and the city got its first daytime look at the devastation in the area, including on Rupert Street, Calvert Street, the boulevard and Cottman Avenue. At least six burned-out cars and shredded pieces of the plane remained Saturday morning among the debris in a cordoned-off area on Cottman near Rupert Street, close to the spot of impact.\n\nThe crash in Philadelphia comes in the wake of the midair collision outside of Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people. The collision of an Army helicopter and American Airlines plane in the nation's capital was the deadliest U.S. passenger air crash in over two decades, USA TODAY reported. Investigation of that crash is continuing.\n\nCheck back for live updates throughout the day:\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said the cockpit voice recorder remains missing from the plane crash scene.\n\nThese devices, commonly referred to as \"black boxes,\" are often in fact orange, according to Homendy.

Chairman Jennifer Homendy is to be the speaker.\n\nResidents describe shake and sound of NE Philly plane crash\n\nAndre Gary thought the world was ending when he saw the jet sputter over his head outside of a Macy’s in Roosevelt Mall. He saw and heard the deadly crash in real time on Cottman Avenue on Friday night.“I still don’t know how I feel about it, it was just crazy.”Along the residential St. Vincent Street, police and media buzzed around while residents went about their regular Saturdays, shaken up by the prior evening's plane crash.Abdellah Rays said he felt the whole house shake and echoed the same stressed confusion others have. “We heard a big blast,” he said.At the corner of Bustleton and Cottman avenues, yards away from the debris, people gathered to get a glimpse of the wreckage.Andre Boldin said the plane sounded like a missile as it sputtered overhead. “Confusion, like what the hell is going on?” he said.\n\nJohn Schwartz thought we might have been under attack on Friday night when he saw the sky turn red from his house less than a mile away from the crash site.“I think then I saw the fireball over top of the houses, and I just went right out of the house and went to see what's going on,” he said. He said the response was immediate from Philadelphia first responders.\n\n5 homes set ablaze in Philadelphia plane crash\n\nThe fireball that ignited when the medical flight crashed to the ground sent fiery debris into the neighborhood next to the shopping center where it crashed. Philadelphia fire officials said five homes were set ablaze, but that crews had all fire now extinguished. Shelter was set up for impacted residents.\n\nOfficials did not say how many cars were impacted by the fire, but there is a lot of ground to cover.\n\n“The area of impact — that area is roughly four to six blocks, and we also have debris in remote areas where something happened with the aircraft,” city Managing Director Adam Thiel said.\n\nProperty damage is still being investigated.\n\nIf anyone in the area has any kind of debris on their car, then they should call 911. Officials said there is a possibility residents may find debris outside the immediate crash area.\n\n1 dead on ground in Northeast Philly plane crash; 6 dead on plane\n\nAuthorities updated the investigation of the Jet Rescue crash at about 11 a.m. Saturday, saying that seven have died and about 19 others have been injured but there could be others.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker stressed that the investigation into the plane crash on Cottman Avenue is ongoing, and asked people in the area to stay home unless they have to leave. She said people will have no problem accessing their homes if their road is closed or under investigation.\n\nShe confirmed the six deaths on the plane, and said there was an additional death of a person who was in their car when the medical flight fell to the ground in a fiery explosion. She did not identify any victims.\n\n\"At least one other person perished,\" Parker said of the fatality on the ground, confirming for the first time a death not associated with those on the plane. Six Mexican nationals died on the plane.\n\nCity Managing Director Adam Thiel said it is a \"fluid\" situation and those causality numbers could go up.\n\n\"It will likely be days or more until we are able to definitively answer the question about the number of folks who perish in this tragedy and the outcome for those who are injured right now, I would certainly echo please pray for all those affected by otherwise,\" he said.\n\nParker thanked first responders and said crews and investigators worked through the night and will continue to work to learn what happened.\n\n\"But I want to be clear that we will find a cause for this tragedy,\" Parker said.\n\nParker also asked Philadelphians and others not to come to the site, saying investigators need to be able to work the large scene uninterrupted. \"Do not come to the site right now,\" she said.\n\nShe stressed that there is no formal donation fund has been set up by the city or any other organization at this point. She said no donations are necessary, and that she wouldn't donate to a GoFundMe or other kinds of social media yet.\n\n\"We appreciate everyone's desire to help, and if anything changes, we will let you know,\" she said.\n\nPA governor says Philadelphia has full support, resources to investigate plane crash\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro underscored the holistic effort between the federal, state and local government at Saturday's press conference. He said he has been in contact with Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy since the crash. He also thanked the people working on the ground.\n\n\"This is not just a group of emergency response professionals working together at the state, local and federal level,\" Shapiro said. \"This is neighbors working together to look out for one another.\"\n\nNortheast Philadelphia Airport tower: 'We have a lost aircraft'\n\nClues regarding the cause of a plane crash in the Northeast on Friday night weren't evident in recorded air traffic control communications.\n\nBut, the communications caught when traffic control knew there was a problem.\n\n“Medevac med service zero-five-six, northeast tower, are you on frequency?” a controller asks almost four minutes after takeoff from Northeast Philadelphia Airport. A request for response from the aircraft is repeated by the controller.\n\nAbout five minutes later, another voice comes on the radio asking, \"What's going on down there?\"\n\n\"We have a lost aircraft. We're not exactly sure what happened, so we're trying to figure it out. For now, the field is going to be closed, so no inbounds or outbounds probably,\" the operator responds.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has announced that it will be investigating the crash alongside the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor releases new statement on deadly jet crash\n\nWhile the scheduled news conference is delayed, Mayor Cherelle Parker released a new statement on X around 10 a.m. She and other officials have yet to confirm whether there were fatalities on the ground, but there were injuries.\n\n\"This is a tragedy in our city,\" the mayor wrote. \" People have lost their lives and many injured in this horrific crash and the damage is significant.\"\n\nShe said she was grateful for the \"rapid response\" of first responders. Her message came just after officials confirmed the deaths of the six people on the plane.\n\nMexican president confirms deaths on medevec plane\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the deaths of the six Mexican nationals on the plane.\n\n\"I regret the death of six Mexicans in the plane crash in Philadelphia, United States. The consular authorities are in permanent contact with the families; I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to support them in whatever way is required. My solidarity with their loved ones and friends,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday morning.\n\nThe pediatric patient and her mother were traveling home to Mexico after the little girl received treatment at Shriners. Hospital officials didn't disclose how long she had been in the United States or what she was being treated for. Four crew members were also on the plane, officials have said.\n\nAuthorities to give update on Northeast Philadelphia medevec crash\n\nAuthorities are set to gather at the massive crash scene, where debris and impacts spanned nearly a quarter-mile from where the jet fell to the ground, to update the investigation Saturday morning. They spoke not far from the large crater off Cottman Avenue where the medevec crashed shortly after 6:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nWho was on the Jet Rescue flight that crashed in Philadelphia?\n\nJet Rescue spokesman Shai Gold confirmed late Friday that all six people aboard the jet were Mexican nationals including a child patient, the child’s mother, a flight doctor and paramedic, pilot and co-pilot.\n\nThe company was contracted to transport the child from Philadelphia to Tijuana, Mexico, Gold said, but he could not provide any personal information about the child including an age or how long she was in Philadelphia receiving treatment.\n\nGold confirmed that a third-party charitable organization paid for the flight, but he didn’t provide the name of the organization. “Our heart goes out to the families,” Gold said. “It’s really an irreplaceable loss.”\n\nShriners Children’s said the child was given a special sendoff celebration hours before the crash.\n\n\"Shriners Children is heartbroken to confirm that one of our pediatric patients and the child’s mother were aboard the Jet Rescue Air Ambulance that crashed in Philadelphia this evening.

So, we worked on our counter punches,\" Surace said after the career altering victory. \"He is a true warrior. I want to thank him for the opportunity. This was a big experience for me.\"\n\nSurace survived the first knock down of his career in Round 2, which came courtesy of a strong left hook from Munguia, who was beginning to establish control. Munguia had dictated the spacing in the ring, backing Surace into the ropes consistently. But as the fight continued, Surace grew more comfortable with Munguia's pressure, culminating in the knockout of the year contender.\n\nEarlier this week, the WBC mandated a fight between top contender Christian Mbilli and Munguia, but prospects of that bout were quickly dashed by Surace's cracking right hand. Surace is currently unranked by all four sanctioning bodies, something which may soon change after a career-best win.\n\n“Middleweight is my true weight class,\" Surace said. \"But we’ll see if (a rematch) can happen.”\n\nIn the co-main event, Alan David Picasso dismantled last minute replacement Yehison Cuello with a third-round body shot knockout. After controlling the first two rounds, Picasso landed a thudding left hand to the body of Cuello which dropped him to the canvas, where the referee would subsequently count him out.\n\nPicasso is reportedly the top option to face pound-for-pound great Naoya Inoue next year in his highly anticipated U.S. return.\n\nCheck below for updates from throughout the Munguia vs. Surace fight card.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace fight card results\n\nBruno Surace def.

Munguia continues to press forward, but he hasn't been able to land as cleanly as these past couple rounds. Surace taking what damage Munguia is dealing well. Out of nowhere Surace catches Munguia with a thumping overhand right and sends Munguia to the canvas! Munguia looks out of it and as he tries to pick himself up, the referee counts him out and waives the fight! Surace pulls off the stunning upset by stoppage!\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace: Round 5\n\nSurace not doing a great job of staying off the ropes, but when he's found himself there this round, he's done well to punch his way out of pressure. Munguia letting quick combinations go with Surace on the back foot, but not much is getting through Surace's guard to land cleanly. Better round for Surace, although it was largely controlled by Munguia.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace: Round 4\n\nSurace looked to land a solid overhand right early, but it's not long before Munguia has him back against the ropes, unloading power punches. Munguia consistently going down to the body of Surace, landing often but Surace has taken the shots well. In the final minute, Surace catches Munguia and seems to maybe briefly shake him, but Munguia continued sending shots Surace's way as the round closed out.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace: Round 3\n\nMunguia trying to capitalize on the momentum of last round, backing Surace against the ropes, looking to let his hands go. Surace is trying to fight his way out of pressure, but keeps finding himself up against the ropes where Munguia is teeing off on him. Munguia got caught a couple times late in the round, but is in full control of the fight through three.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace: Round 2\n\nSurace stepping inside to unload quick shots early on, but not landing anything significant. Moments later, Munguia lands a strong left hook and sends Surace to the canvas for the first time in his career! Surace beats the count but has over 90 seconds to survive. Surace up and looks to have recovered, throwing some punches in response now. Surace makes it out of the round but nervous moments for the Frenchman, as Munguia takes the round, 10-8.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace: Round 1\n\nThis is Munguia's fourth fight of 2024 and second since losing to Canelo in May, while Surace steps into his first fight outside of France having not fought since last December. Slow start to the fight as Surace throws in the occasional straight shot, while Munguia uses his feet to move around the ring. Munguia on the front foot but not too many connects coming from the former champion; he closed out the final seconds of the round well though.\n\nJaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace fight card live updates\n\nOne fight until Jaime Munguia vs Bruno Surace\n\nA \"swing bout\" between Jose Luis Rodriguez and Axel Adrian Campos, originally planned for after the main event, has been flexed in to fill time ahead of the Munguia vs. Surace fight.\n\nThe main event will begin shortly after this four-round junior lightweight bout.\n\nAlan David Picasso vs Yehison Cuello: Round 3\n\nPicasso working his way inside and letting his hands go once there, targeting both the body and head of Cuello. Cuello hardly throwing his jab so far, strictly unloading power punches, which haven't fazed Picasso. Picasso lands a clean left-handed body shot on Cuello with just over a minute remaining and Cuello drops to the canvas! Cuello looks hurt and can't beat the count! Picasso secures a 17th career stoppage victory and sets himself up for an Inoue fight next year with the win.\n\nAlan David Picasso vs Yehison Cuello: Round 2\n\nPicasso letting his hands go a bit more early in the round, stepping to Cuello and shooting sharp punches. Picasso doing lots of work behind the jab, which has been effective in putting Cuello on the back foot. Straight shots have landed well for Picasso this round, who looks comfortable against the late replacement.\n\nAlan David Picasso vs Yehison Cuello: Round 1\n\nWith a win, Picasso will reportedly set himself up for a U.S. showdown against pound-for-pound great Naoya Inoue next year. Cuello steps in as a last-minute replacement for Isaac Sackey, having last fought in September, suffering a TKO defeat. Picasso is the much taller man in the ring and is using his reach advantage to control the distance, stepping inside on his terms. Cuello releasing short bursts of punches on the inside, but not connecting with much success in the opening round.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 10\n\nGarcia just has to survive these final three minutes and he should see his hand raised. Abdukakhorov lands a strong punch to open the round, but it'll take a lot more to stop Garcia, who's shown a good chin so far. Now it's Abdukakhorov who's landing the best shots, while Garcia isn't taking a step back and responds with some solid punches of his own shortly after. Abdukakhorov had a solid round, but Garcia should take a comfortable decision.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 9\n\nAbdukakhorov's only chance at this point seems to be a knockout, which looks unlikely given how Garcia's handled his best punches. Abdukakhorov has used his feet more in the second half of the fight, but it hasn't done too much to stunt Garcia's pressure. Garcia stacking some solid connects in the final minute, which seem to be wearing Abdukakhorov down. Garcia in full control at the moment, landing a handful of heavy punches as the bell sounds.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 8\n\nAbdukakhorov has begun to up his output again, but it doesn't look like there's much behind his punches. Garcia continues on the front foot and hasn't been quite as successful countering Abdukakhorov's punches this round, but has had moments. In the final minute the referee pauses the bout after a low blow from Garcia, which he warned about prior to the round, and ultimately deducts a point from Garcia. Other than the point deduction, Garcia controlled the round.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 7\n\nThe body shots from Garcia have been landing consistently, even more so as the fight has gone on. Abdukakhorov opening up more this round, giving Garcia chances to land, while not landing much himself thus far. Garcia has hardly taken a step back this round and is building a sizeable lead in the fight.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 6\n\nGarcia letting his hands go to open the round, going down low on Abdukakhorov and landing. Garcia is on the front foot, taking the fight to Abdukakhorov, walking through his opponent's counters. Whether it's because of the punches coming at him or his gas tank, Abdukakhorov hasn't been as active this round.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 5\n\nBoth fighters trading leather at close range early in the round, each connecting, but Garcia seems to be landing the more significant shots. Abdukakhorov has landed his fair share of punches but Garcia is shaking off every shot so far. Good action from each fighter, but Garcia is looking the more comfortable of the two.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 4\n\nGarcia doing well early in the round to counter off of Abdukakhorov's forward pressure. Abdukakhorov get a warning midway through the round for a punch to the back of Garcia's head. Abdukakhorov getting increasingly caught by Garcia on the counter as he attempts to connect on some big punches himself. Garcia beginning to gain some real momentum.\n\nJorge Garcia vs Kudratillo Abdukakhorov: Round 3\n\nGarcia standing in the pocket and fielding lots of pressure from Abdukakhorov, looking for openings to land his own shot cleanly. Abdukakhorov's pressure has resulted in some solid connects but nothing that's worrying Garcia. In the final minute, Garcia shakes Abdukakhorov with a strong shot and looks to pile on the pressure with his opponent visibly damaged.

This artist is ...", "text": "TECATE, Mexico — On a November morning in this quiet border city in the Sierra de Juarez mountains, Enrique Chiu sketches Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of knowledge, on the ribbed, rusted metal fence that separates one nation from another.\n\nChildren have gathered to help him decorate the deity, who is part-snake, part-bird, on this section of the wall. On other parts of the fence, in border cities like Tijuana and Mexicali, artists, residents and students have also volunteered to paint.\n\n\"Nobody likes the wall, so I'm going to use it like a canvas,\" Chiu said.\n\nAs the Trump administration pushes forward on the president's pledge to build a \"big, beautiful\" new border wall, Chiu, a Mexican-born, American-educated artist is working to turn the old one into a masterpiece.\n\nChiu launched his project, called the Mural of Brotherhood, last December, after Trump was elected on a platform of nationalist politics and widespread anti-immigrant sentiments. The U.S. is now testing prototype designs for the new wall, which Trump insists Mexico will pay for, despite repeated refusals from Mexican leaders. As relations between the two countries have soured, support for Chiu’s mural has grown.\n\nSince Election Day, Chiu has enlisted more than 2,600 volunteers to paint uplifting messages on the Mexico-facing side of the U.S.-owned fence. Once completed, the mural should stretch more than a mile in Tijuana and shorter spans in Tecate, Mexicali, Ciudad Juarez, Naco and Reynosa – potentially setting the Guinness World Record for longest mural.\n\nThe murals spread messages of peace to people crossing the border by car or on foot, Chiu said. They're also intended to be a final glimpse of hope for migrants risking danger as they cross northward.\n\nBut in these border cities, the images are also a way for people who remain in Mexico to feel connected to those on the other side. In Tecate, some of the people painting the wall were separated from family in nearby California; others had been deported and were adjusting to their new lives.\n\n\"Many of the children have families on the other side of the border line,\" Tecate teacher Isis Jacqueline Lara Rodriguez said in Spanish. Her class of fifth graders participated in the mural event.\n\n\"Painting is a way of leaving their mark on the wall,\" she said.\n\nThat morning in Tecate, Chiu wore a utility vest and a wide hat to protect himself against the strong desert sun. As he and his volunteers painted, a line of cars moved swiftly across the city's port of entry, which is quieter than others in the region.\n\nFor those passengers, the border art might seem like a reflection of the local culture.\n\nThe mountainous city is unique among Baja California border communities: Rather than being industrial or overly touristic, Tecate is known for being the home of its namesake beer and offering spas, ranch resorts and lots of outdoor activities.\n\nBut for people crossing by foot, the mural will also serve as a directory, alerting people to where to find food and medical services, Chiu said.\n\nChiu frames his own migration story as one of opportunity.\n\nHe was born in Guadalajara and crossed the border with his mother when he was eight. He lived in Los Angeles, without legal status, for one year before returning to Mexico. He later attended California State University, Long Beach on a student visa and remained in the U.S. for 12 years.\n\n\"When I was living there, I was living the American dream,\" Chiu said. \"I went to school, I had my business, I had my house, my gallery, my studio, three cars. I had everything there.\"\n\nHe moved to Tijuana about ten years ago and joined the burgeoning artistic scene. Within a couple of years, he again owned a house, business and gallery – this time in Mexico.\n\n\"You can live the American dream here, too, and you can do whatever you want,\" he said.\n\nAs Chiu paints murals on the south side of the border fence, the Trump administration is moving forward on its plan to build a wall along the 2,000-mile border between Mexico and the U.S.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is currently testing eight border wall prototypes, which are all between 18 and 30 feet high and 30 feet long.\n\nThe agency is evaluating components of each prototype to identify key attributes for potential wall designs, border patrol spokesman Ralph DeSio said in an email. It’s assessing their durability and determining the likelihood they could be scaled or breached using techniques typically used by smugglers.\n\nThe Border Patrol will not use vehicles, drones, catapults or explosives to test the prototypes, DeSio said.\n\nBut the process for building the new wall has raised eyebrows. The Trump Administration has waived more than 60 laws and regulations to speed construction along the border in San Diego and the rebuilding of a fence along two miles of border in Calexico. Those laws included the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nThe Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the federal government in September, arguing it must follow the environmental laws and regulations. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a similar suit over the waivers.\n\nMORE: Behind efforts to build prototypes of Trump's border wall, emails show a confusing and haphazard process\n\nChiu started working on the Mural of Brotherhood after the 2016 election, but he has avoided painting Trump or Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto.\n\n\"I want to send a message that's going to stay longer than Trump or Peña Nieto,\" he said. \"If I want to support people, it's with faith and hope.\"\n\nArtist Luis Vargas traveled from Tijuana to Tecate to help Chiu paint the Mexico-facing side of the border wall. He grew up in Los Angeles and had a green card, but was deported in 2013 after he was charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nVargas said helping Chiu paint the mural in Tecate felt like a peaceful form of expression.\n\n\"It makes me feel good to be a part of something greater than myself,\" he said.\n\nAs about 60 Tecate-area students decorated the wall, they shared their stories of separation. Much of the paint was donated; the Tecate mayor contributed 10 buckets to the effort.\n\nEleven-year-old Edward Santana said his family lived in Riverside County until his Mexican-born father was deported. Edward now lives with his parents and baby sister in Tecate, while his older brother remains in California to attend school.\n\n\"I feel really sad because we want to be over there,\" he said.\n\nMORE: As American kids pour across the border, Mexican schools struggle to keep up\n\nAnother student, 15-year-old Pouletthe Zuñiga, recalled the time she couldn't visit her great-grandmother in the hospital in California.\n\n\"I was one of her favorite granddaughters, but I couldn't see her one last time and couldn't go to her funeral,\" she said. \"It's really sad.\"\n\nChiu empathizes with the students. He said his own mom stayed in the U.S. for 20 years. She didn't return to Mexico until she got her green card last year.\n\nChiu, meanwhile, hasn't crossed the border since the election. He vows he won’t go until he finishes his mural project or Trump is out of office.\n\n\"I have those feelings, I have that connection, too,\" Chiu said, but, \"I don’t like to say those sad words.\"\n\nHe prefers to paint.\n\nRebecca Plevin covers immigration and equality for The Desert Sun.

The state is now Mexico's second most violent, with a homicide rate for the first six months of the year equivalent to 71 murders per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nBy comparison, Honduras and El Salvador — some of the deadliest countries in the world — have homicide rates of around 60 per 100,000.\n\nMexico's most dangerous state is Colima, on the Pacific coast, which saw a 27 percent rise in killings and now has a homicide rate of about 80 per 100,000. The Jalisco cartel is also active there.\n\nThe central state of Guanajuato, home to the colonial city of San Miguel Allende, saw a 122 percent increase in homicides, which were running at a rate of about 40 per 100,000. Authorities say much of the killing is related to gangs of fuel thieves who drill taps into government pipelines.\n\nBut in Baja California Sur, home to the resorts like La Paz and Los Cabos, a stepped-up police presence apparently helped reduce killings. The 125 homicides in the state were less than half the number registered in the first six months of 2017 and a quarter the number in the last half of 2017. Extra police and troops were sent in after warring drug gangs increased killings in the state in 2017.\n\nHope noted that in about half of Mexico's 32 states and the capital, murder rates didn't rise much or at all. \"Now the growth is becoming concentrated\" in some areas.\n\nIt is hard to tell why growth in homicide rates seem to have tapered off in historically violent states like Guerrero, which is home to more than a dozen gangs and is a main growing area for opium poppies.\n\n\"The growth in the use of fentanyl could be reducing the harvest of opium poppies, and that could be having an effect\" on murder rates, Hope said.\n\nFarmers in Guerrero say prices for opium paste have dropped to unprofitable levels because drug cartels are substituting it for cheaper, easier to obtain synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\n\nStill, not all of Mexico's resort areas fared as well as Baja California Sur.\n\nThe Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo, home to resorts like Cancun, Tulum and Cozumel, saw homicides rise by 132 percent, to the equivalent of about 35 killings per 100,000.\n\nThe state accounts for almost half of Mexico's national tourism income. And Mexico has seen international resorts like Acapulco and Zihuatanejo dragged down by a reputation for violence in the past.\n\n\"The can stop it (violence in Quintana Roo), but they have to take care of it very quickly,\" Hope said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/31/plane-crashes-roosevelt-boulevard-philadelphia-northeast-roosevelt-mall-pa/78101561007/", "title": "Plane crashes in Northeast Philadelphia; 6 feared dead", "text": "(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nPHILADELPHIA — A medical transport flight carrying six people, including a young patient being transported home to Mexico, crashed in Northeast Philadelphia on Friday night in a fiery explosion that also left homes and cars burning when the jet fell out of the sky.\n\nThe medical flight would have no survivors, according to the Aviation Safety Network, but Philadelphia authorities said they could not confirm fatalities immediately Friday night as crews of first responders and investigators worked well into the evening at the large crash site and debris field near the Roosevelt Mall at Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard.\n\n\"There were four crew members and two passengers (pediatric patient and escort) on board. No further information is available at this time,\" medical transport company and plane owner Jet Rescue said in a statement. \"At this time, we cannot confirm any survivors. No names are being released at this time until family members have been notified.\"\n\nThe child patient had been treated at Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was given a sendoff earlier Friday for her return trip to Mexico, the hospital said.\n\n\"Our immediate concern is for the patient's family, our personnel, their families and other victims that may have been hurt on the ground.\"\n\nThere are also reports of injuries to those who were on the ground, and Philadelphia hospital staff said they treated a handful of people from the crash that sent crews to an area near the Roosevelt Mall shortly after 6 p.m. when reports of an earth-shaking explosion began to come in to 911.\n\nThe jet crashed to the ground by the shopping center and the neighborhood of rowhomes behind it, which are less than 3 miles from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, a small regional airport, where the medical flight took off.\n\nLocal, state and federal agents responded to the Northeast Philadelphia scene and worked through the night Friday. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker was joined by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro shortly before 10 p.m.\n\n“What you’re seeing here is a unified response to an awful aviation disaster,” Shapiro said.\n\n“For as awful an aviation disaster it was, tonight we also saw the best of Philly. We saw neighbor helping neighbor; we saw Pennsylvanians looking out for each other.”\n\nParker said she couldn't confirm the number of fatalities, despite the statement from the jet company that there were no confirmed survivors on the plane. Witnesses reported body parts strewn around a chaotic scene after the crash.\n\n\"We know there will be loss in this region,\" Shapiro said.\n\nA Temple University Health spokeswoman on Friday night confirmed that the hospital system's Jeanes Campus, which is near the crash site, saw six patients who were injured in the plane crash. Three were treated and released, and three others were listed in fair condition.\n\nThe spokeswoman did not provide information about the types of injuries treated.\n\nBack near the mall, pieces of the Learjet 55 Rescue Air ambulance were seen in the parking lot and surrounding streets. Homes and cars were ablaze. Publicly available flight tracking showed the air ambulance leaving Northeast Philadelphia Airport headed to Missouri at the time of the crash.\n\nPhiladelphia resident Michael Hitchner was sitting in a parked car when the plane went down nearby.\n\nHe said he used his shirt to try to stop the bleeding from a cut on the head of a child who was injured by a piece of debris that fell through a car's windshield.\n\n\"The parents were shouting, 'Help us, help us, help us!'\" Hitchner said.\n\nHe added that he and his wife saw other carnage as well.\n\n\"My wife saw a disembodied foot. I saw a disembodied arm. I saw medical supplies scattered everywhere,\" Hitchner said.\n\n\"It was a very shocking and disturbing experience, seeing everything that happened. I got home. I threw up twice.\"\n\nFAA, NTSB to investigate the small plane crash in Philly\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reported that the medical flight was \"en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri,\" and officials would later say the ultimate destination was Mexico. The agency's statement added that the FAA will investigate, along with the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nPlane crash in Northeast Philadelphia: Fireball lights up sky\n\nThe Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management first reported a “major incident” on its X account, formerly Twitter, just before 7 p.m. Friday.\n\nVideo on X showed the impact of the plane exploding in a fiery crash in what looked like a parking lot of the Roosevelt Mall. Debris can be seen flying from the fire. A car dash cam video from Roosevelt Boulevard shows the explosion lighting up the night sky as drivers, dismayed at the fireball ahead of them, got out of their cars.\n\n“Major incident near Cottman and Bustleton Avenues in Northeast Philadelphia across from Roosevelt Mall off Cottman Avenue. Roads closed in area including parts of Roosevelt Boulevard. Avoid area,” the OEM first reported.\n\nOne video shared on Philadelphia TV news appeared to show the plane rapidly descending at a steep angle toward the ground shortly before a bright fireball emerged.\n\nA police officer who was in the area said he saw a fireball explosion.\n\nSmoke quickly filled the air on the rainy night and was blowing across Roosevelt Boulevard hours after the crash as numerous agencies responded to the scene. People were being kept away, but milled around trying to figure out what happened while police secured a wide perimeter around Roosevelt Mall.\n\nPolice were posted on nearly every corner stopping pedestrians and cyclists from going anywhere close to the crash site. The mayor asked residents not to pick up any debris and said the city opened a shelter for impacted residents.\n\nTimothy Stauffer was at home along Cottman Avenue when he heard the massive boom Friday evening.\n\n“It sounded like they dropped a bomb,” Stauffer said.\n\nHe quickly drove around the corner to find a huge cloud of fire and smoke rising above the busy stretch of Roosevelt Boulevard, a wide and fast highway that runs through the city.\n\n“All this was cloudy, smoky, couldn’t see and then all the EMS and authorities came and started locking things down,” Stauffer said pointing toward the crash site from the police perimeter off Cottman Avenue.\n\nWho was on Jet Rescue flight that crashed in Philadelphia?\n\nJet Rescue spokesman Shai Gold confirmed late Friday that all six people aboard the jet were Mexican nationals including a child patient, the child’s mother, a flight doctor and paramedic, pilot and co-pilot.\n\nThe company was contracted to transport the child from Philadelphia to Tijuana, Mexico, Gold said, but he could not provide any personal information about the child including an age or how long she was in Philadelphia receiving treatment.\n\nGold confirmed that a third-party charitable organization paid for the flight, but he didn’t provide the name of the organization. “Our heart goes out to the families,” Gold said. “It’s really an irreplaceable loss.”\n\nShriners Children’s said the child was given a special sendoff celebration hours before the crash.\n\n\"Shriners Children is heartbroken to confirm that one of our pediatric patients and the child’s mother were aboard the Jet Rescue Air Ambulance that crashed in Philadelphia this evening. The patient had received care from Shriners Children’s Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened. Because of patient privacy concerns, we cannot say any more about the patient and her family at this time,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of the medical crew and pilots who were also lost in this tragic event — as well as all of the people who were affected on the ground – and we’re thankful to the first responders for their quick action.\"\n\nPhiladelphia plane crash: Just stay in your homes, mayor says\n\nParker asked for prayers for anyone who may have been affected by the crash as Philadelphia was put under a citywide emergency response declaration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had been briefed on the Philadelphia crash, and Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, said he had been in touch with Shapiro.\n\nTrump on his Truth Social weighed in on the crash: \"So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost. Our people are totally engaged.\"\n\n\"First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job. More to follow. God Bless you all.\"\n\nCrews continue to work into the night on Northeast Philadelphia plane crash\n\nThe fire at Calvert and Saint Vincent streets near the crash was reportedly under control as of about 8:15 p.m., according to the Philadelphia Fire Department's X account. Several homes were reported to be ablaze in the neighborhood.\n\nLatrice Jackson and her adult daughter Channing Jackson, both residents of Northeast Philadelphia, said they were driving on Roosevelt Boulevard when the plane went down.\n\n\"I had never seen so many police cars in my life,\" Latrice Jackson said.\n\nThe two said they live only a mile from the crash scene.\n\n\"It's scary. This is a neighborhood with a lot of residents and it's too close to home after the other crash,\" Channing Jackson said, referring to a separate recent aviation incident in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"It worries me,\" she added, her eyes drawn to the sky.\n\nThe midair collision of a military helicopter and a commercial plane was on many minds as they surveyed the crash site in Philadelphia as the accidents occurred just days apart. The D.C. crash left 67 dead, and nerves throughout the nation rattled.\n\n“It feels like some weird stuff is happening,” said Noel Vargas, Stauffer’s neighbor on Cottman Avenue. “This is not normal every other day,” Vargas said, referring to the deadly midair collision outside of Washington on Wednesday night.\n\nWhat is Jet Rescue Air Ambulance?\n\nThe plane in the crash was Learjet 55 owned by Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, an air ambulance service based in Miami that provides critical care during transport for all patient conditions to the U.S., Canada and other countries.\n\nThe air ambulance arrived in Philadelphia at Northeast Airport from Miami earlier in the day Friday. It was headed for Springfield, Missouri, and then expected to arrive at the General Abelardo L Rodriguez International Airport in Baja, California, at 9:12 p.m. local time.\n\nAccording to Flight-Aware, the Learjet had been extensively flown this week.\n\nThe jet made three trips Monday in Mexico and Arizona; three trips Tuesday starting in Santa Ana, California, then Phoenix and then Mexico; Wednesday it made two flights in Mexico and New Mexico. Thursday the plane took off in Albuquerque, New Mexico, arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, then traveled to Porta-au-Prince, Haiti, then returned to Miami.\n\nOn its Twitter account, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance reported in 2019 it had a small fire in the landing gear of its LearJet 35A XA-DOC as a result of its brake system while landing at the Toluca Airport on an organ retrieval mission. \"Pilot landed successfully with minor damage. Crew and retrieval team are safe. No one was injured.\"\n\nThe company previously experienced a fatal crash in 2023 in Mexico when five crew members, but no patients, were lost, said Gold, the company spokesman.\n\nThe LearJet 55 is one of the largest aircraft available, and Jet Rescue is among the few air ambulance companies that use them because they are expensive, but an “exceptionally reliable jet.” Jet Rescue flies 600-700 flights a year around the world, Gold said, and the number of trips the LearJet 55 took the five days before the crash is not unusual.\n\nHe noted that the company training for its crew exceeds the industry standard. He added that the airplanes in its fleet are “well-maintained” and that safety is taken seriously, calling each flight a “holy mission.”\n\n“Every flight is like it’s the first flight we ever did,” Gold said. “If a red light goes on in the cockpit, the plane is grounded no matter where it is.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/fact-check/2018/12/05/fact-check-migrant-caravan-criminal-claim-size-and-asylum-process/2129896002/", "title": "Migrant caravan: Fact check on criminal claim, size and asylum ...", "text": "The migrant caravan has traveled more than 2,500 miles to the U.S. border after originating in Central America.

That is gathered through direct engagement, as well as information sharing with our government of Mexico partners.\"\n\nThere have been recent arrests made near the border involving people with criminal records.\n\nA news release by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on Nov. 30 said agents from the Ajo station in southern Arizona apprehended an undocumented person after he entered the United States.\n\nAgents said the man traveled from Honduras and had MS-13 gang tattoos, as well as a felony conviction for weapons misconduct in Maricopa County. According to the Border Patrol, the man said that for his own safety he traveled with the migrant caravan through dangerous parts of Mexico.\n\nFACT CHECK: How many MS-13 gang members are in the United States?\n\nA separate news release by Border Patrol the same day also said agents had arrested a man attempting to cross the border illegally on Nov. 24 near the San Ysidro port of entry, between Tijuana and San Diego.\n\nHe had a murder conviction in Honduras and was released four months ago, according to the agency. The man said he traveled with the migrant caravan from Honduras to the U.S. border.\n\nApart from these two news releases, neither Border Patrol nor the administration has given further information about the 500 persons claimed to have criminal records within the caravan. Officials have not released information about who are considered criminals, what types of crimes were committed and whether the crimes happened in the United States or other countries.\n\nA handful of arrests by Border Patrol does not fully support the claim that a few hundred, or \"a lot,\" of people with criminal records traveled with the caravan.\n\n2. How many people?\n\nAre there are 5,000 migrants in Tijuana, next to the U.S.- Mexico border?\n\nWHO SAID IT: PBS NewsHour online.\n\nMEDIA: Web.\n\nTHE COMMENT: \"Since the first members of the caravan arrived a couple weeks ago, the group amassed in the border city has grown to about 5,000 people.\"\n\nFORUM: Article published Nov. 26.\n\nOUR FINDINGS: Four stars, TRUE\n\nMultiple news reports in the past few weeks, including PBS News Hour online, said that about 5,000 migrants have arrived near San Ysidro port of entry on the border between San Diego and Tijuana. The migrants are waiting to declare asylum with U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nThe mayor of Tijuana, Juan Manuel Gastelum, confirmed in a press conference on Nov. 23 that around 5,000 migrants had arrived in the city. He said he expected the number to swell and due to the lack of public resources and he declared a humanitarian crisis.\n\nRELATED: To stay or to go back? Uncertainty grips migrants waiting in Tijuana\n\nGastelum said the city cannot support the thousands of migrants on its own and has requested humanitarian aid from the Mexican government and the United Nations.\n\nMost migrants are camped out at a sports complex in the city, according to the Associated Press. The conditions are overcrowded and city officials fear that they will worsen as more people arrive.\n\nFederal government estimates show that up to 10,000 migrants could travel to the city. A bottleneck could form in Tijuana as Border Patrol must sort through each asylum case. U.S. officials process about 100 claims a day, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe number of migrants is highly variable. Following the PBS Newshour report, the number peaked at about 6,500 migrants but has since dwindled to around 3,000.\n\nIn an interview with Radio Formula on Dec. 5, David Leon, the national director for Mexico's civil protection agency, said that 2,500 people were in the new shelter on Tijuana's east side and around 500 people had stayed in the area surrounding the now-closed sports complex.\n\nLeon said further that 1,000 people had turned back to their home countries and another 1,000 people tried to cross the U.S. border illegally and were apprehended.\n\nOver the next months, the number of migrants in the city is expected to diminish.\n\n3. How they present to officials\n\nDo migrants have to enter legally at a port of entry if they want to request asylum?\n\nWHO SAID IT: President Donald Trump.\n\nMEDIA: Web.\n\nFORUM: Twitter post on Nov. 24.\n\nTHE COMMENT: \"Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally.\"\n\nOUR FINDINGS: No stars, FALSE\n\nOn Nov. 9, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that declared any person who enters the U.S. illegally will not be allowed to apply for asylum. He sought to overturn current asylum laws, which do not require foreigners to go through a legal port of entry.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the United States, \"whether or not at a designated port of entry,\" can apply for asylum. The act further says the person cannot be deported immediately given they are physically on American soil.\n\nThe bill was introduced in Congress in January 1965. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill into law on Oct. 3 of that year in a symbolic event at the foot of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAdvocacy groups brought a lawsuit against Trump's proclamation almost immediately. On Nov. 20, Judge Jon Tigar of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled against Trump's proclamation in the case, stating that the president cannot unilaterally change asylum laws. The ruling led to criticism from Trump, who called Tigar an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nTrump continued to assert the intended effect of the proclamation in Nov. 24 post on Twitter. \"Migrants will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our country legally...\" he wrote.\n\nBut Tigar issued a 30-day restraining order as part of his ruling, which requires the administration to follow existing asylum laws. The administration cannot legally require migrants to stay in Mexico, although Trump has said Mexico and the U.S. are working on a deal.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the Justice Department filed an appeal in the case to Tigar. The appeal claimed the court's restraining order undermined the president's decision, which was \"necessary to address the ongoing and increasing crisis\" in the immigration system. Tigar refused the appeal on Nov. 30.\n\nMigrants who are apprehended or line up at the ports of entry often claim \"credible fear\" asylum. The 1980 Refugee Act allows for people to claim credible fear of returning to their home because of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political party.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security data shows 91,786 people claimed credible fear cases in fiscal year 2016. Only 20 percent of those applicants ultimately were granted asylum, which is about 18,350 total asylum claims.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the 5,000 migrants at the San Ysidro entry point will be granted asylum even if they file a credible fear claim. The wait likely will take months as they are processed.\n\nSome may find the wait too long and will take other measures to get on U.S. soil. The clash between U.S. Border Patrol and migrants on Nov. 25 occurred after a number of migrants rushed toward the border. Border patrol agents used tear gas after people threw stones and tried to get in through gaps in the fence.\n\nThe tension at the border likely will continue as Tigar's restraining order prevents the administration taking action on the asylum laws for 30 days. The next hearing is set for Dec. 19.\n\nWhile a future ruling could change the AZ Fact Check finding, courts have found current immigration law does not require migrants to legally enter through a port of entry to claim asylum.\n\nSOURCES: Twitter post by President Donald Trump, Nov. 21; Twitter post by President Donald Trump, Nov. 24; \"What's happening with asylum seekers at the border\", PBS NewsHour online, Nov. 26; Customs and Border Protection Nov. 30 media release \"Border Patrol Agents Arrest Caravan Member with MS-13 Ties\"; Customs and Border Protection Nov. 30 media release \"Agents Arrest Murderer Crossing Illegally with Others from Caravan\"; \"Trump claims there are stone cold criminals: Here's what we know\" Nov. 26, USA Today;\"Mexico accepts housing migrants, seeks US development aid\", Nov. 27, Associated Press; \"Tijuana, Mexico declares migrant 'humanitarian crisis', Nov. 24, NBC News; Judge blocks Trump's asylum rules,\" Nov. 20, USA Today; \"Fifty Years On, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act Continues to Reshape the United States,\" Migration Policy Institution; \"Has there been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years?\" June 21, Politifact; \"Central America's Violent Northern Triangle\" backgrounder, The Council on Foreign Relations; \"The Migrant Caravan: what is it and why does it matter?\" BBC News, Nov. 26.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/04/06/bobby-lee-tijuana-story-response/11612540002/", "title": "Bobby Lee responds to backlash over resurfaced Tijuana ...", "text": "Bobby Lee has responded to backlash over resurfaced videos of the comedian repeatedly telling a story, most recently on a 2020 podcast episode, about an encounter with a prostitute in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nThe story details Lee — who is currently on a Bad Friends tour with Andrew Santino — going to Tijuana and scouting for a prostitute in \"hooker alley,\" where he found a \"girl that seemed scared\" and picked her to have sex with. He goes on to describe the woman as \"crying\" before he speeds up the process to \"get it over with.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old has been accused on social media of confessing to a child rape after his past comments began re-circulating in early April. On April 5, Lee addressed the criticism on his \"TigerBelly\" podcast, noting he has been encouraged to not speak up about the story in order to not bring attention to it – but claiming the story was made up.\n\n\"These last couple of weeks have been so bad, I just need to say something. … It's easily explainable,\" the comedian began.\n\nNeed a break?

When Lee saw \"Opie and Anthony\" on his schedule, he recalled telling his team, \"I don't want to do that show. It's just not my brand. It's edgy, shock jock radio.\"\n\nThe following year, he was scheduled to go on the same radio show and Lee said he decided to do \"self-deprecation\" and \"crazy\" jokes to avoid being skewered by the hosts.\n\nAdam Sandler's Mark Twain Prize ceremony: Chris Rock jokes Paul Pelosi 'knows how I felt' after Oscars slap\n\nThe \"Reservation Dogs\" actor said he combined two unsuccessful jokes from his tour to form the Tijuana story. The first bit was about going on a date with a young girl who looked like 12-year-old Natalie Portman from \"Léon: The Professional\" and the second joke was about speeding up the process of sex with his girlfriend who started crying about her recently deceased grandma during the act.\n\n\"I was encouraged to say crazy stuff without thinking about it,\" Lee said of why he told the story. \"When I listen back to it now it puts a chill down my spine.\"\n\nThe comedian continued, \"I changed with society and I look at that story and feel guilt over it.

I'm upset about it and I punish myself over it every second of every day,\" Lee said in his latest podcast episode. \"At the end of the day, it's not real and I didn't do anything.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Lee's reps for comment.\n\nLee is a stand-up comedian, known for being a cast member on MADtv from 2001 to 2009. He has also appeared on shows including \"Splitting Up Together\" and \"Magnum P.I.\" as well as movies \"Pineapple Express\" and \"The Dictator.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}]}
