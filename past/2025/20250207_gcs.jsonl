It takes time to comb through public records. Analyzing data is typically not quick. Determining what questions to ask, and how to ask them, can be a tedious process.\n\nBut for us, the investment of time and energy is worth it. And the work featured in the sixth edition of the Detroit Free Press Community Impact Report affirms that fact.\n\nReporter John Wisely spent years investigating an unsolved murder in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The resulting serial podcast, \"Where Secrets Go to Die,\" uncovered a pattern of police misconduct. This project was a robust team effort, engaging readers in a different way, and prompting a critical look at injustice in a rural area with little oversight.\n\nFood writer Susan Selasky knew something wasn’t right when she started to review the money awarded by the U.S. Small Business Administration's Restaurant Relief Fund. She teamed up with investigative reporter Jennifer Dixon — now retired — and the pair identified $7 million in questionable grants given to restaurants in Michigan. Prompted by the reporting team’s scrutiny, one restaurateur even started giving money back to the SBA before the investigation was published.\n\nThe Free Press staff is committed to journalism that holds systems, institutions and individuals accountable. This year’s impact report highlights work that has moved the needle, prompted important conversations and helped fix societal problems. As a staff, we are dedicated to this work, and we’re grateful that for nearly 200 years readers have shared their time with us.\n\nYour readership is truly appreciated.

At least one state lawmaker noted the issues uncovered by the podcast in his calls for reforms to the Michigan State Police. In a letter to the Free Press, state Sen. Jim Runestad, R-White Lake, said he plans to introduce legislation that would address the issues.\n\nInvestigation finds dubious government grants, resulting in recipient returning funds\n\nA Free Press investigation found the U.S. Small Business Administrations Restaurant Relief Fund awarded more than $7 million in dubious grants to Michigan restaurants.\n\nThe fund was earmarked to provide grants to restaurants that suffered losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. A grant of more than $800,000 was awarded to a metro Detroit restaurant owner. The Free Press investigated the award and the owner, finding that the restaurant closed and was sold prior to the pandemic.\n\nAfter the Free Press’ questions and investigation, the restaurateur returned nearly two-thirds of the grant to the SBA.\n\nCounty says it has taken action to improve conditions in juvenile jail\n\nThe Free Press' three years of reporting on dangerous conditions at Wayne County's juvenile jail continues to spur change. In a March 2024 speech to residents, Wayne County Executive Warren Evans — who runs the juvenile jail — said the county has made significant improvements at the facility, including adding more in-house mental health treatment, hiring about 100 new staffers and boosting pay by 35%, funded by a $10 million budget increase. Since the summer of 2022, the Free Press has reported on the overcrowding and understaffing at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, problems that led to what critics have called inhumane conditions. The newspaper continues to report on conditions at the jail, including interviewing a former employee who is worried someone could be seriously injured or killed.\n\nFree Press obtains, publishes disclosures that prompt sweeping review from ethics watchdog\n\nThe administration of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan requires appointees to file annual conflict of interest disclosures. However, the city does not publicly post them anywhere, and when a Free Press reporter tried to obtain them, the city wanted to charge hundreds of dollars.\n\nAfter a battle, the city eventually acquiesced, releasing hundreds of records. Despite releasing the information in a wonky format, the Free Press worked to publish the disclosures in a format easily accessible to Detroiters. The Free Press also used the data to show that at least four out of 10 of the highest-ranking city officials don't actually live in Detroit — including the city's then-deputy mayor, who has since been appointed interim police chief. Subsequently, the Detroit Board of Ethics realized many of the appointees who filed a disclosure with Duggan's administration also needed to file disclosures with that board. The leader of the organization sent out a slew of letters to mayoral appointees in the fall of 2024. Although the Duggan administration initially fought making the information available to the ethics board, it eventually gave in, culminating in the release of 89 additional disclosures. Overall, Free Press reporting led to the most disclosures ever received by the board in a year.\n\nInvestigation into unconstitutional acts by judges raises awareness ahead of possible high court decision\n\nIn 2019, the Michigan Supreme Court determined that trial court judges cannot sentence someone as though they committed a crime for which they were found not guilty. While this act is now considered unconstitutional, the Free Press found an unknown number of people remain in Michigan prisons for exactly this reason — sentenced to years in prison despite a not guilty verdict.\n\nWe highlighted the case of two men: one who shot and killed two people, the second who watched him. The shooter was convicted of two murders and sentenced to life without parole. But he has since been released from prison, since he was under 18 at the time of the shooting. The other man was found not guilty of murdering either person. But the judge determined he played a role in at least one of their deaths, and sentenced him to at least 50 years in prison. Now, despite not pulling the trigger — and spending the last 33 years in prison on a sentence deemed unconstitutional — he must wait longer in prison.\n\nLawyers for this man and others who face similar circumstances asked the Michigan Supreme Court to weigh in and make their 2019 ruling retroactive, so it would apply to any case in the past. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, but the state's highest court could take up the issue at any time.\n\nThe Free Press investigation brought substantial attention to an issue that is not well understood but impacts an unknown number of Michiganders.\n\nDetroit judges may no longer use online chat feature after Freep investigation\n\nThe Free Press immediately jumped on the case of 36th District Court Judge Kenneth King after he had a teen girl detained and threatened with jail for falling asleep in his courtroom. But the Free Press went beyond the initial headlines to uncover arguably more disturbing behavior: King routinely used an online chat associated with livestreaming his proceedings on YouTube to engage with viewers of his court. And while many of those interactions could be considered harmless, others clearly dealt with the substance of proceedings — and happened while King was on the bench.\n\nHis superiors, state officials and other lawyers criticized his actions, but the Free Press showed they had known about his conduct for years. After Free Press reporting, 36th District Chief Judge William McConico said no judge in his court could use the YouTube chat function any longer. This change will have a direct impact on justice in Detroit: Multiple defense lawyers have argued King's use of the chat directly correlated with his decisions on cases.\n\nWayne County cancels contract of former CFO after domestic violence charges revealed\n\nFormer Wayne County CFO Tony Saunders had a lucrative consulting contract with the county canceled after the Free Press revealed details of the contract — and an incident that resulted in Saunders being charged with domestic violence in the beating of his wife in their home.\n\nWe also reported on a second incident that resulted in Saunders being charged with domestic violence.\n\nAfter 18 years, Detroit police reopen investigation into woman killed during 2006 Super Bowl\n\nWith the NFL returning to Detroit for a major event with the 2024 draft, the Free Press looked back at an unsolved murder committed the last time the NFL staged a major event in Detroit — the 2006 Super Bowl.\n\nAs a result of our queries, Detroit police said they would use new technology and resources to see whether evidence they collected 18 years ago would generate new leads that could help them catch the killer.\n\nFree Press uncovers secret agreements between prosecutor and Oxford High officials after school shooting\n\nAfter the historic convictions of James and Jennifer Crumbley, the first parents in America to be held responsible for a mass school shooting, the families of the victims shifted their focus to Oxford High School, where their son killed four students and injured seven people, including a teacher. They argued that school officials also made mistakes that day, and wanted them held accountable. But the prosecutor dealt families' hopes a blow when she announced no school officials would be charged. A Free Press investigation discovered two key school officials who had drawn scrutiny over their decisions involving the shooter had signed confidential agreements with the prosecutor's office that protected them from liability. They had signed these \"proffer agreements\" early on — as the prosecutor built her case against the Crumbleys — and would go on to testify against them. The Free Press investigation prompted the prosecutor's office to release the agreements, which are now the focal point of Jennifer Crumbley's appeal. Her lawyer argues the confidential agreements that we discovered amount to suppressed evidence and Brady violations, and says they are grounds for tossing Jennifer Crumbley's conviction.\n\nJuror explains key factors in groundbreaking conviction\n\nAfter the conviction of the father of the Oxford High School shooter, the Free Press was the only news media outlet to get an interview with a juror, and explain to the public what drove the jury to reach a guilty verdict in this unprecedented and high profile case.\n\nWe found the jury foreman in his home on a country road, and he explained that the storage of the gun was a key issue, along with the shooter's claims that his dad ignored his pleas for mental health treatment.\n\nWe provided readers nationwide with an exclusive, inside view into the deliberation room of this historic case, and explained what issues mattered most to the jury.\n\nMichigan's fatally flawed system for tracking lobbyists' freebies to lawmakers\n\nEye On Michigan, a student investigative reporting program that partners with the Free Press, revealed that the state's system for tracking freebies is broken.\n\nNevertheless, student reporters, working with Free Press data analysts, found that lobbyists lavished more than $6 million in free meals and trips on Michigan lawmakers between 2001-2023, even though flaws in the system make it impossible to determine how much state officials really got.\n\nEye on Michigan and the Freep also created a searchable database revealing how much lobbyists reported giving to every lawmaker who served between 2001 and 2023.\n\nCandidate for U.S. Senate loses close race after investigation reveals he registered to vote at a home where he does not live\n\nRepublican Mike Rogers and Democrat Elissa Slotkin were engaged in one of the most competitive U.S. Senate races in the nation when the Free Press revealed that Rogers was registered to vote at a home that was under construction, did not have a certificate of occupancy, and was not where he actually lived.\n\nOur investigation raised other questions about whether Rogers, who also owned a mansion in Florida, was truly living where he said he was after moving to Michigan a year before the election. Our investigation prompted other news organizations, from MSNBC to our competitor The Detroit News, to run their own versions of our story after we first published it.\n\nWhile Republican Donald Trump won Michigan by nearly 1.5% — with a margin of 49.73% to Kamala Harris' 48.31% — Republican Rogers lost by less than 1.3% — receiving 48.30% to Slotkin's 48.64% in one of the closest U.S. Senate races in the country.\n\nBiden drops out of race on day Free Press poll shows him lagging badly in Michigan\n\nOn July 21, we released a poll done for the Detroit Free Press and its media partners that revealed a shocking response: President Joe Biden, then the Democratic nominee, trailed Republican candidate President Donald Trump by 7 points in Michigan.\n\nIt was a historically bad showing for a Democratic nominee — especially in a state Biden won four years before by 3 points, and that had gone for a GOP nominee (by a much smaller margin) once in 36 years.\n\nThe poll was cited by other outlets — notably Politico, who deemed it the \"Dem freakout of the day,\" noting, \"Democrats have been sending this poll to us all morning. \"Brutal,\" said one former senior Biden official. President Biden dropped out of the presidential race later that same day.\n\nGM suspends arrest powers for contracted private security force at Renaissance Center\n\nA day after our monthslong investigation into allegations of racism and abuse by white private security officers against Black visitors at General Motors' Renaissance Center office complex published in November 2023, GM kicked officers named in federal lawsuits off its properties in Detroit. In January, GM went a step further: The company suspended the private security force’s arrest powers, removed handcuffs from officer uniforms and reduced the number of armed officers in the complex.\n\nWayne County judge candidate defeated after history of violence against women revealed\n\nVoters didn't know much about Wayne County Probate Court judge candidate Daniel Mercier until the Free Press began digging into his background, which revealed that multiple women had accused him of attacking them as well as a history of lying and bad debt.\n\nOur investigation found that two women in Michigan obtained personal protection orders against Mercier and that he was convicted in Florida of domestic violence. Mercier finished last in the four-person race.\n\nSenator introduced legislation to prevent Michigan from taking foster kids' benefits\n\nAfter the Free Press published an article detailing how the state of Michigan takes federal financial benefits from children in foster care to reimburse itself for the cost of their care, state Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, introduced legislation to end the practice. Although Irwin said the issue had previously been brought to his attention by a constituent, he told the Free Press the article was \"helpful in highlighting the concern and propelling the conversation.\" The legislation introduced by Irwin differs from a previously introduced bill referenced in the story by allowing foster children to keep 100% of their benefit money, which is typically awarded to children who have disabilities or are orphans, instead of an age-based percentage.\n\nReaders donate $25,000 to dad taking care of his dying teenage son\n\nAfter the Free Press wrote a story about Trae Hawthorne, a 15-year-old dying of cancer in a small town in rural Michigan, Trae started a fundraiser not for himself, but for his father, whom he calls \"my hero\" for quitting two jobs to stay at home full time with his dying son.\n\nThe teenager did it not only to raise much-needed funds for the family, but also to let the world know about his dad's selflessness. The act received little attention until the Detroit Free Press wrote about it.\n\nReaders responded with hundreds of small donations that added up in a matter of days to $25,000 and counting.\n\n‘Coldwater Kitchen’ documentary goes international\n\nThe documentary film \"Coldwater Kitchen,\" produced by the Detroit Free Press, was selected for the 2025 American Film Showcase, the flagship film and TV exchange program of the U.S. Department of State. \"Coldwater Kitchen\" chronicles the lives of the men enrolled in the unique culinary arts vocational program at Michigan's Coldwater prison, and the life of the man who runs the program, Chef Jimmy Lee Hill.\n\nFunded by a grant from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and produced by USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, American Film Showcase works with more than 60 U.S. embassies or consulates each year to host international film screenings and train global storytellers. Coldwater Kitchen co-director Brian Kaufman traveled to Fiji in November 2024 to lead a multiday video journalism workshop for Fijian journalists.\n\nWorking with nearly a dozen reporters from print, television and radio outlets, Kaufman taught character-driven video storytelling techniques designed for journalists who work alone or in small teams, drawing from his repertoire of video projects over a nearly 20-year career at the Detroit Free Press. In addition to the Fiji program, American Film Showcase organized international screenings of \"Coldwater Kitchen\" in Georgia and India, with more engagements expected in 2025. Locally, the film continues to find a wide audience through community engagement screenings. The Michigan Justice Fund, steadfast supporters of \"Coldwater Kitchen,\" hosted screenings of the film for elected officials and advocates working in support of community members directly affected by incarceration.\n\nThe men featured in the film regularly accompany its screenings for panel discussions and dinner and movie events. Chef Dink Dawson and Executive Producer Desiré Vincent Levy spoke at the 2024 Michigan Works! annual conference about the importance of vocational training for returning citizens. In July, Chef Jimmy Lee Hill, Chef Dink Dawson and Chef Ernest Davis, along with the entire film team, traveled to New York City for screenings at Platform by the James Beard Foundation and the IFC Center.\n\nPublic hearing held, conversation advances around Michigan energy rates\n\nAn exploration of how energy rates are determined in Michigan, with a uniquely personal approach to explaining a complex process, generated broader conversation around DTE Energy's 10 straight years of rate increase requests. A Michigan Radio interview that followed publication furthered the discussion, and the piece brought attention to calls for a Detroit public hearing on the matter — which Michigan Public Service Commission officials initially said was unlikely. The MPSC held the hearing, and heard from dozens of angry Detroiters on persistent rate increases. The commission ultimately approved a gas rate increase that was lower than DTE requested. MPSC is still considering an electric rate increase that would raise average annual household billing by $135.\n\nCash-strapped Highland Park School District abandons plan to spend $1 million on abandoned building\n\nHighland Park is a cash-strapped school district that has only a couple of employees, no students and no schools, yet the district was planning to spend $1 million on an abandoned building it hoped to turn into an administration building and potential education center.\n\nThe building is the same one the district sold about 15 years earlier for less than $100,000 to a developer who was supposed to tear it down. After the Free Press revealed the district's plan, board members rejected the deal.\n\nDetroit officials agree to explore opening riverfront parks on fireworks night\n\nA colorful description of the annual Ford fireworks night in Detroit brought attention to the city's long-standing policy of closing riverfront parks to spectators during the display. Detroiters often settle for a sliver of a view of the fireworks despite what could be spectacular viewing from the city's pristine riverfront parks. The parks are closed in an effort to avoid security issues, with little public discussion on the curious strategy.\n\nAfter the Free Press column published, the city council president and the city's Chief Operating Officer promised to explore reopening the parks during next year's display.\n\nBoy abandoned in Jamaica by adoptive parents returns to Michigan\n\nWhen the Free Press learned that a Michigan boy had been abandoned in Jamaica by his adoptive parents for months, we pushed government agencies to explain why no one was helping return the boy home after his Jamaican boarding school was shut down over abuse claims. The Free Press learned his parents never went back to get him, and that government agencies dragged their feet for months, ignoring the boy's pleas for help and his lawyers' requests for intervention. Our reporting would not only detail this boy's hellish nightmare, but exposed the numerous failures of all levels of government, and the lengths advocates went to get him home.\n\nIn the end, our reporting caught the attention of many in the boy's hometown of Traverse City, and inspired a woman to step up and offer to take him in as a foster child.\n\nAs journalists, we aspire to open the world's eyes to the suffering and mistreatment of vulnerable individuals, with the hopes that we can bring about changes and help people. This enterprise piece did just that.\n\nMichigan family seeks novel prosecution after teen driver killed their son — they want his mom charged, too\n\nAfter a teen driver killed his friend in a high-speed car crash, the victim's family reached out to us about a possible legal issue they wanted to pursue: They wanted the driver's mom charged, too, maintaining she knew her son was a reckless driver through an app she had on his phone, but never took the keys away.\n\nThe Free Press investigated, and produced an enterprise story that showed how technology may now be used to hold parents accountable for their child's actions. In this case, the Free Press obtained records that showed the driver had a history of speeding over 100 mph, and his mom would warn him through texts to slow down.\n\nThe story went national as it touched on themes and problems that resonate with families all over: Problematic teenagers. Family fights. Divorce. It was also a story of unimaginable pain, grief, and loss. When we think of impactful journalism — stories that make people feel, think, or act more carefully — this gut-wrenching piece delivers.\n\nThousands of Detroiters remain on water affordability plan\n\nAfter the Free Press wrote about obstacles that barred Detroiters in poverty from a program that reduces monthly water bills to as low as $18 a month, and wipes away back water debt — participants were required to verify that they were still income-eligible to remain on the plan — at least 3,000 households contacted the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency, which is administering the program, according to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), to get reconnected.\n\nMobile home residents reach out about housing conditions\n\nAfter we wrote about Michigan mobile home residents fighting rent hikes and worsening conditions, we received a flood of emails from residents also dealing with mobile home troubles or who appreciated the coverage. Readers reached out about rising rent, undrinkable water, aged sewer lines and overall neglect.\n\nStudents across the country learned about a coming memorial ceremony for a longtime Detroit educator\n\nAfter a community member reached out about a memorial service for a longtime Detroit educator, Alfredine Wiley, the Free Press published a story that highlighted Wiley's life. For most of her career, Wiley worked as head of the counseling department at Detroit's Cass Technical High School. After the story was published, Wiley's daughters reported that former students from all over the country who had been touched by Alfredine Wiley were sending RSVPs for the Sept. 14 memorial service.\n\nAfter a more than 20-year wait, a Detroiter was finally able to thank her high school counselor\n\nPriscilla Wade, a successful psychologist in Okemos, reached out to the Free Press in hopes of being able to thank the high school counselor who made it possible for her to attend college in the 1970s. The former high school counselor, Dr. Arthur Divers, was the subject of a \"Detroit Is...\" feature published the previous year.\n\nWade's outreach to the Free Press helped her to reach Divers, whom she invited, along with Divers' daughter, to Osborn High School's Class of 1974 50th Reunion. A story about Wade's long quest to thank Divers was the subject of a \"Detroit Is ...\" feature on Sept. 8, 2024. Wade and others on the reunion's organizing committee also used the story to spread the word in the community about the reunion, which was held Sept. 20, 2024.\n\nArticle helps 87-year-old first-time author spread the word about her book\n\nA Feb. 4, 2004 \"Detroit Is ...\" feature about 87-year-old, first-time author Frances Lewis, significantly helped to spread the word about Lewis' life story, which began in Detroit's Black Bottom. Following the publication of the story, the Free Press received several messages from readers who wanted to purchase Lewis' book.\n\nSt. Patrick Senior Center, Lewis' home away from home, also was contacted by many in the community, and as a result, St. Patrick Senior later hosted a book signing for Lewis. Among the interested community members that were anxious to learn more about Lewis was an eighth grade homeroom class at St. Clare of Montefalco Catholic School in Grosse Pointe Park taught by Mary White.\n\nThe Free Press was contacted by White, who was eager to connect her students to Lewis, which included making arrangements for her students to attend the book signing. White said her students were interested in Lewis' life and journalism.\n\nMacomb County Sheriff candidate who got improper tax break loses close election\n\nWe investigated whether Terence Mekoski, the Republican nominee for Macomb County sheriff, committed voter fraud by registering to vote in a town where he did not live, or received a property tax break he did not deserve because he listed a home where he did not live full-time as his principal residence.\n\nOur first step was to determine where Mekoski really lived, since multiple addresses were associated with him.\n\nAfter examining public records and knocking on doors, the Free Press determined that Mekoski was legally registered to vote at his in-laws' home in Shelby Township. We also determined that he was not entitled to a property tax break he had been receiving at a home in Oregon Township.\n\nOur inquiries prompted township officials to investigate, and Mekoski acknowledged that he was not entitled to the property tax break he had been receiving.\n\nOur story raised questions about Mekoski's integrity and attention to detail, and he lost a close race by a margin of 52% to 48% in a county that his fellow Republican Donald Trump won by a margin of 56% to 42%.\n\nMom finds support for grieving children\n\nAfter friends sent links to a Free Press story about a camp for children who lost someone to suicide, a mom signed up two of her kids.\n\nIn March 2024, the Free Press wrote about a grief camp for kids that was coming to Michigan for the first time ever. Friends of a metro Detroit mom sent her links to the story, knowing that her husband and the father of her children had died from suicide. She enrolled her kids in the camp. We got to know her daughter. And while she and her daughter do not wish to participate in a further story about attending the camp, she believes it was beneficial to the grieving process.\n\nFree Press builds civic pride bringing community behind scenes of long-neglected train station's renovation\n\nAs the Michigan Central Station reopening came to fruition, the Free Press followed along and produced coverage that got people excited about the historic train depot that had been closed since 1988 and became a symbol of blight Free Press coverage of the reopening of Michigan Central Station, the historic train depot that had been closed since 1988 and had become a symbol of blight, helped build excitement and pride as it reopened as a community center and mobility innovation incubator.\n\nThe Free Press told how Ford Motor Co., which bought the derelict building in 2018, spared no expense or detail to restore the station, going so far as to reopen a limestone quarry in Indiana to ensure matching materials. We told of a flooded secret basement, a Romanian clockmaker, the significance of graffiti and how the station had become a community third place, mixing neighborhood youths, bona fide artists and homeless people. Companion stories told of the importance of the station to neighborhoods on both sides of the signature building. Finally, we celebrated with the city as a star-studded concert formally opened the station.\n\nWhen the Free Press saved Thanksgiving ... and a marriage?\n\nNearly everyone cooks, but not all know how. Along with a host of other Thanksgiving tips and techniques, we told our readers how to spatchcock a turkey — splitting it along the backbone and cooking it flat — a method that shortens cooking time. The story prompted this email from a happy reader:\n\n\"Happy belated Thanksgiving! Had to send you a note to thank you for writing the article about spatchcocking. I had said to (my wife) the previous week that we were going to spatchcock the turkey this year due to time constraints. She gave me 'the look' and asked me to explain this method, and why. She was very skeptical of me, and this new method. You then penned your article, and she approved of said technique. Our bird turned out great and was a big hit. An 18-pound bird that I brined as well. Thanks for helping to maintain marital bliss.\"\n\nWe're in the dictionary\n\nMerriam-Webster.com cited a sentence that appeared in a Free Press story as an example of the correct use of the word \"opioid.\"\n\nThanks, Mr. President\n\nA \"Detroit Is ...\" story about the life of 104-year-old Detroiter Julia Esaw, which included her excitement for being able to cast a vote for Kamala Harris in the presidential election, was published on Nov. 3, 2024.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama tweeted a link to the story on the social media platform X the next day. Obama used the tweet to help drum up support for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the hours leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Obama's tweet put the story in front of thousands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/archives/2013/05/31/golden-venture-20-years-later-many-lives-remain/74873348/", "title": "Golden Venture 20 years later today: Many lives remain in limbo", "text": "MIKE ARGENTO\n\nYorkDailyRecord\n\nYork, PA -\n\nNot long ago, while in Philadelphia's Chinatown, Sean Chen ran into a man he had known 20 years ago.\n\nThey talked and found that they both came to this country the same way, on the same ship, the doomed Golden Venture. They shared a history, a dismal history. They made the same voyage. They made the same lives here.\n\nChen knew the man, knew his life story, knew him like a brother.\n\nBut for the life of him, he couldn't remember the man's name. No matter how hard he searched his memory, the man's name remained hidden, lurking with memories that Chen wishes did not exist.\n\n\"The past is the past,\" he said recently. \"I try to forget.\"\n\nIt's not easy.\n\n* * *\n\nIt's hard to believe it's been 20 years, Chen said. Twenty years since that early morning off the shore of Rockaway Beach in Queens, N.Y. Twenty years since he came to America and what he thought would be freedom. Twenty years, passed by in the blink of an eye.\n\nThen a teenager, he was among the 286 Chinese men and women who came to America aboard the ship, fleeing the oppression of their homeland. And he was among the 154 men who were detained in the York County Prison -- galvanizing a community that fought for them -- as their cases wound through the justice system, navigating the sometimes Byzantine world of immigration law.\n\nTwenty years, and Chen is still a man without a country. He cannot return to China -- not that he'd want to, he has lived here longer than he lived in China -- and he is not a U.S. citizen. His immigration status, like that of 30 of his fellow refugees who remain in this country, is unsettled. He remains on parole and has not been granted residency.\n\nThe word used to describe his status most often is \"limbo.\" He is here, but again, he is not.\n\n* * *\n\nChen was born Oct. 4, 1974, in Fujian Province in southeastern China, near Taiwan. His father was a teacher who had run afoul of the government's one-child policy -- Chen was one of three children. Chen was strong-willed. He had been suspended from school in the eighth grade for disagreeing with a teacher. At 14, he and a cousin worked to organize pro-democracy students at the local university. He was smart and fearless.\n\nAnd that's how he came to come to America. In 1991, a government official came to his family's home and demanded 6,000 yuan from Chen's father, apparently payment of a fine for violating the country's one-child policy. Chen got into a heated argument with the official.\n\nThe police came after him, and Chen ran and hid. He met somebody who knew people who could get him out of the country, perhaps all the way to America. They were the snakeheads, a crime organization that, in the words of a paralegal who worked with the Golden Venture refugees, \"makes the Mafia look like the Waltons.\"\n\nChen's family raised 4,000 yuan as a down payment, and he left China in the company of the smugglers, crossing the border into Burma, now known as Myanmar. From there, he crossed into Thailand, and wound up in Bangkok, where he was stranded for a month.\n\nWhen he left China, he had a backpack with a few T-shirts. He didn't have ID or a passport or a driver's license.\n\nHe was supposed to fly to America, but crackdowns at the airports made it impossible. So he was given the option of sailing. He and other refugees left Bangkok and boarded the Najd II in the Gulf of Taiwan.\n\nThat was on July 16, 1992.\n\nThe ship was old and in bad shape, and it took more than a month to cross the Indian Ocean. Six weeks after leaving Taiwan, the ship reached Mombassa in Kenya. Stranded there, Chen called home and told his parents, \"Either I die, or I get to the United States.\"\n\nOn April 2, 1993, according to Patrick Radden Keefe's 2009 book \"The Snakeheads: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream,\" he and some of the others stranded in Mombassa boarded fishing boats and were taken to their new vessel -- the Golden Venture. It was smaller than the Najd II, and there were already about 100 passengers aboard the cargo ship.\n\nConditions were \"horrible,\" Chen recalled. There was not enough food. There was not enough water. There was not enough space.\n\nThe ship hit storms crossing the Atlantic and once, almost capsized. \"Everyone was screaming and crying,\" Chen recalled. \"I remember thinking whatever happened would happen, and I closed my eyes. Twenty years, and I try not to think about it.\"\n\nAfter more than two months at sea, the Golden Venture ran aground off the coast of Queens on June 6, 1993. .\n\nIt was early in the morning, still dark out. Chen remembered seeing the lights of the city and feeling more than relief. He felt joy. \"This is the United States of America,\" he thought.\n\nHe jumped into the surf and began swimming to shore. The water was cold and rough. The beach appeared closer than it was. It seemed to take 100 years to swim ashore, he remembered.\n\nTen of those who tried to swim didn't make it.\n\nChen did and passed out from exhaustion on the beach.\n\nHe woke handcuffed to a hospital bed. A police officer was sitting nearby, and Chen asked, \"New York?\"\n\nThe police officer replied, \"Yep, New York.\"\n\nLater that morning, he was in a warehouse with the other Golden Venture passengers. They boarded buses. They weren't told where they were going.\n\nA few hours later, he arrived at the York County Prison.\n\n* * *\n\nNot long after the Golden Venture refugees arrived at the prison, the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- what Immigration and Customs Enforcement was called then -- contacted the York County Bar Association about providing them legal representation.\n\nJeff Lobach, a partner in the Barley Snyder law firm and newly elected president of the bar, scrambled to find attorneys who had experience with immigration work. He found \"we didn't have much in the way of immigration lawyers.\"\n\nImmigration law is a specialty. It's complex, and its procedures follow different rules. The bar had a few crash courses in immigration law for the lawyers who volunteered, and they went to work.\n\n\"We had to learn the basics,\" he recalled, \"how to file for asylum and all of that. We thought it was just another pro bono case. We had no idea.\"\n\nThose early hearings were a farce, lawyers recalled. Some of them were held over the phone with a judge in Baltimore. The translators provided spoke Cantonese or Mandarin, not the Fujian dialect that the detainees spoke. The detainees were asked for documentation that either did not exist or was buried somewhere in the bureaucracy of China.\n\n\"They didn't have a bloody chance in hell,\" Beverly Church said.\n\nChurch was working as a paralegal at the time and had volunteered to work on the cases. Her job was to go to the prison, meet the detainees and start the paperwork that would be filed in immigration court. She knew little of the case.\n\nThe first detainee she met was Zhang Xia Bin. He was rail thin, she recalled, like \"he had really been through it.\" He told her that he left China because he had had a second child. She'll never forget looking into his eyes and seeing the pain and suffering that he had experienced on his voyage, the exhaustion, the longing for someone to help him.\n\nShe left the meeting a different person.\n\nShe looked back at the prison as she left and thought about her grandfather, who had come to America from Ireland. \"What if my grandfather was treated that way?\" she thought. \"What if my grandfather was put in jail when he landed in America?\"\n\nThe legal battles went on for years. Some of them -- 35 by one count -- were granted asylum. A few received artist's visas, a result of the intricate artwork many of the detainees made in prison from scraps of paper. A dozen accepted an offer from several South American countries to relocate there. Ninety-nine gave up and opted to be deported back to China, unable to tolerate incarceration.\n\nThe rest remained.\n\nAnd fought.\n\n* * *\n\nJoan Maruskin read about the detainees in the local press and decided right then that she had to do something. A United Methodist minister with a strong sense of social justice, Maruskin believed the men were victims of a grave injustice. She felt compelled to act.\n\nShe called local lawyer Craig Trebilcock, one of the lead attorneys representing the men, and asked what she could do. Trebilcock told her that the legal effort would not be enough, that the predicament of the detainees had to become a matter of public interest.\n\nMaruskin then called Byron Borger, owner of the Hearts & Minds bookstore in Dallastown and an advocate for social justice, and planned what would be the first prayer vigil at the prison in August 1993.\n\nAbout 10 people attended. They were greeted by members of the press and heavy security. Armed prison guards kept watch over the vigil. \"It was very strange,\" Maruskin said. \"We had guys with rifles pointed at people praying.\"\n\nThat started it. For about a year, every day, people would gather in front of the prison to hold vigil. The vigils continued weekly, for 31/2 years, as long as the detainees remained in the prison. The members of the group, called People of the Golden Vision, were varied. Pro-life advocates, protesting China's brutal enforcement of its one-child policy, which included forced abortion and sterilization, locked arms with members of the ACLU. Those who felt a religious commitment to human rights stood side-by-side with civil-libertarian non-believers.\n\nChen recalled seeing the protesters outside the prison.\n\n\"It made us feel hope that people cared about us,\" he said. \"It made us feel good.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWhile the legal and public-interest efforts continued, it became apparent that politics had played a role in the detention of the refugees.\n\nEarly on, according to advocates for the detainees, the Clinton Administration decided to make an example of the Golden Venture passengers, as a part of its effort to crack down on human trafficking and the criminal enterprises that ran the networks, and ordered the refugees be jailed instead of being allowed to post bond. The detainees of the Golden Venture just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n\"It was a perfect storm,\" said Mary Weaver, then a senior legislative assistant to U.S. Rep. Todd Platts, R-York County.\n\nLegislative efforts to free the men began in the 1990s and continue today. Platts, continuing the work of former U.S. Rep. Bill Goodling, R-York County, kept introducing what's called a private relief bill, a bill that targets one specific group often used to grant residency status or asylum to immigrants. In each session of Congress, it failed. It once got to a committee but never came up for a vote.\n\nThat bill, now being shepherded by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, is pending. It is unlikely to pass, despite efforts by Church and others to lobby Congress. That's typical. Private bills rarely pass. Only one has passed in the last three years. The bill does have one effect: It protects the former detainees from deportation. While an act of Congress is pending, the men cannot be sent back to China.\n\n\"It's just really frustrating,\" said Weaver, now executive director of the Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center in York.\n\nHer old boss echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"They did pay a very significant penalty for coming here illegally,\" Platts said. \"We took away their liberty for more than three years. That they're still in limbo doesn't speak well about the way in which their cases have been handled.\"\n\n* * *\n\nChen was younger than many of the other detainees, and he was able to adjust to prison. He learned English, expanding on his rudimentary skill with the language picked up from a Chinese-English dictionary that he had studied on the voyage to America. He studied to get his GED.\n\nStill, he was in prison. But, he reasoned, what choice did he have? He could return to China, where he could be thrown in prison, or worse.\n\nThe worst part was the boredom. It led to the creation of art. It started when one detainee, using pages torn from a magazine, folded the paper into intricate pieces and assembled them to make a pineapple. Others became involved, and when it was over, they had created 16,000 pieces of art -- everything from lobsters to bald eagles to a model of the Golden Venture fashioned from legal paper, pages from magazines, newsprint, toilet paper or whatever they could get their hands on. .\n\nThe artwork was purchased by galleries and given as gifts. Hundreds of the sculptures found their way into York County homes. \"Life\" magazine did a piece about the artwork. The Museum of Chinese in America in New York created an exhibit of the work. Some even appeared in a Smithsonian exhibition.\n\nChen recalls how awful the food was. The closest thing they could get to Asian cuisine was Cup Noodles, and they were prized in the prison. Chen jokes that he must've eaten 10,000 Cup Noodles in his time in jail. He has vowed to never eat them again.\n\nChen got out of prison more than a year before some of his fellow detainees. His lawyer, Ann Carr, from Lancaster, was successful in using an arcane legal argument to convince a federal judge to release him on bail. She argued that since Chen had reached the shore, he had technically entered the country. And since he had entered the country, the government could only hold him for so long before granting bail. The judge bought it and set Chen's bail at $10,000.\n\nHe raised bail from relatives in China and the United States and left the prison in 1996.\n\nAbout a year later, on Feb. 27, 1997, the remaining 55 detainees in the York County Prison were paroled.\n\n* * *\n\nOne irony: Among those behind the Golden Venture human smuggling operation was a Chinese gang leader named Guo Liang Chi, also known as Ah Kay, kingpin of the Fuk Ching gang, one of the most powerful Asian gangs in New York, according to news reports.\n\nHe was a terror, described in Keefe's book \"The Snakehead\" as a cold-blooded gangster who killed and tortured those who got in his way.\n\nHe was arrested in Hong Kong and extradited to the United States, where he cooperated with investigators in at least 15 cases. His cooperation resulted in the prosecutions of 35 gang members, including Cheng Chui Ping, known as Sister Ping, the main investor behind the Golden Venture. (The Golden Venture was estimated to gross $8.5 million.)\n\nAh Kay reached a plea deal. In return for his cooperation, he was sentenced to 21/2 years in prison.\n\nAbout the same amount of time Sean Chen spent in jail in York County.\n\n* * *\n\nChen moved to Philadelphia and went to work in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nOther detainees settled around the country, going to cities where they had relatives, many of them finding work in Chinese restaurants. A few stayed in York County and have maintained a low profile. Very few of the detainees speak publicly; part of that is cultural -- they don't wish to call attention to themselves -- and part of it is fear as they could still be deported. Chen, now a slight man with a receding hairline, is among those who speaks out, believing that if people hear the story of the Golden Venture, they will rally behind the former detainees. (Chen told his story in depth in Keefe's \"The Snakehead.\")\n\nChen later moved to New York, working as a delivery boy, among other things. He then moved to Hartford, Conn., where he had a cousin and bought a Chinese restaurant. When that didn't work out, he moved back to Philadelphia and went to work at a Japanese steakhouse, tending bar and waiting tables. He moonlighted in Chinese restaurants and tended bar at an Irish pub.\n\nHe still works a couple of jobs -- 50 to 60 hours a week.\n\nHe bought a house in northeast Philadelphia. He married and had two children.\n\nHe feels like an American. His first date with his wife was a Super Bowl party at a friend's house -- the Eagles were playing the New England Patriots. (Chen is an Eagles fan. \"The Eagles upset me,\" he said.)\n\nHe is thinking about moving to Baltimore, where he has another cousin. He hopes to buy a little convenience store, a mom-and-pop operation that he can run with his wife and have his children around -- a way to make a living and spend more time with his family.\n\nHe still faces an uncertain future. His status is in limbo, and theoretically, he could be deported at any time, sent back to China, where he would be a stranger in a strange land. He no longer has family in China; they moved to Taiwan, his father's homeland.\n\nChen has never been back to visit; he can't leave the country. He regrets that he missed his father's funeral in 2006.\n\nYet he has no regrets about coming to America. He came here when he was still a teenager. He is now a 38-year-old husband and father.\n\n\"I belong to this country,\" he said. \"My wife and family, it's all I got. I do whatever I can to make life better for my family.\"\n\nAbout the people, the ship\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nOf the 286 passengers on the Golden Venture:\n\n--- 262 were men, 24 were women.\n\n--- 10 died.\n\n--- Six escaped the night the ship ran aground.\n\n--- 14 juveniles were released to court custody.\n\n--- 35 received political asylum.\n\n--- 55 were released on bond or INS parole.\n\n--- Two received artist's visas.\n\n--- 53 were paroled in February 1997, but were not awarded legal status.\n\n--- 111 were deported, including 12 who found political asylum in Latin America.\n\n--- Of the 111 deported, it's believed that about half again have returned to the U.S. illegally.\n\nOf some of those locally who assisted the men detained at York County Prison:\n\n--- Jeff Lobach is still practicing law in York. He remains close to several of the former detainees and considers their children his grandchildren.\n\n--- Craig Trebilcock, after serving overseas deployments with the U.S. Army Reserve in Bosnia and Iraq, won election to the York County Court of Common Pleas in 2011.\n\n--- Beverly Church is retired and living in Florida, where she continues to lobby on behalf of the Golden Venture detainees.\n\n--- Joan Maruskin is director of the Church World Service's immigration and refugee program. She is also author of \"Immigration and the Bible: A Guide for Radical Welcome,\" published in 2012.\n\n--- Mary Weaver, former senior legislative assistant and immigration specialist to U.S. Rep. Todd Platts, R-York County, serves as executive director of the Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center, which provides services to immigrants navigating the immigration system.\n\nWhat about the ship?\n\nThe Golden Venture was auctioned off and put back into service as a freighter, renamed the United Caribbean. In August 2000, it was towed off the coast of Boca Raton, Fla., and deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef, becoming popular with scuba divers.\n\nIt was broken apart by the hurricanes of 2005 and now lies scattered on the ocean floor.\n\nSources: The documentary film, \"Golden Venture,\" Patrick Radden Keefe's \"The Snakehead,\" and original reporting.\n\nRelated\n\nCongressional efforts to help detainees remain unsuccessful.\n\nTimeline of events.\n\nZehao Zhou: York responded to plight of detainees", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/20/corrections-clarifications-archive/30417315/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications: Archive", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nTo report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor Brent Jones:\n\nPlease indicate whether you're responding to content online or in the newspaper.\n\nThe following USA TODAY corrections and clarifications were published between October 2012 and December 2014 :\n\nDecember 2014\n\nNews: A Dec. 19 article on Fidel Castro misstated the year of the Cuban missile crisis.

Not only did the state fail to meet a two week decline in cases, but it actually reported an increase in cases per day a week before reopening. According to Johns Hopkins data, Florida reported 594 cases on May 10. Five days later there were more than 800 cases.\n\nAbout three weeks later, on June 5, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ went on to phase two reopening, even as daily cases have topped the 1,000 mark and have continued to do so for the past seven days.\n\nA record 1,698 cases of COVID-19 were announced Thursday morning by the Florida Department of Health, marking the largest single-day increase in the state since the pandemic began.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee said Wednesday that state's recent “uptick” in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations was an expected result of the state reopening much of its economy and urged residents to redouble precautions to prevent the virus from continuing to spread.\n\nGeorgia is notably not on the list of states where cases are on the rise, said Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, professor of environmental health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Gov. Brian Kemp was heavily criticized when the Peach State became one of the first states to begin reopening in April.\n\n'Pandemic is still here':'Pandem100,000 more Americans could die in coming months; USA hits 2M cases\n\nIn the six weeks since Georgia loosened restrictions, its curve has stayed relatively flat. Shaman said this could be due to resident behavior, suggesting people continued to shelter in place despite the lifting of lockdowns.\n\nIt's hard to know for sure because there's no real data on how many businesses truly reopened or what percentage of people actually wear masks, he said.\n\nHowever, Georgia Public Health reported the results of 7,684 tests Tuesday, of which 9.8% were positive, nearly double the rate from the previous day, according to an analysis by the August Chronicle.\n\n“We don’t want to be totally caught up in a numbers game,” Monto said. “What we need to look at is patterns.”\n\nCoronavirus community outbreaks\n\nBoth Monto and Shaman say another reason some states may be experiencing unexpected spikes is because of “super spreaders,” events or enclosed community outbreaks.\n\nA super spreader is an infected person who can transmit the disease to a large number of people.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of anecdotes and it’s hard to define who a super spreader is, you only know after the fact,” he said.\n\nLet them out:Advocates want inmates granted parole freed as COVID-19 stalks prisons\n\nCOVID-19 was Paul Manafort's ticket home: Many other old, ill, nonviolent inmates are still in prison\n\nOther states say their spike is due to a local outbreak in a confined space such as a nursing home, prison or meatpacking plant.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services attributes the state's spike in coronavirus cases to increased testing in prisons.\n\nAccording to the Texas Tribune, the number of prisoners reported to be infected with the virus jumped from about 2,500 to 6,900 in the two weeks since prisons started reporting test results May 26. Overall cases jumped by 34% from May 25 to June 7, and nearly a quarter of the increase came from 10 counties with prisons and meatpacking plants.\n\n“You have clusters, you have nursing homes, meat packing and they add a lot of cases,” Monto said. “So that has to be factored in as well.”\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases tied to meatpacking plants has more than doubled since President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act in late April to compel slaughterhouses and processing plants to stay open.\n\nThe Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting found more than 20,400 infections across 216 plants in 33 states.\n\nAcross the United States, some of the highest spikes in coronavirus cases recently occurred in counties with one or more meatpacking plants – Buena Vista County, Iowa; Beadle County, South Dakota; Yell County, Arkansas; and Titus County, Texas, for example. All saw their case counts more than double in the past two weeks, a USA TODAY data analysis found.\n\nStates catching up to the pandemic\n\nNot much is known about the virus’s seasonality as it has only been present for the past six months. But if it’s anything like the flu, Monto says, it could come in waves.\n\n“I think ‘catching up’ is a phenomenon,” he said. “If you miss the first wave, you catch up in the second wave.”\n\nWith the flu, there’s a lull in the summer, Monto says. States that aren’t impacted in the spring by the seasonal virus usually see a spike in flu infections in a second wave.\n\nAre more store closings coming?:As many as 25,000 stores could shutter in 2020 due to COVID-19 impact\n\nHowever, there is no data to support this hypothesis with the coronavirus. In fact, seasonality doesn’t seem to be a factor, as hot southern states like Arizona and New Mexico are now experiencing a spike in cases.\n\nIn Greenville County, South Carolina, the percentage of positive cases recently tripled from 2.9% on May 27 to 9.4% on June 3, prompting state health officials to classify it a coronavirus “hot spot,” according to The Greenville News.\n\nShaman said a spike in cases could be due to lack of social distancing, face mask wearing and other non-pharmaceutical prevention methods touted by public health experts for the last six months.\n\n“If you look at the protests you can see the difference between communities,” Shaman said. “In New York, everyone is wearing a face mask and others aren’t.”\n\nWhile an increase in cases may be caused for multiple reasons, Monto said states should take heed and take preventative measures to prevent a major outbreak.\n\n“The take home message to me is that the virus is still around. It’s everywhere, it’s not going to go away,” he said. “We can’t be complacent.”\n\nContributing: Brett Kelman, USA TODAY Network\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Russia 24 (Russian state TV)\n\n“Right now, I’m just very, very concerned – also knowing that she’s been there for quite some time,” Elonu told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nShe described feeling detached from much of the world while living in Russia. “Being in Russia, I was kind of in a bubble,” Elonu said.\n\n“I didn’t feel unsafe. I felt as if there was not much happening in that country. I know there was a lot going on outside of the country. But as far as when I was in Russia, we weren’t getting much news about what was happening. Aside from my family and friends and my agent, they were letting me know about what was happening. But it was hard to balance what was actually happening and what I felt,” she said.\n\n“But once things started escalating, my agent was definitely pushing for me to get out. And I’m glad I listened to his advice and got out.”\n\n‘There are no words to express this pain’\n\nGriner’s whereabouts aren’t publicly known. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment but has not heard back.\n\nA member of Russia’s Federal Customs Service described the charge against Griner to Russia 24, the country’s main state-owned news channel.\n\n“A criminal case has been opened against an American citizen under section 2 of 229 YK RF (Russian law) for smuggling of a significant amount of drugs,” Irina Begisheva of the Main Directorate for the Fight Against Smuggling of the Federal Customs Service told Russia 24.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Griner’s wife described the agony of waiting.\n\n“People say ‘stay busy.’ Yet, there’s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.” Cherelle Griner posted Monday.\n\n“There are no words to express this pain. I’m hurting, we’re hurting.”\n\nOver the weekend, she thanked supporters and asked for privacy “as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.”\n\nBut a member of the US House Armed Services Committee said “it’s going to be very difficult” to get Griner out of Russia.\n\n“Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,” Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday.\n\n“Perhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don’t know.”\n\nHe also noted that “Russia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws” – though it’s not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner’s case. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.”\n\nGriner’s high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she worries Griner’s case will be used for political purposes.\n\n“My biggest fear is that … she will become a political pawn,” Jackson told CNN.\n\nBut the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner’s hometown of Houston, said she raised the issue of Griner’s detainment and the “need for her to be immediately released and for her to receive the help of the United States to demand and facilitate that release,” in that meeting with the President, according to a statement Tuesday.\n\nA storied career\n\nGriner has spent her entire WNBA career with the Phoenix Mercury and won the league’s championship in 2014. The WNBA has confirmed that all other league players have departed Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLike many other WNBA players, Griner plays overseas in the offseason where salaries can be much higher than what female professional basketball players are paid in the US.\n\nShe won the EuroLeague Women championship last year with Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she has played since 2015 during her offseasons.\n\nFans around the world have called for Griner’s release, with more than 34,000 people signing the “Secure Brittney Griner’s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.” petition on Change.org as of Tuesday.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Holly Yan", "Travis Caldwell", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/18/panda-versary-prison-tattoo-artist-conch-republic-news-around-states/50084859/", "title": "Panda-versary, prison tattoo artist: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Southern Poverty Law Center unveiled an interactive statue at the downtown Civil Rights Memorial Center on Tuesday. The Blank Slate Monument, created by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, contests the narratives that Civil War memorials present. It is is described as “a reimagining of the American monument; interrogating the traditional white supremacist commemoration of the American Civil War.” A digital sign within the piece allows users to change its message using their phones. “The Civil Rights Memorial Center is honored to bring the Blank Slate Monument to Alabama and specifically Montgomery – a city critical to the civil rights movement and a city continuing to respond to injustices of today,” said Tafeni English, CRMC director. “This monument serves as a reminder of the continued struggle for the liberation of Black people and the importance of preserving the truthful, rich history of Black Americans.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The board tasked with drawing the state’s political boundaries has approved new Alaska Senate districts for the Anchorage area, with two members expressing opposition. The Alaska Redistricting Board adopted the plan, 3-2, on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The board had gone back to work after the state Supreme Court ruled that a Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The new plan would join part of the Eagle River area with south Anchorage and Girdwood for one Senate district and another part of the Eagle River area to an area that includes a military base for another Senate district. The board’s dissenting members said the plan would improperly give Eagle River greater representation in the Senate. “This is still gerrymandering, just in a different way, in my mind,” board member Melanie Bahnke said. The board had been considering two options to address concerns raised by the court. The other option would have joined the Eagle River area’s two House districts into one Senate district. Two House districts make up one Senate district. If the new plan is upheld, Republican Sens. Lora Reinbold, of Eagle River, and Roger Holland, of Anchorage, would be in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Prosecutors have asked the state Supreme Court to call off an upcoming hearing scheduled by a lower-court judge to determine the mental fitness of a prisoner to be executed in what would be Arizona’s first use of the death penalty in nearly eight years. Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office told the state’s highest court in a filing Wednesday that the May 3 mental competency hearing scheduled in Pinal County for death-row prisoner Clarence Dixon is likely to delay his May 11 execution. Dixon was sentenced to death for his murder conviction in the 1977 killing of Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin. The prosecutors are seeking to throw out the lower court’s order that concluded defense lawyers had shown reasonable grounds for planning a hearing over whether Dixon is psychologically fit. Dixon’s lawyers have said their client erroneously believes he will be executed because police at Northern Arizona University wrongfully arrested him in a previous case – a 1985 attack on a 21-year-old student. His attorneys concede he was in fact lawfully arrested then by Flagstaff police. Dixon was sentenced to life sentences in that case for sexual assault and other convictions. DNA samples taken while he was in prison later linked him to Bowdoin’s killing, which at that point had been unsolved.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: U.S. Sen. John Boozman raised $1.1 million over the past three months for his reelection campaign as he continued to surpass his rivals in fundraising for the Republican primary next month, according to federal fundraising records. Boozman’s campaign reported having $2.5 million on hand at the end of March after spending $2.1 million during the first quarter. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file quarterly fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Boozman, first elected to the Senate in 2010, has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump and the state’s top Republicans. Jake Bequette, a former NFL and Arkansas Razorbacks player challenging Boozman, reported raising nearly $344,000 during the quarter and spending almost $200,000. Bequette’s campaign had more than $555,000 on hand. A super PAC supporting Bequette’s bid also spent more than $1.1 million on television ads. Another Senate hopeful, conservative activist and former TV reporter Jan Morgan, raised more than $215,000 during the quarter. Morgan’s campaign spent $221,000 and had $54,751 on hand. Stuttgart pastor Heath Loftis gave his Senate campaign more than $20,000 and raised another $1,100. Loftis had $1,560 on hand.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A spring storm brought several feet of snow to the Sierra Nevada and rain to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, with more stormy weather expected this week. The seven-day snow total topped 3 feet in some mountain areas as of Saturday, UC Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab reported. “We’re getting a bit of an abundant April!” the research station in Soda Springs said on Twitter. Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierra reported a foot of fresh snow. The resort has said it would remain open to skiing and snowboarding until Memorial Day. Lake Tahoe resorts also reported significant snowfall. Drivers heading up to the mountains were urged to use caution because of slippery conditions. Parts of Northern California including the Bay Area could see pockets of rain for much of the week thanks to an unsettled weather pattern stalling over the region, the National Weather Service said. The welcome precipitation could help slow the start of the fire season but won’t do anything to alleviate the state’s drought, said Matt Mehle with the weather service office in San Francisco. “What this rain is doing is bringing moisture and allowing grasses and finer fuels to grow and green up,” Mehle told the San Francisco Chronicle. “It will alleviate fire concerns, at least for the short term.”\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A judge ruled Friday that a man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still mentally incompetent to stand trial, further delaying court proceedings in the case. But the judge also said that assessment could change soon. Experts at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo have said there is a substantial probability that Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 22, can be restored to competency within the “reasonable future” and remain competent by taking medications, Judge Ingrid Bakke said during a brief hearing. It is a prognosis she first mentioned in a March 11 scheduling order. The prosecution of Alissa has been on hold since December, when Bakke first ruled he was mentally incompetent – unable to understand legal proceedings and work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa is being treated at the state mental hospital and was not in court for Friday’s hearing. The judge set a July 21 hearing to again evaluate Alissa’s competency to stand trial. Bakke’s ruling came nearly a month after Boulder, the home of the University of Colorado, marked the first anniversary of the attack that killed workers, customers and a police officer who rushed inside the store.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will be getting back the $75,000 in fines he paid to a court for failing to appear at a deposition last month in a lawsuit over his assertions that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax, a judge has ruled. Relatives of some of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 Newtown massacre sued Jones for defamation, saying they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers. A judge found Jones liable for damages, and a trial on how much he should pay the families is set for August. Judge Barbara Bellis in Waterbury ordered the return of the money Thursday because Jones eventually did show at a rescheduled deposition. The fines, which escalated daily, were aimed at making sure Jones did appear for questioning. Jones said he missed the March 23-24 deposition in Austin, Texas – home to Jones and Infowars – because of a medical problem that included vertigo. He said his doctors first thought it was a serious heart issue, but it later turned out to be a sinus infection. Bellis said there wasn’t enough evidence Jones was too ill to attend the deposition. Jones paid a $25,000 daily fine for April 1 and another $50,000 daily fine for April 4. He then attended a deposition in Bridgeport on April 5-6.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Wilmington University will continue to prioritize science, technology, engineering and mathematics education as the school announced its partnership with Futures First Gaming, which will create degree and certificate pathways for students in the esports and gaming communities. The partnership announced April 11 will provide students with education and training in a variety of areas that pertain to the esports industry. “The agreement between WilmU and FFG leverages the capabilities of both to ensure there’s academic rigor that benefits students with and without esports and game design credentials,” Scott Shaw, assistant professor and academic chair of WilmU’s Game Design program, said in a press release. “There’s so much more to it beyond programming and game design, and this agreement provides pathways to educational credit for skill-building, and opportunities to gain a wider perspective of the industry.” FFG was co-founded in February 2020 by CEO Stephen Sye, who said the company’s goal was to spread the reach of esports, a form of competition using video games, to the state of Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fifty years after pandas first took up residence in the nation’s capital, the Smithsonian National Zoo celebrated the “Panda-versary” with its beloved bears Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their baby Xiao Qi Ji – which means “little miracle” – enjoyed a fruit-and-ice cake as part of the commemoration. The first pair of pandas arrived in D.C. on April 16, 1972, thanks to a deal between first lady Patricia Nixon and the Chinese premier. Since then, the mammals have become the most popular attraction at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Their 50 years have improved relations with China through what’s been called “panda diplomacy,” bolstering conservation efforts and ingraining the bears into Washington’s identity. “For me, the birth of Xiao Qi Ji was pretty spectacular,” said the zoo’s chief curato,r Brian Amaral. “During my entire (five-year) tenure here, we’ve tried to have panda cubs, and for various reasons that we are not sure of, we were not successful, but August of 2020 changed all that, so that was pretty amazing.” In 2021, pandas were downgraded from endangered to vulnerable status by Chinese conservation officials, although they still face many threats, including the threat of climate change to the bamboo forests where they live.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The 40th anniversary celebration of the Florida Keys’ symbolic secession from the United States, motivated by a 1982 U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint established on the only road connecting the Keys with mainland Florida, has begun in Key West. The 10-day Conch Republic Independence Celebration kicked off Friday with a waterfront ceremony at the island city’s Mallory Square. The offbeat republic was born April 23, 1982, shortly after a Border Patrol checkpoint was erected at the top of the Florida Keys Overseas Highway, the lower end of U.S. Highway 1. Agents ostensibly searched departing cars for drugs and other contraband. The obstacle created a miles­long traffic jam that enraged Keys officials, visitors and residents. After appeals to remove the roadblock were denied by federal officials, Key West’s then-Mayor Dennis Wardlow led local leaders in staging the tongue-in-cheek secession, proclaiming the independent Conch Republic and raising its royal blue flag. “We made the announcement that if we’re going to be treated as a foreign country, then we will become a foreign country,” said Wardlow, who was named the republic’s first “prime minister.” The roadblock was subsequently removed, and the eccentric “nation” is now internationally recognized as the Florida Keys’ irreverent alter ego. “It’s been 40 years, and the people are still supporting the republic,” Wardlow said after Friday’s ceremony. “And the government has not put up any border checkpoints, and they haven’t messed with us.” Festivities will continue through April 24 with events including a pirates’ ball, a wacky drag queen footrace and a sailing regatta that recalls the Keys’ seafaring heritage.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The police chief will retire this summer as the city struggles to tamp down its rising homicide rate and as residents on the north side of the city consider seceding to form their own entity, largely over crime concerns. Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant will retire in June, and a nationwide search for his replacement will be conducted, Mayor Andre Dickens’ office announced Friday. “As Mayor Dickens plans his leadership strategies for this great city, I believe it is essential that he and the city of Atlanta have a Chief of Police who is willing to serve throughout his term,” Bryant said in a statement. When he took office, the mayor said he would assess Bryant’s performance in his first 100 days before deciding whether to keep him long term or search for a new chief, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Dickens said he’s looking for a leader who shares his vision for the city. “I am thankful that the chief agreed to stay on for my first 100 days as Mayor, and I have grown to rely on the Chief’s counsel during our daily meetings,” Dickens said in the statement. “We will miss the Chief’s leadership as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.” Bryant, an Atlanta native, joined the department in 1988 and rose to become a major in 2010 and a deputy chief in 2014. Bryant was named the department’s interim chief in June 2020.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A COVID-19 omicron variant hybrid called XE has been detected in the state, the Hawaii Department of Health said. The department’s laboratories division confirmed one case of XE in its latest coronavirus variant report, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The hybrid contains genetic material from both BA.1 and BA.2 variants. The department found it in a sample collected last month. The XE subvariant is believed to be about 10% more transmissible than BA.2, which itself is about 30% more contagious than the original omicron. It was first detected in the United Kingdom. Infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said XE doesn’t appear to have more severe effects than other versions of the virus. A recombinant variant occurs when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within the patient’s body, according to the UK Health Security Agency. It’s not unusual for this to happen, the agency said in a news release. XE is a recombinant lineage of BA.1 and BA.2, with the majority of its genome, including the gene encoding for the spike protein, coming from BA.2, the report said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Friday that he won’t participate in debates heading into next month’s Republican primary. The first-term governor had been invited to participate in debates put on by Idaho Debates on Idaho Public Television and by KTVB-TV. “Governor Little has a proven track record of cutting red tape, responsibly managing the budget and the economy, and providing Idaho families and businesses with historic tax relief and record investments in schools, roads, water, and other areas,” his campaign said in a statement. “Those historic accomplishments and facts are non-debatable.” Little has drawn several Republican challengers, including far-right Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The governor and lieutenant governor run on separate tickets. Little has a significant fundraising advantage, and debating McGeachin in a statewide televised debate could give her a big platform with not much to gain for himself. The two have sparred during the coronavirus pandemic, with McGeachin as acting governor issuing several executive orders while Little was out of town. Little rescinded McGeachin’s orders each time upon his return. McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, tweeted that Little’s decision wasn’t based on “a scheduling conflict” and said he was “showing his elitist attitude.” After Little’s announcement, Idaho Debates officials said it was unclear if the governor’s debate would be held without Little, and they were conferring with other candidates. They said it was the first time in more than three decades that a sitting governor seeking reelection had declined to participate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A fire that roared through a prominent church on the South Side was sparked by a propane torch on the building’s roof, the Chicago Fire Department said Saturday. “The CFD Office of Fire Investigation has determined the fire at Antioch Church to be accidental and caused by work being done on the building roof using a propane torch,” the department said on Twitter. The multiple-alarm fire blaze at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church began after 2 p.m. Friday, an hour after services ended, and wasn’t brought under control for 90 minutes. Exactly three years prior, the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was severely damaged after a fire broke out beneath its roof. “This church is an anchor in this community,” Antioch’s pastor, the Rev. Gerald Dew, told reporters at the scene. “If we’ve got to lose something, losing it on Good Friday is the best time to lose it because after Good Friday comes Resurrection Sunday.” No one appeared to be inside at the time of the fire, Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. About 150 firefighters and 50 engines, trucks and ambulances went to the scene, he said. The only reported injury was a firefighter who slipped on the street, injured his ankle and was taken away in an ambulance, Langford said. The South Side church is well-known for its political clout and community involvement, investing in several housing projects starting in the 1960s. It provides over 1,500 units of affordable housing for seniors, the physically handicapped and for families, Dew said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana State Fair will celebrate the state’s automotive heritage this year. Fairgoers can expect to see iconic celebrity cars from movies and books and world-class classic car collections showcasing Indiana-made vehicles, the fair announced this past week. During the first decades of the 20th century, more than 250 automobile manufacturers opened in the state, including Duesenberg, Stutz, Cord, Auburn and Studebaker, according to Indiana Landmarks, a historic preservation group. This year’s fair will run from Friday, July 29, through Sunday, Aug. 21. It’s closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Hundreds of American white pelicans are visiting the Iowa River, delighting the city’s residents with their snowy feathers and prominent yellow bills. “They are a big white bird that from behind looks like a swan,” said Anna Burkhardt-Thomas, the state’s top bird expert within the Iowa Department of Natural Resources wildlife diversity staff. “That really long yellow beak with a pouch for fish is a key feature.” For more than a week, the pelicans have been swimming in and flying around the Iowa River as far south as Terry Trueblood Recreation Area all the way north to the Coralville Lake. Large clusters of the birds loiter south of the dam in downtown Iowa City, where turbulent water stirs up fish. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports this Midwest spring break is part of the pelicans’ migration from their winter habitat on the Gulf Coast shores to Minnesota or Canada, where they will spend the summer, Burkhardt-Thomas said. But pelicans don’t always come through Iowa in such large numbers, and they don’t always stay so long. “They might stick around longer if they are finding a good food source,” she said. American white pelicans have black flight feathers on the underside of their wings only visible when their wings are open. The birds have a 9-foot wingspan – larger than brown pelicans found near the ocean.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State funds for public schools have been held up as Republican lawmakers push for policies critics say would punish educators for court rulings that forced the GOP-controlled Legislature to boost its spending. A legislative proposal ties $6.4 billion in spending to policies pushed by conservative Republicans, including an “open enrollment” proposal to allow parents to send their children to any public school with enough space. Another provision would restrict surveys of students’ families, their beliefs, mental health, or drug or alcohol abuse. A third would expand a state-funded college scholarship program to students outside Kansas. Republicans drafted the measure before lawmakers began their annual spring break earlier this month, to settle differences between the House and Senate. When legislators reconvene April 25, they must decide whether to add more money for special education programs and whether to link dollars to policy changes. Conservatives argue they are trying to make schools more accountable for how they spend state money. They’ve been linking money to policy since 2014, when the Kansas Supreme Court issued the first of seven rulings in an education funding lawsuit filed against the state by four school districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A jury has awarded $450,000 to a man who sued his employer after he asked that it not celebrate his birthday at work, and colleagues did it anyway. Kevin Berling told his manager at Gravity Diagnostics in Covington in 2019 that a birthday celebration would cause him immense stress, citing bad childhood memories surrounding his parents’ divorce. But the company didn’t heed his request, and Berling suffered a panic attack. The next day he had another panic attack when his supervisor chastised him for “stealing his co-workers’ ” joy and “being a little girl,” according to a lawsuit. Berling was fired after the second attack. He alleged in his lawsuit that the company discriminated against him based on a disability and retaliated against him for demanding a reasonable accommodation to it. The jury returned the verdict after a two-day trial in Kenton County that ended in late March. The jury awarded him $300,000 for emotional distress and $150,000 in lost wages. An attorney for the company, Katherine Kennedy, said it continues to deny liability and is pursuing its post-trial options. Brazil said her employees, rather than the plaintiff, were the victims in the case. Berling’s attorney, Tony Bucher, said once the jury got to meet his client, they realized the company’s claim that he posed a threat was far-fetched.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaurice: A high school senior who lost her best friend in a head-on collision is on a mission to improve safety on Highway 167. Emma Hebert and Ramsie Baumgardner both attended North Vermillion High, and Baumgardner became the third high schooler killed on that highway in the past four years. She was 18. Some sections of the state highway are uneven and unlit. Hebert is one of the people in the Maurice community fighting for change. She joined others at a Vermilion Parish Police Jury meeting in February to discuss adding lights and other ways to increase safety, but she left feeling as if nothing would be done. “I wanted (action), so nobody else has to go through what we went through,” Hebert said. She turned her final paper for her dual-enrollment English class into a persuasive argument to put lights and better signage on the highway. “The lack of lighting and signage on highway 167 makes it perilous, and it is imperative that state and local authorities take action to prevent head-on collisions,” Hebert wrote. She collected police data on highway crashes and learned about the dangers and prevalence of impaired driving. The information fills a large binder, along with more than 1,100 responses to an online survey she posted last month. More than half of those responding identified as 16 to 22 years old. Most were fine with the highway during the day, but a resounding majority said they felt unsafe at night. The main difference is lighting, Herbert said.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The trail network at Acadia National Park is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service said Thursday that the listing recognizes 109 trails that cover 117 miles. The network becomes the largest system of trails listed on the register. The park service said the trail system was recognized because of its historic significance and ties to the history of Mount Desert Island, where the park is located. Kevin Schneider, superintendent of Acadia National Park, said in a statement that the recognition “is a testament to not only the historic significance of these trails, but also the incredible dedication of the National Park Service staff, partners and volunteers who continue to preserve them.” The park service worked for several years to nominate the trails to the register. It was approved last week.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A container ship longer than three football fields has finally been pried from the muddy bottom of the Chesapeake Bay more than a month after it ran aground. After two unsuccessful attempts to dislodge it and the subsequent removal of roughly 500 of the 5,000 containers it was carrying, the Ever Forward was refloated just before 7 a.m. Sunday by two barges and five tugboats. A full moon and high spring tide helped provide a lift to the salvage vessels as they pulled and pushed the massive ship from the mud, across a dredged hole and back into the shipping channel. Once refloated, the Ever Forward was weighed down again by water tanks to ensure safe passage under the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on its way to an anchorage off Annapolis, The Baltimore Sun reports. Marine inspectors will examine the ship’s hull before the Coast Guard allows it to return to the Port of Baltimore to retrieve the offloaded containers. The cargo ship, operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp., was traveling from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, on March 13 when it ran aground just north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Officials have said the grounding did not result in reports of injuries, damage or pollution. The Coast Guard has not said what caused the Ever Forward to run aground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation outlining steps the state needs to take to meet its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 cleared a key hurdle late Thursday when the Massachusetts Senate voted 37-3 to approve the sweeping climate bill. The bill’s passage sets the stage for negotiations with the House, which last month passed its own, more narrowly focused bill. Both Democratic-led chambers hope to come up with a single compromise proposal to ship to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker before the end for the Legislature’s formal session on July 31. The Senate bill tries to address climate change in three areas: renewable energy, transportation and buildings. The bill would set aside $100 million for an investment fund to support the clean energy industry while updating the process of bringing more offshore wind energy online. It would allow solar panels on agricultural and horticultural land and supporting emerging technologies like nuclear fusion, networked geothermal and deep geothermal energy. It would also increase to $3,500 the rebate for the purchase of many zero-emission passenger cars and light-duty trucks, offer another $1,000 for buyers trading in an internal combustion vehicle, deploy more car charging stations across the state, and require new developments to allocate 10% of parking spaces to charging stations. The bill aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the construction of buildings by letting a handful of communities participate in two demonstration projects.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Four Michiganders – a taxidermist, his wife and two mink farm employees – were infected with a unique coronavirus strain connected to minks, leading state health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conclude they likely contracted the first known U.S. cases of so-called animal-to-human virus spillover. Michigan’s four mink-connected COVID-19 cases, the only known animal-to-human cases in the U.S. to date, infected more people than was previously known. The Detroit Free Press and the Documenting COVID-19 project first reported on the mink cases in April 2021, after discovering details about them in Freedom of Information Act requests, and National Geographic confirmed last month that four cases with the same genetic mutations had been linked together. All four people fully recovered. There have been other animal-to-human COVID-19 cases documented with white-tailed deer in Canada and a hamster in Japan. While Michigan’s cases are the only known animal-connected COVID-19 cases in the U.S., there could be other cases that have gone unreported, as the country is not actively testing for such outbreaks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State corrections officials are looking to launch a prison tattoo program in hopes of curbing bloodborne diseases as inmates ink themselves with homemade tools. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the Corrections Department is searching for an experienced tattoo artist to oversee tattoo studios in state prisons. The aim is to slow the spread of diseases like hepatitis C that can spread when inmates try to tattoo themselves or each other with unsterilized tools like electric motors and ballpoint pens and share contaminated needles. Corrections spokesman Nick Kimball said as of January, anywhere from 1,200 to 3,500 of the prison system’s 7,511 inmates were infected with hepatitis C. The prison system treats about 80 to 100 inmates for the disease each at a cost ranging from $20,000 to $75,000 per inmate.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: Technology donations are giving a boost to a nonprofit organization that provides education programs for Hispanic residents. El Centro, in Tupelo, is receiving three years of free internet access and a $50,000 grant from AT&T and 15 computers from Dell Technologies, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. “It opens up a lot more possibilities for us and for us to be able to tell the community, ‘Whatever you have a need for, we can provide it,’ ” El Centro Director Allen Bradford said Thursday of the donation. El Centro, started in 2006, provides free after-school tutoring and services, adult English classes and workshops on topics relevant to the community. The computers came with a free digital learning platform, free digital literacy courses and workshops created with the Public Library Association. El Centro becomes one of more than 20 Connected Learning Centers that AT&T is opening nationwide. The company created its Connected Learning program in response to COVID-19 and the need to bridge the digital divide, said AT&T Mississippi president Mayo Flynt. El Centro helps K-6 students with homework because it can be difficult for students who grow up in bilingual homes and communities, Bradford said. During the pandemic, some fell behind when learning at home.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: City Council member Mike Huff is suing to retain his seat after one of the winning candidates died shortly after the election. Huff was one of four candidates who ran for two council seats in the April 5 election. He came in third, behind fellow member Karen DeLuccie and newcomer Jared Fears. DeLuccie died of cancer April 12, the same day the election results were certified. In a lawsuit filed Thursday, Huff said the Jackson County Election Board and the Independence city clerk should not have certified DeLuccie as the winner because she was incapacitated by her illness, The Kansas City Star reports. Huff argues he should be declared the winner of the second at-large seat. DeLuccie’s family said after her death that her lung cancer prognosis in early February was positive. But after a scan April 7, two days after the election, showed that treatments had not worked, she decided to stop treatment and spend time with her family. Sara Zorich, a director at the Jackson County Election Board, said the city will have to decide how to proceed. The City Council is expected to vote this week on whether to hold a special election.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped 0.3 percentage points in March to 2.3% as it continued to hit new record lows, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Friday. The number of unemployed people in the state fell to 13,106 – a decline of 1,162 people from February. Montana’s unemployment rate in recent months has been the lowest since records started being kept in 1976. Also in March, the state’s total employment hit a new high at 545,360 workers. That’s up by more than 3,200 workers compared to February. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.6% in March, down 0.2 percentage points from February’s rate. Inflation has risen 8.5% over the past 12 months, a 40-year high. That’s driven prices sharply higher for purchases including gasoline, airfare, used cars and trucks and fuel oil.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts has signed off on a $900 million property and income tax cut package. Ricketts said the bill will provide nearly $1 billion in annual tax relief once it is fully implemented. The measure will reduce the top individual and corporate income tax rates to 5.84% by 2027. Currently, the highest individual rate is 6.84%, and the top corporate rate is 7.5%. Property owners will also receive a refundable tax credit to reimburse them for some of the taxes they pay to community colleges, and the law will speed up the state’s plan to phase out taxes on Social Security income. That tax will now by eliminated by 2025. Some senators raised concerns how the tax cut will affect the state budget in future years, but lawmakers ultimately passed the package.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state panel has endorsed an agency’s request for funding to expand Gov. Steve Sisolak’s security team. The Board of Examiners’ vote last Tuesday forwards the Department of Public Safety’s request for $373,051 to the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The department wants to expand Sisolak’s security detail to eight positions by adding a sergeant and two officers. A department memo cited “various national threat alerts” and referenced two incidents in which Sisolak and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo were separately accosted and verbally attacked in public. “Recently our own state experienced verbal attacks on elected officials in a public place,” the memo said. “A recent assessment of the Dignitary Protection operation by the Capital Police Chief revealed the need for expanding the protective team. With this being an election year, the need for stronger protective services is critical to protect Governor and First Family.” Sisolak, a Democrat, is running for reelection this year, while Lombardo is a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor. The Board of Examiners consists of Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some business owners struggling to hire workers are lining up behind Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to use $100 million in federal funds to increase the state’s housing stock. In the two months since Sununu announced the initiative, the state’s unemployment rate has fallen to 2.5%, while the vacancy rate for a two-bedroom apartment fell to under 1%. That’s been tough on companies like Boyce Highlands, which makes architectural moldings in Concord and recently acquired a lumber company in Brentwood. “Our plan in five years is to double the size of that operation, but with very limited housing, it’s very difficult to attract good quality workers,” co-owner Brien Murphy said at a news conference Wednesday. While New Hampshire is one of the region’s fastest growing states, the lack of affordable housing continues to be an obstacle, said Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the Department of Business and Economic Affairs. Half of the total would go to developers of multifamily projects with at least five units, with preference given to projects aimed at lower- and middle-income workers. Another $40 million would go to towns and cities, including $30 million to encourage them to approve projects quickly. Another $10 million would help communities update zoning regulations or demolish vacant, dilapidated buildings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Police officers will be allowed to purchase and consume marijuana once it’s officially and legally for sale in the state, just like any other potential customer, under the recreational weed laws passed last year. On Thursday, acting New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a memo alerting police chiefs that law enforcement agencies “may not take any adverse action against any officers because they do or do not use cannabis off duty,” which was codified in the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act. Police officers are barred from possessing or using marijuana while on the clock and from performing any work while under the influence. The marijuana legalization laws allow any employer to maintain a drug-free workplace and puts into place procedures for suspected drug use while on the job. Platkin’s memo reminds police chiefs they have the same rights. But a drug test must accompany a physical examination as well, as THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can stay in the bloodstream for weeks. A positive drug test could mean the police officer smoked a joint on the way to the station or simply ate a cannabis-infused gummy at an off-duty barbecue a month ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An appeals court on Friday uphold a lower court’s rejection of two ranching groups’ challenge to a federal agency’s designation of certain riparian areas of Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico as critical habitat of a mouse species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 designated nearly 22 square miles in the three states as critical habitat of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. The decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a U.S. District Court judge correctly rejected the challenge by two New Mexico ranching groups, the Northern New Mexico Stockman’s Association and the Otero County Cattleman’s Association. Livestock grazing can damage mouse habitat, and its protected status has prompted federal managers in some areas to restrict access to streams and wetlands. The appeals court said the Fish and Wildlife Service complied with legal requirements for assessing economic impacts of critical habitat designation, adequately considered the effects on ranchers’ water rights and “reasonably supported its decision not to exclude certain areas from the critical habitat designation.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former union boss for the nation’s largest correction officers’ union might have gotten too harsh a prison sentence when he was ordered to spend nearly five years behind bars for corruption convictions, a judge said. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who sentenced Seabrook to four years and 10 months in prison in early 2019, said in a ruling Friday that the length of Norman Seabrook’s prison term deserves a second look. He noted disparities in the sentence given to Seabrook, who is Black, and co-conspirators who are white. But he also said in a written ruling that the former head of the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association did not deserve a new trial after his 2018 conviction on conspiracy and honest service wire fraud charges. Prosecutors said he accepted $60,000 in bribes in 2014 to funnel $20 million in union funds to a risky hedge fund. All but $1 million was lost. Seabrook has said there was no evidence he ever intended to “lose a dime” of union members’ money. In October 2021, Seabrook asked Hellerstein to grant him a new trial on several grounds including ineffective assistance of counsel and unjust rulings against him, which Hellerstein said in his Friday ruling all fall “well short of the mark.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Three primates suffered frostbite while enduring subfreezing conditions this year at an exotic animal farm operated by a county commissioner that has been repeatedly cited by federal inspectors. The latest citations, involving a black and white ruffed lemur, a De Brazza’s monkey and a capuchin, were issued in March by the U.S. Department of Agriculture against Zootastic Park of Lake Norman, The Charlotte Observer reports. “The lemur’s hand was injured and remains contracted while the De Brazza’s and capuchin suffered the loss of their tail tips,” according to a copy of the federal inspection report, obtained by the animal welfare group PETA. Scottie Brown, the Iredell County commissioner who owns the park outside Charlotte, didn’t reply to a phone message from the newspaper Thursday. In another instance, the inspector saw a young howler monkey “hugging a live electric cord that was connected to a heating pad inside its enclosure.” That could have hurt or killed the monkey, the inspector wrote. The USDA also cited Zootastic for medicating animals without a veterinarian present, allowing visitors unsupervised access to some animals, and failing to document its purchase or disposal of at least a dozen animals, the inspection reports show.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two North Dakota Army National Guard soldiers are being recognized for saving migrants from drowning at the southern border of the United States last month. Spc. Luis Alvarado, of Bismarck, and Spc. Gracin Clem, of Dickinson, were conducting surveillance for U.S. Customs and Border Protection on March 22 when they observed five migrants attempting to cross the Rio Grande River, the National Guard said. The migrants were halfway across the river but struggled to stay above water due to strong currents and high winds. The two men were equipped with nylon rope lifelines, and Clem swam a line out to help the people that were struggling. The soldiers rescued two people as the other three managed to get to safety. “There wasn’t time to be scared,” Clem said. “It wasn’t an option.” Alvarado and Clem are assigned to the North Dakota National Guard’s 957th Engineer Company and have been part of the southwest border mission since the fall of 2021. “These heroic actions demonstrate the unyielding commitment of our Guard members to preserve lives while in the service of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Al Dohrmann, North Dakota adjutant general. “Our entire chain of command is extremely proud of the actions of all our soldiers.”\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Ohio State University will pay $2 million to settle more lawsuits brought by men who said they were sexually abused decades ago by now-deceased team doctor Richard Strauss, increasing the number of survivors who’ve reached settlement agreements to nearly 290. The payouts by the university have now reached just under $60 million to former athletes and other men who alleged Strauss carried out the abuse at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and an off-campus clinic. The latest settlement announced Friday ends lawsuits brought by 57 survivors whose cases had been dismissed by a federal judge who last year ruled that the legal window for such claims had passed. Dozens of men whose cases were dismissed have appealed that decision and have yet to reach settlements. The hundreds of survivors who have sued the university said it failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at Ohio State as far back as the late 1970s. No one has publicly defended Strauss, who died in 2005. Ohio State has said that a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against the school have revealed more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Republican Scott Pruitt, the scandal-ridden former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, filed Friday to run for Oklahoma’s open U.S. Senate seat, making a return to politics in a state with deep ties to the oil and gas industry. Pruitt, 53, a former Oklahoma attorney general and outspoken supporter of the energy industry, is seeking the seat being vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. While Pruitt was attorney general, he filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the agency he was later picked to lead by ex-President Donald Trump. After arriving in Washington, he worked to dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations that aimed to reduce toxic pollution and planet-warming carbon emissions. Pruitt stepped down as EPA administrator in 2018 amid a wave of ethics scandals, including living in a bargain-priced Capitol Hill condo tied to an energy lobbyist. He also faced ethics investigations into pricey trips with first-class airline seats and unusual security spending, including a $43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls. And he demanded 24-hour-a-day protection from armed officers, resulting in a swollen 20-member security detail that blew through overtime budgets and racked up expenses of more than $3 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials at Oregon Health & Science University have apologized to employees after a fake phishing test drew complaints about raising false hopes. The university sent the phishing test email to employees April 12 offering up to $7,500 in financial assistance, Portland TV station KGW8 reports. The email, from a “benefit@ohsu.edu” address, read in part: “In response to the current community hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon Health & Science University has decided to assist all employees in getting through these difficult times.” It included a link where respondents could “register” for pandemic-related benefits. But the offer was not real – it was a test intended to measure employees’ cybersecurity awareness and OHSU’s own technology systems. The test was sent several days after the university sent a message to employees warning them about suspicious emails. The phishing test was met with frustration from some employees. In a statement, OHSU apologized and said the university didn’t fully consider the harm the phishing test could cause. “This week, as part of OHSU’s regular exercises to help members practice spotting suspicious e-mails, the language in the test e-mail was taken verbatim from an actual phishing e-mail to ensure no one else fell for the scam. That was a mistake,” the OHSU statement said. “The real scam was insensitive and exploitive of OHSU members – and the attempt to educate members felt the same way, causing confusion and concern.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An ad by one of three people seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor this year drew a complaint Friday and a sharply worded letter from the party’s presumed nominee for governor. The dispute pits Attorney General Josh Shapiro against state Rep. Brian Sims over Sims’ ad that the Shapiro campaign says falsely implies Shapiro has endorsed Sims. Shapiro took the unusual step earlier this year of endorsing and running with state Rep. Austin Davis of Allegheny County, even though in Pennsylvania candidates for governor and lieutenant governor are not paired on the primary ballot. So when the Shapiro camp noticed that “ENDORSED JOSH SHAPIRO,” along with a check-marked ribbon, appeared at the end of Sims’ new statewide ad, lawyers fired off a cease-and-desist order. “Not only does the ad mislead voters, it also places Attorney General Shapiro in a false light,” argued Courtney Weisman, a lawyer for Shapiro, in the letter sent Friday. She said Sims’ wording was designed to mislead Pennsylvanians. The ad began running on streaming services in markets around Pennsylvania this past week, Sims’ spokesperson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Environmental Management plans to hire somebody who can recruit hunters and trappers, including women and people from minority communities. “We’re hiring! DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) is looking for an innovative self-starter with a strong human dimensions background to coordinate the state’s efforts to recruit, retain and reactivate (R3) outdoor enthusiasts, specifically hunters, trappers and shooting sportsmen and women,” the department said in a Facebook post. The job, which pays $71,487 for a 35-hour workweek, is consistent with a wider effort to encourage those outdoor sports. License fees for those activities and taxes on equipment help pay for wildlife management and land conservation, but Rhode Island and other states across the nation are seeing a drop in hunting, according to the DEM. “We’ve seen a tremendous decline in the number of people who participate in hunting,” said David Kalb, supervising wildlife biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. For example, Kalb said, the state sold 8,800 hunting licenses last year, a sizable drop from the peak of 11,600 in 2000. Revenue has decreased along with the drop in license sales, Kalb said, although he couldn’t immediately attach a dollar figure to it.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed Friday. Richard Bernard Moore, 57, is the also first South Carolina prisoner to face the choice of execution methods after a law went into effect last year making electrocution the default and giving inmates the option to face three prison workers with rifles instead. Moore has spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. If executed as scheduled April 29, he would be the first person put to death in the state since 2011 and the fourth in the country to die by firing squad in nearly half a century. Only three executions in the United States have been carried out by firing squad since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the center. In a statement, Moore said he didn’t concede that either method was legal or constitutional but more strongly opposed death by electrocution and only chose the firing squad because he was required to make a choice.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrookings: Rural communities are more vulnerable to economic effects from major historical events like the COVID-19 pandemic and recessions than urban communities, according to two local students’ research. Brookings High School seniors Will Hummel and Aditya Tummala will present their study, “The Disproportionate Effect of Labor Force Exodus on Rural America: A Study on the Implications of Pandemic-Era Recessions on Rural Midwest Communities,” next month at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in Atlanta. The May 8-13 fair is the world’s largest international pre-college science competition, hosting more than 1,500 high school students from 75 countries to share science projects of their own design. It will be the third time at the fair for Hummel and fourth time for Tummala, but it’s their first time together as a team. They also took this project to the Eastern South Dakota Science & Engineering Fair at South Dakota State University on March 22, securing the first grand prize award, earning them an all-expense-paid trip to the international fair. Hummel said because rural communities tend to base their economies on things like agriculture, mining or harvesting raw materials, like soybeans and corn, and then shipping those materials out, it leaves them more vulnerable to economic events.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers are advancing a bill strictly limiting the shackling of pregnant inmates. The Republican-led Senate passed the legislation by Democratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari without opposition Thursday. The bill would generally prohibit restraints of a pregnant inmate. More specifically, a pregnant inmate’s ankles, legs or waist couldn’t be shackled during labor or delivery. The legislation also would not allow a pregnant inmate to be shackled behind the back or to be attached to another inmate. Some exceptions allowing restraints on a pregnant inmate would be when the inmate is moved within or outside of a facility, if the inmate is an immediate flight risk, if the inmate poses a self-threat or threat to the fetus or others, or if the classification level of the inmate requires restraints. In those cases, the bill says only the least restrictive restraints necessary should be used. The legislation still needs a vote from the House.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday repealed his traffic-clogging immigration order that backed up commercial trucks at the U.S.-Mexico border, after a week of intensifying backlash and fears of deepening economic losses. The Republican governor dropped his new rules that had required all commercial trucks from Mexico to undergo extra inspections to curb the flow of migrants and drugs and ratcheted up a fight with the Biden administration over immigration policy. Some truckers reported waiting more than 30 hours to cross. Others blocked one of the world’s busiest trade bridges in protest. Abbott, who is up for reelection in November and has made the border his top issue, fully lifted the inspections after reaching agreements with neighboring Mexican states that he said outline new commitments to border security. The last was signed with the governor of Tamaulipas, who earlier in the week said the inspections were overzealous and created havoc. On Friday, he joined Abbott and said they were ready to work together. Pressure was building on Abbott to retreat as gridlock on the border worsened. The American Trucking Association called the inspections “wholly flawed, redundant and adding considerable weight on an already strained supply chain.” One customs agency in Mexico estimated the losses at millions of dollars a day, and produce distributors warned of empty shelves and higher prices if the order was not rescinded soon.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee worked on early efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, helping to push legally dubious schemes to keep then-President Donald Trump in power, before he shifted course and quickly backed away. His efforts, revealed in text messages obtained by the House panel investigating the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, drew quick condemnation Friday from his reelection challengers. Text messages between the Utah senator and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows detail how Lee encouraged top Trump advisers to embrace Sidney Powell, a Republican lawyer who later spread wild and baseless claims of a rigged election. The messages from Lee to Meadows – and messages from Texas U.S. Rep. Chip Roy to Meadows – were reported on and published Friday by CNN. They show Lee’s efforts to assist Trump began Nov. 7 and included early support for Powell. Later, Lee explored a plan to encourage state legislatures to alter the outcome of the 2020 election by appointing alternate electors. At one point, Lee said he was working “14 hour days” assisting Trump. At another he asked Meadows: “Please tell me what I should be saying.” By mid-November, the messages show Lee beginning to lose confidence in Powell and, eventually, the alternate electors plan.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: After 50 years of helping to teach local students how to drive, a local high school’s driver’s education simulators have been put “out to pasture.” John Dunn posted pictures of the simulators languishing outside Essex High School in a Burlington Area History Facebook group last month and was flooded with comments from people who used the machines in school. The simulators, put into use in 1972 and taken out in 2022, were not just the only ones in Vermont – they were the oldest ones of their kind in use anywhere, according to Bill Mayville, who first used one as an EHS student in 1973 and then returned to the school to teach driver’s education for the next 39 years. The simulators were his main teaching tool. “I was sad to see them go, but I knew they were going to go,” he said. When the school first received the 12 simulators, “it was a big deal,” Mayville said. More were planned to come to the state, and Essex even had a driver’s education course planned for a field near the school. But the Nixon-era funds were frozen, according to Mayville, and Essex remained the only program in the state to have the simulators. Vermont State Police also trained on them, and they were used as an evaluation tool for teens with special needs or older adults to determine if they were capable of driving. One was handicap-equipped with full hand controls.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia Commonwealth University has received nearly $1 million in federal funds to study gun violence in the city as it experiences a spike in homicides. The money comes from the Omnibus Appropriations Agreement for the 2022 fiscal year approved by Congress this month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. VCU’s project, the RVA Gun Violence Prevention Framework, aims to create a public health response to addressing the social, economic and systemic factors that lead to gun violence. The project is led by school representatives, VCU Health and the city of Richmond. Last year, Mayor Levar Stoney called gun violence a public health crisis, and the city allocated $133,000 toward the initiative. There were 101 slayings in the city last year, the most since 2004. Most involved guns. Richmond police classified 93 of the killings as homicides. In addition to intentional gun deaths, VCU Health reported last summer that it had seen a surprisingly high number of gun accidents. VCU also received $400,000 for a program seeking to support recruitment and training efforts of early childhood educators across central Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A hovering arctic jet stream has brought biting cold, snow, rain and hail that is concerning growers across central Washington’s Yakima Valley. Grower Mike Saunders with Apple King–Pro Orchard Management said orchards were laden with snow Wednesday, an unusual sight, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Freezing temperatures began early last week with another cold snap expected this week. Growers have been using wind machines and smudge pots to warm the apple, pear and cherry orchards. Washington State Tree Fruit Association spokesperson Tim Kovis said the trees there are in bloom, but the cold is keeping the bees from pollinating, which is the biggest concern. “This is the window that is essential for the bees to be out in the orchards and pollinating those buds for the growing process,” he said. He said it’s still too early to assess the impact and said growers will know more this week. Not all orchards in the state are in the same dilemma, though they are facing freezing temperatures, Kovis said. Chelan, for example, has had snow, but fruit trees there have yet to bud, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Most of the protesters arrested at a power plant linked to U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin have settled trespassing cases. Twelve of the 16 protesters arrested last weekend at the Grant Town Power Plant in Marion County settled cases Friday, the activist group West Virginia Rising said. All 16 were arrested April 9 for trespassing after forming a human chain, The Dominion Post reports. The protest attracted about 200 people to call attention to the plant’s burning of low-grade coal, which emits more pollution. Manchin’s son runs the plant and burns the low-grade coal sold by Enersystems, the senator’s company. Manchin, Democrat, is chairman of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Among the protesters last week was J. Davitt McAteer, the former mine safety chief in the Clinton administration. McAteer said Manchin “appears to be contributing mightily to the problem (of coal pollution) while reaping untold benefits,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: The state Department of Natural Resources is ending its practice of posting volunteer guards along the Wolf River to protect spawning sturgeon from poachers. WLUK-TV reports Sturgeon for Tomorrow has been posting guards along the river around the clock each spring for decades in coordination with the DNR to protect the fish. DNR Regional Conservation Warden Ben Treml said there have been no major complaints or poaching cases for at least 15 years, and coordinating the volunteers is a lot of work, with notable difficulty in finding people willing to work overnight. He added that no volunteers have patrolled the river for the past two years during the pandemic. Jim Patt, president of the southwest chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, said he’s not happy with the DNR’s decision. No one knows how much poaching is really going on, he said, and if word gets around that the guards aren’t on the river, any more poaching could increase.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The West’s oldest horse-drawn parade might become a relic after two years of pandemic-related cancellations. The Old West Days Parade drew just 22 entrants in 2019, when it was last held, and the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce is now trying to decide whether to bring the Memorial Day season event back, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The chamber is asking members of the ranching community to speak up if they want to keep the tradition going, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/michigan/2019/05/27/michigan-farmers-mexico-trade/1220620001/", "title": "Michigan bean farmers depend on Mexico, fear impact of trade war", "text": "The black beans served at dinner all over Mexico likely came from a Michigan farm.\n\nAnd dairy farmers in the Great Lakes State say they’re grateful to families south of the border who drink so much milk they stabilize dairy prices as demand for milk declines in the United States.\n\n“Most people don’t have a clue that we trade so much with Mexico,” said Steve Findlay, 53, a third-generation farmer from Reese who grows sugar beets, black beans, navy beans, soybeans, wheat and corn. “Probably half our black beans go to Mexico. And we’ve worked a lifetime to build this market with Mexico.”\n\nWhile elected officials focus on China, farmers talk about their appreciation for Mexico during this period of trade uncertainty, as Congress considers a revised deal with America's border nations.\n\n“It’s easy to put Canada and Mexico on the back burner, but a majority of our products end up in Canada or Mexico. Asking a Michigan farmer to choose between China and USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) is like asking a parent who their favorite kid is. We need them both,” said Dan Keenan, 36, a fifth-generation farmer from Merrill who grows corn, soybeans, sugar beets and black beans.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Michigan is a major producer of dry edible beans — white, pinto, navy, black. And soybeans? We grew roughly 2.27 million acres in Michigan in 2018. One acre is roughly the size of a football field.\" he said. \"There's a large disconnect between the farm community and the general population.\"\n\nFarmers say they watch how people talk about Mexico and worry.\n\nEverybody wants to see the trade debate in the rearview mirror, Keenan said. “Trade wars have negative effects. Farmers are a resilient bunch but you can only do this for so long. We understood we wouldn’t sneak out without a black eye. We’ve adjusted our budgets and tightened our belts. But the longer this all goes on, the tougher it’s going to be to handle some of these uncertainties.”\n\nGood news came earlier this month, when President Donald Trump lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico and announced the two countries would lift what had been retaliatory tariffs on a number of goods. That was seen as helping clear the way for approval by U.S. and Canadian lawmakers of the new agreement meant to update NAFTA.\n\nWhile that was positive for U.S. automakers, whose material costs went up because of the tariffs, it was a big deal for Michigan farmers, too.\n\n'Every drop'\n\nKen Nobis, 74, is a dairy farmer from St. Johns who raises 1,100 Holstein cows with his brother and his son. Theirs is a legacy of farming in Michigan that goes so far back it was difficult to track generations.\n\n“Every drop of milk produced in this country has to have a home, so exports are very important to us,” he said. “We don’t gain a lot of sales per capita within this country. For our market to grow, we have to look to foreign markets. And Mexico is the No. 1 export customer for dairy in the U.S.”\n\nMost people just don’t understand the economic ties, said Nobis, who has been among farmers traveling back and forth to grow dairy sales south of the border.\n\n“It’s super important to us. They learn things from us. We learn things from them,” he said. “It’s a very cordial relationship. We work together and help each other.”\n\nJose De Nigris, 46, of Clarkston, as president of U.S. operations for Monterey, Mexico-based Katcon, employs 100 workers at the office in Auburn Hills as part of a global operation that designs, engineers and manufactures exhaust systems and catalytic converters. He said trade dialogue and dynamics with Mexico have changed dramatically over the past two years. “It's concerning, not knowing how and when the rules of the game will change.”\n\nFarmers are waiting it out.\n\n“Thing is, black beans don’t qualify for the subsidy payments they talk about,\" Findlay said. \"We just assume this is going to work out. I thought it would be taken care of in March or April. Now the guys are saying it’s going to be next summer.”\n\n'Taken for granted'\n\nMartha Barcena, ambassador of Mexico to the United States, traveled to Michigan on May 13, international outreach she noted hasn’t been done in years, to meet with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Michigan business leaders to remind them of the strong cross-border ties.\n\n“People in Mexico, we understand perfectly well the importance of the U.S. for us, and that our future is tied to the U.S., in all senses — economic, social, cultural,” she said during an interview with the Free Press. “In the U.S., they do not understand this. They think Mexico is not important. Politicians travel to Israel, to Taiwan, to Japan, to Brazil. They do not realize Mexico is much more important. It’s taken for granted.”\n\nBarcena has family ties to Grand Rapids with a great aunt who lived and died on the west side of the state as a Carmelite nun who lived in a cloistered monastery. “She was one of the eldest sisters of my grandfather. Her name as a nun was Maria Isabel.\"\n\nBarcena traveled to Grand Rapids after meetings in Detroit.\n\nDuring the ambassador’s visit, she noted that former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder visited China half a dozen times and never Mexico. She extended an invitation to Whitmer.\n\n“Trade between Mexico and Michigan, which was $68.6 billion in 2018, is almost the same as trade between the whole USA and Brazil,” Barcena said. “The number is impressive. “\n\nIn addition to agriculture, collaborating on automotive manufacturing is essential to survival, she said.\n\n“There is no such thing as a Mexican car or an American car or a Canadian car,\" she said. \"These are North American cars. The automotive industry is totally integrated. Before a car is finally assembled, a part of a car crosses up to eight times across the border among the three countries.”\n\nAlan Deardorff, professor of international economics at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, emphasized, “Mexico is a hugely important trading partner, as is Canada, for the state of Michigan.\"\n\nMore:Worried UAW workers meet with President Trump's top trade official\n\nMore:Faced with 'headwinds,' Ford hires global industry leader as lobbyist\n\nBobby Leddy, deputy press secretary to Whitmer, provided a statement to the Free Press: “Michigan is the second most agriculturally diverse state in the country, exporting more than $200 million in agriculture products to Mexico in 2018. At a time when trade wars are cutting into farmers’ bottom lines, the need to level the playing field for Michigan farmers and provide financial certainty to their families has never been greater. From soybeans to cherries to black beans, Governor Whitmer is a strong partner for our state’s farmers and food producers to identify ways to support economic growth in every corner of our state while protecting our incredible natural resources.\"\n\nImmigration 'misunderstanding'\n\nWhen asked to comment on the sensitive issue of immigration, Barcena said undocumented travel has plummeted and more Mexicans are returning to Mexico than ever. She questioned why America is blaming Mexico for a humanitarian crisis in Central America.\n\n“It’s a huge misunderstanding,\" Barcena said. \"The challenge is both for Mexico and the U.S. because the situation in central America is dire — with no opportunity, problems of insecurity, drought.”\n\nMore than 140,000 jobs in Michigan depend on trade with Mexico in autos and agriculture, she noted.\n\n“And we have a Mexican community in Michigan of almost 400,000,” Barcena said. “Some rhetoric in certain sectors is causing a lot of anxiety to our communities. Children are not attending schools, children are afraid to have their parents attend Parent Teacher Association meetings, children are feeling ashamed because they ask psychologists if their parents are rapists and murders or if their parents are going to be taken to jail. I think that’s unacceptable.”\n\nShe emphasized, “I want to say to the Mexican community: Be proud of your roots. Be proud of how much you contribute to this country. Be proud of how much you contribute to Mexico.”\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

Many of the victims were American college students flying home for Christmas.\n\nFamilies gather to remember Lockerbie bombing victims\n\nIn a statement, the Crown Office said the two countries were asking Libyan authorities to help Scottish detectives and FBI officers interview the suspects in Tripoli.\n\nThe Libyans, whose names were not disclosed, are suspected of involvement with Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the only person convicted in the attack.\n\nAl-Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence officer, was convicted in 2001 of planting the bomb. He was freed from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had cancer — to the outrage of many victims' families.\n\nMemorials mark Lockerbie attack anniversary\n\nAl-Megrahi always denied involvement, and died in Libya in 2012 still protesting his innocence.\n\nThe case is still open, and after the 2011 fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Britain asked Libya's new rulers to help fully investigate. But the country has since been wracked by chaos and political violence.\n\nSome families of Lockerbie victims remain skeptical that al-Megrahi was involved, and backed his long campaign of appeals.\n\nJim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed in the bombing, believes al-Megrahi was wrongly convicted, \"so to try to bolt two more names on top of that is a very difficult situation.\"\n\nHe told the BBC that any new suspects would have to be prosecuted with \"very much better evidence than was used to achieve the conviction of (al-) Megrahi.\"\n\nSouth Jersey’s victims of attack on Pan Am 103:\n\nRichard Monetti, 20, of Cherry Hill, a Syracuse University student returning from a foreign study program in London.\n\nDiane Rencevicz, 21, of Burlington City, a Temple University student who also had been studying in London.\n\nDiane Maslowski, 30, of Haddonfield, a London resident and vice president of a financial trading company.\n\nMichael Doyle, 30, of Voorhees, returning from a business trip in London.\n\nTheodora Cohen, 20, of Port Jervis, N.Y., was a Syracuse student whose parents lived in Cape May Court House.\n\nWilliam Pugh, 56, of Margate, was a businessman.\n\nTwo families that died had South Jersey roots.\n\nRobert Owens, 45; his 44-year-old wife Marty and their daughters, Sarah, 14, and Laura, 8, had moved from Cherry Hill to London four months before the attack.

The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, “had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof.” The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state’s oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 – the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways – buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. “We’re experiencing record high inflation that we haven’t seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn’t have come at a better time for those living on the state’s vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro’s fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man’s Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey’s car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, “ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose.” The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found “two males with bloody faces” at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat’s COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city’s quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco’s lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. “We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,” said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee’s next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November’s election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school’s slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones’ promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they’ve endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. “There are days when grief is just so awful,” said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. “Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn’t exist. That compounds everything.” One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington’s financially ailing operator must pay a ship loading company more than $28million – an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5 million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services – a local ship loading company already doing business at the port – to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer’s local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26 million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer’s officials had carried out “bulldogged” efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, WUSA-TV reports. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. “No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,” one woman said. “I don’t know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,” a man said. “Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,” one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury’s presence, accusing them of being “unprofessional” when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were “the zenith of the cumulative disdain” they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer’s comments didn’t rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge’s “expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger” against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s “Tribal Homelands Initiative,” which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. “This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country’s tribal nations,” Haaland said at last weekend’s 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem. Georgia’s congressional delegation is on board, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has been welcomed as an essential partner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Maui County Council is pushing a resolution that would allow counties to set higher minimum wages than the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Maui leaders endorsed the idea from council member Gabe Johnson, who pointed to variances in the cost of living from one area to another in advocating for the move. Three other county councils would have to approve before the resolution could be considered in the Legislature next year, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho’s plan to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm cleared a big hurdle Tuesday. Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university’s plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state’s dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school’s proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry – Idaho’s is the third largest in the nation – faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn’t been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38 million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325 million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant’s releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant’s most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220 million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100 million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant’s original owner, $5 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared, eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner’s office, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner’s Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner’s office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some “natural” deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. “It’s unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,” said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state law enforcement oversight board reprimanded a sheriff’s deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied in the deputy’s vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas “struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, ‘hog-tied’ and ultimately tased L.H.,” the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky’s history, officials said. Discover Kentucky Archaeology, at archaeology.ky.gov, was launched by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office in partnership with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, a statement from the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said. It includes information on more than 100 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites across 64 counties. The site was launched in September, which is celebrated as Kentucky Archaeology Month. Prehistoric sites include a Native American rockshelter in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and historic sites include Saltpeter Cave, a frontier-era niter mine in Carter County, the statement said. Each archaeological site includes a summary, findings, a focus on “what’s cool” and links to related materials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three small insect-eating raptors called Mississippi kites have been released by Louisiana State University’s wildlife hospital. The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one – brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg – excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital’s director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, “Now I know what these things on my sides are for.” The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge’s decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said this week that they’re appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is “escalating its fight to save Maine’s lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,” said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen’s association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years. The state and the fishermen have appealed their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: A historic inn where President George Washington reportedly once stayed is on the market. The historic Washington Inn & Tavern, the centerpiece of the Eastern Shore town of Princess Anne, is said to have housed the late president, said Town Manager Clayton Anderson. Built in 1744, before America’s independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn & Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the “Bewitched” statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery – as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom – sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was “going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested” and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days. The statue was erected in the city famous for the 1692 witch trials in 2005, despite protests from some who said it trivializes the tragedy of the trials.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city sued the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday over population estimates from last year that show it lost an additional 7,100 residents, opening another front against the agency in a battle over how Detroit’s people have been counted in the past two years. Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau’s refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city’s reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. “The Bureau’s failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City’s historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,” the lawsuit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator. Brendon Daugherty was being held in the Sherburne County Jail, in Elk River, on charges of threatening to murder a U.S. official and interstate transmission of a threat. Court records do not identify the senator other than to say it was not someone who represented Minnesota. According to the indictment, Daugherty left two threatening voicemail messages at the senator’s field office in June. Field office staff contacted U.S. Capitol Police. FBI agents spoke with Daugherty at his Coon Rapids home Sept. 2. He told the agents that he made the calls because the senator was “doing a bunch of stupid (expletive) with gun control” and that he wants politicians to “feel a little bit pressured,” the Star Tribune reports. According to court records, the 35-year-old Daugherty was convicted in October 2018 of two felony counts for threatening to burn down a Pearl Vision store in Maple Grove and harm the employees. Daugherty was angry that he owed $80 for replacement glasses, according to charges.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been awarded a $5.8million grant for the construction of an Advanced Workforce Training Center. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced that the department’s Economic Development Administration is awarding the $5.8 million grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for the construction of the Advanced Workforce Training Center. The grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan’s Indigenous Communities Program, a press release said. “Workforce development is a primary focus for our Tribe,” Chief Cyrus Ben said in the press release. “We have undertaken many projects to help our community members prepare to face a challenging and ever-evolving job market. This Workforce Training Center is a key component of our strategy to increase the skills of our Tribal members, whether they choose a career on or outside of our Tribal lands.” Anna Denson, project manager of economic development, said the planning process took more than a year. “As of today, our National Center for construction education and research offers HVAC, electrical and industrial maintenance to tribal employees with very little room, but the goal is to expand with the new center,” Denson said.\n\nMissouri\n\nHartville: A small hamlet in the Ozarks has found itself in the middle of everything. Officials from the nation’s capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn’t have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation’s population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be “the balance point” if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size – each representing the location of one person – placed on it.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The state’s fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the University of Montana contributed to the new study titled “Socioeconomic resilience to climatic extremes in a freshwater fishery,” which ran in the journal Science Advances this month, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. “Trout fisheries have enormous cultural, economic and ecological importance in Montana and worldwide, yet even Montana’s resilient trout fisheries could be vulnerable to future climate change,” Timothy Cline, a USGS scientist and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. The authors used Montana FWP’s recreation monitoring data to analyze how climate change affected 3,100 miles of the state’s rivers between 1983 and 2017. They found that the concentration of anglers doubled overall within that 34-year time period, and severe drought conditions, which drive stream flows down and water temperatures up, significantly affected how that fishing pressure was distributed across the landscape.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Regents at the University of Nebraska are poised to consider allowing beer sales permanently for Husker events at Pinnacle Bank Arena, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The NU Board of Regents plans to vote on the exemption next week.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: A sprawling southern Nevada county that embraced misinformation about electronic voting machines is set to conduct its midterm election this fall using hand-counted paper ballots, a county official confirmed Tuesday. “This is very locked in,” said newly appointed Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf, a 2020 election denier, of his plans to implement the old-fashioned process in a county with roughly 33,000 active registered voters. Nye, the largest county by area in Nevada and the third-largest in the United States, has been at the forefront of the Republican Party’s push to ditch electronic voting – an ongoing effort fueled by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Now, less than 50 days before the midterm election, the rural county remains committed to that disinformation campaign despite warnings from experts who say counting ballots by hand could invite more error and fraud. All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election, Kampf, the county’s top voting official, said in a presentation Tuesday to Nye’s five-member Board of Commissioners. But at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and “special needs.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is using $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to support homeless shelters this winter. The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6% from 2021. The federal funds will provide $4 million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and $1 million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRidgewood: Will students make it to class more alert and on time if high school starts 45 minutes later? The school district’s parents and teachers were more skeptical than students about any positive outcomes of a later school day start in a 24-page report by K-12 Insights that was presented to the Ridgewood Board of Education on Monday. The report analyzed the results of a district survey distributed in May to parents, students, teachers and community members seeking input about a proposed move of the high school start time from 7:45 to 8:30 a.m. The later starting time is the subject of a nationwide educational debate. Multiple studies indicate it’s not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night – it’s a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be “dazed and confused” in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8 a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill. So far, only a few districts, including Tenafly, Princeton and South Orange/Maplewood, have adopted the later start time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A politician and Trump supporter who was removed and barred from elected office for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, is attempting to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. Cowboys for Trump co-founder and former county commissioner Couy Griffin on Tuesday notified the high court of his intent to appeal. The ruling against Griffin this month from a Santa Fe-based District Court was the first to remove or bar an elected official from office in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol building that disrupted Congress as it was trying to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. “Mr. Acevedo’s tragic passing is an immense loss,” Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb. 27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. “Once again, their system failed,” Acevedo’s attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. “I mean, he shouldn’t have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual.” The state attorney general’s office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner’s office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina’s bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina’s proposal would cover the “University Hub” region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump’s discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state’s high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore “Tore” Maras, who calls President Joe Biden “resident not president” and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her “Tore Says” podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican, joining the court’s three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras’ roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose’s office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official – acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter – filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official’s favor, and LaRose’s office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWynnewood: Joe Exotic is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune “I Saw a Tiger” in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further “unauthorized use” of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. “I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,” he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. “It’s super hard on families,” said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddletown: A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team’s season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. “This investigation did not involve just hazing or ‘boys will be boys’ conduct,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. “Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing.” Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed “a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment” to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts “completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, was “a strong leader” who was especially good to the city’s senior citizens, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. “She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,” Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard’s residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn’t seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for “a couple of weeks,” police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. “She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history,” Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city’s first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel’s Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn’t guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel’s Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel’s Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor’s office did not follow the state’s open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor’s safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota’s Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem’s labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren’s retirement in the weeks after Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure – a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday. Chelsea Clinton, the foundation’s vice chair, made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative’s two-day meeting of international dignitaries in New York. The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year’s gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving “humanity’s most pressing problems,” ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. “Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,” Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states. Previous hosts include the University of Chicago, Howard University, and member schools of the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Alarmed parents converged on a high school Tuesday after a classroom shooting report that ultimately proved to be false. The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. “Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,” said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. “We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened.” Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother’s 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still “haunt him and his family,” said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron’s family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family’s lawsuit even longer, he said. “There are mixed emotions by the family,” Morris said. “It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues.” After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mandatory testing for lead in drinking water – and repairs to keep that water safe – has been completed at 98% of the state’s schools and child care centers, the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2019 requiring schools and child care facilities to test their drinking and cooking water for lead, a highly toxic metal. Roughly 1 in 5 taps had elevated lead levels out of the more than 15,000 taps tested between June 2019 and December 2021. Lead exposure can slow children’s growth, impair development and learning, and cause behavioral problems. Lead was more frequently found in water fixtures, rather than plumbing, which made fixes both easier and less expensive. The state provided funding to reimburse schools and child care centers for remediation costs, 90% of which cost less than $500. “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect and promote the health and safety of children in early care and education programs,” said Commissioner Sean Brown of the Agency of Human Services’ Child Development Division. “Collaborative efforts like this help ensure that children in Vermont have positive, safe learning environments in which they can grow and develop.”\n\nVirginia\n\nMartinsville: A marker has been dedicated in front of the old Henry County Courthouse recognizing the Martinsville Seven, a group of Black men executed in 1951 over an alleged rape. “Here in 1949, six all-white, all-male juries convicted seven Black men of the rape of a white woman. All seven men were sentenced to death. On appeal, NAACP attorneys submitted the first petition to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that capital punishment had been disproportionately applied against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment. Despite international attention and petitions for clemency, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed the men in Feb. 1951, the most executions for a rape in U.S. history,” the marker says. The old Henry County Courthouse is now the Martinsville-Henry County Heritage Center and Museum, inside which a display recounts the day in 1949 when Ruby Floyd told police she had been raped. Francis Grayson, Frank Hairston Jr., Howard Hairston, James Hairston, Joe Hampton, Booker Millner and John Taylor were arrested and confessed. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the confessions were coerced, but all seven men were found guilty and sentenced to death. The NAACP failed in its appeal, and over just four days, the seven were put to death by the electric chair in Richmond.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Next year voters will decide whether the city should set up a public developer to create affordable housing. The Seattle Times reports the City Council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to allow King County Elections to put the proposed Initiative 135 on the ballot of a special election to be held Feb. 14, 2023. If I-135 passes, it would create a public development authority, called the Seattle Social Housing Developer, to construct homes and take over existing properties using government and philanthropic funding to create renter-governed housing. Those who favor the initiative say housing would be protected from rental market forces in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Walmart and CVS Pharmacy have settled with the state of West Virginia for a combined total of $147 million in a lawsuit over the companies’ roles in contributing to the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the opioid epidemic in the country’s most impacted state, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday. Walmart and CVS were two lawsuits that were part of a larger trial that was pushed back to June of next year along with Kroger and Walgreens. Morrisey recently announced a settlement with Rite Aid for up to $30 million to resolve similar litigation. The lawsuits allege the pharmacies’ contributions to the oversupply of prescription opioids in the state have caused “significant losses through their past and ongoing medical treatment costs, including for minors born addicted to opioids, rehabilitation costs, naloxone costs, medical examiner expenses, self-funded state insurance costs and other forms of losses to address opioid-related afflictions and loss of lives.” It brings the total settlements by the state in opioid lawsuits to $875 million, including $296 million with manufacturers, $400 million with wholesalers and $177.5 million involving pharmacies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has called on Gov. Tony Evers to halt all paroles in the state, even though a governor can’t unilaterally order them to stop, and some paroles are mandated by law. Michels has been hitting Evers as being soft on crime, accusing the Democrat in a letter Monday of sympathizing with and coddling “brutal, convicted criminals.” Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said it would be illegal to do as Michels wants and called the request “an uninformed stunt to score political points by someone who has no regard or appreciation for the laws of our state.” Michels and Evers are knotted in a tight contest in the battleground state that polls show is about even. Michaels, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump and is the co-owner of the state’s largest construction company, has been attacking Evers over his parole policies and his response to violent protests in Kenosha two years ago that followed the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by a white police officer. Wisconsin’s parole commission, which operates independently of the governor, has granted about 460 discretionary paroles not required by law, something that both Republican and Democratic governors before Evers also routinely granted.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Rockslides have seemingly been ramping up in the Tetons, mountain guides say, and scientists are pointing to climate change as a likely culprit, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The anecdotal increase in rockfall in the mountain range comes as warmer temperatures take their toll on glaciers, which long covered the Tetons. Simeon Caskey, head of the physical science branch at Grand Teton National Park, told the newspaper that so-called weathering is behind much of the rockfall, with shifting water and ice leading to changes in the geologic structure of the area. “We’ve seen from some studies in the Alps that rockfall is happening more frequently at higher elevations as a result of climate change and increased temperatures and increased extreme rainfall events,” he said, calling that European mountain range an “appropriate analogue for what’s happening in the Tetons.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/06/bag-full-drugs-kiwiberries-retiring-bulldog-news-around-states/41148029/", "title": "'Bag Full of Drugs,' kiwiberries: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey said Tuesday that the state must reinvent its corrections system as it grapples with a prison crisis and also called for borrowing $1 billion to fund improvements at public schools. The Republican governor detailed a wide-ranging agenda in her annual State of the State address, given on the opening night of the legislative session. Ivey said she is creating a group to study a lottery or casinos as a revenue source for the state, a move that could press the pause button on anticipated gambling debate in the Legislature. Prisons are expected to be a central focus on the legislative session after the U.S. Justice Department last year said violent and crowded conditions in Alabama prisons violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Ivey’s administration is exploring a plan to lease three new prisons and close most existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State highway officials are looking for mechanics and using department assets to find them. Electronic message boards set up along roads around Anchorage are displaying help-wanted messages calling for heavy-duty mechanics to apply to the state Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, KTVA-television reports. The department has three heavy-duty mechanic positions open in Anchorage, says spokesperson Shannon McCarthy, and maintenance shops in Fairbanks, Valdez and Healy also have vacancies. McCarthy says it’s sometimes tough to attract and retain mechanics who can maintain construction equipment. The electronic signs urge potential applicants to call the department for more information.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal judge in Tucson has reversed the misdemeanor convictions of four activists, saying members of the humanitarian group No More Deaths were led by “sincere religious beliefs” when placing water and food for migrants in Arizona’s protected Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge near the U.S.-Mexico border. Judge Rosemary Marquez wrote in the opinion filed Monday that Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick met the guidelines for establishing they acted on their beliefs. The four had appealed another judge’s ruling a year ago finding them guilty of federal misdemeanors. They were cited by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services officers in 2017 after driving a truck into the wilderness area and leaving bottles of water and other supplies for migrants who cross the region.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: Benton County plans to appeal the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s decision not to help pay for the costs to clean up damages from two tornadoes that struck in October, officials said. The county was notified of the decision by letter Jan. 24, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The county has 30 days to appeal. The letter did not specify why the county was denied. But Robert McGowen, county public safety administrator, said it was because the county was short $124,134 of the threshold for assistance. Damage assessments from the October tornadoes totaled $6.5 million for uninsured public property, McGowen said. Most of the damage – $5.5 million worth – involved two electric companies. “For some reason, FEMA did not accept the preliminary damage assessment numbers we provided them and reduced the amounts that were submitted by the entities,” McGowen said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The governor revealed a plan Tuesday that would keep more water in the fragile San Joaquin River Delta while restoring 60,000 acres of habitat for endangered species and generating more than $5 billion in new funding for environmental improvements. The framework announced Tuesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom is a unique approach to managing the state’s scarce water resources. Historically, California has governed water usage by issuing rules – often challenged in court by farmers or environmental groups. Those lawsuits can drag on for years and prevent programs designed to boost sagging salmon populations and other threatened species that live in the delta. Instead of issuing new rules, for the past year the Newsom administration has been negotiating with water agencies to come up with “voluntary agreements” between the two sides with “partnership and oversight from environmental groups.”\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: A school district hired a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent to conduct an investigation into a high school’s culture related to student claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The Steamboat Springs School District hired Jane Quimby of Quimby and Associates in Grand Junction to investigate complaints that female students were not being heard or protected by administrators, The Steamboat Pilot & Today reports. District officials also announced Steamboat Springs High School Principal Kevin Taulman has been placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation. Quimby served as an FBI special agent for 20 years and is an attorney and a former high school and college teacher, officials said. Quimby will report to the school district’s attorneys, Caplan & Earnest, and not to Superintendent Brad Meeks in order to strengthen the integrity of the investigation, officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal judge has dismissed nearly all claims in a lawsuit that sought to force all-male fraternities at Yale University to admit women, saying fraternities and sororities are specifically excluded from a federal law that bans discrimination based on gender in education. U.S. District Judge Victor Bolden in Bridgeport issued the ruling Jan. 30 in the lawsuit filed last year by three women who attend Yale. They sued nine fraternities and Yale in response to alleged sexual assault, harassment and discrimination at the all-male social organizations. The judge allowed only one claim against Yale to continue forward toward trial: an allegation that school officials failed to act when informed by one of the plaintiffs that she and other women had been groped against their will at a fraternity party in 2016.\n\nDelaware\n\nBridgeville: A year after moving the World Championship Punkin Chunkin from Delaware to Illinois, event organizers have made a plea to their fans here: “Bring us home.” “The biggest thing is to create the buzz. It’s a great tradition to try to keep continuing,” says Frank Payton, president of the World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association. While organizers said Illinois had better state protections against liability – a special focus after a 2016 malfunction left a person critically injured – it drew a much smaller crowd than back home. Payton estimates fewer than 15,000 people attended last year’s event in Rantoul, Illinois, over two days, down from the estimated 30,000 in 2016. At its height, the nonprofit Punkin Chunkin drew up to 100,000 wide-eyed spectators to Sussex County, raising more than $1 million through the years for local charities. Last year it managed to pull in just $1,500.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A thief caught on surveillance video stole a mother’s vehicle while she was pumping gas and her child was sitting in the back seat. The mother was dragged Tuesday morning while trying to stop the thief, news outlets report. Video appeared to a show a man sneak into the SUV and drive away as the mother tried to stop the thief. Elroy Jacobs told news outlets he witnessed the woman being dragged for about a block before she was run over. He said he chased the vehicle and found the child still inside after the SUV was abandoned. “I saw this woman hollering, ‘My baby, my baby, they’re taking my baby,’ ” Jacobs said. “I’m not thinking about no weapon, if they have any weapon. I’m just thinking about the child.” It’s unclear whether the mother was injured. Police had not announced any suspects or arrests, news outlets report.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two men charged with drug trafficking could have done a better job hiding their wares than using a package labeled “Bag Full of Drugs,” authorities say. Ian Simmons and Joshua Reinhardt, both 34, were pulled over Saturday after a trooper clocked them going 95 mph on Interstate 10 in the Panhandle, according to a Florida Highway Patrol arrest report. The trooper determined Reinhardt was the subject of a felony warrant for violation of probation and requested backup. A Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s deputy arrived, and a K-9 alerted them to the presence of contraband in the vehicle, the report said. Authorities found about 75 grams of methamphetamine, 1.36 kilograms of the date-rape drug GHB, 1 gram of cocaine, 3.6 grams of fentanyl, 15 MDMA tablets and drug paraphernalia. “Note to self- do not traffic your illegal narcotics in bags labeled ‘Bag Full Of Drugs,’ ” deputies wrote on Facebook. “Our K-9’s can read.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp and state Superintendent Richard Woods announced a plan Tuesday to cut five mandatory standardized tests for public school students, including four in high school. The Republican officials are also trying to cut the length of state tests and evaluate local tests that Georgia’s 181 school districts give to evaluate student progress. Both Woods and Kemp oppose the current amount of testing, part of a national backlash to a system largely built by Republicans in Georgia. “When you look at the big picture, it’s clear Georgia simply tests too much,” Kemp said at a news conference. “On test days it’s making students physically sick because they’re worried they will not do well.” The biggest changes would come in high school. The economics test would be dropped, and the state Board of Education would decide which others would go – possibly geometry, physical science and American literature.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A sick Hawaiian monk seal under the care of wildlife scientists is suffering from a parasitic infection often spread via feral cat feces, officials say. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials determined the seal was suffering from toxoplasmosis, The Honolulu Star-Tribune reports. The female seal, known as Pohaku, was taken from Ko Olina on Oahu to the agency for monitoring after reports she was “logging,” or lethargically floating on the water. There are an estimated 50,000 to 300,000 feral cats on Oahu, and they are a primary source of toxoplasmosis, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats, the agency says on its website. Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to the parasitic eggs when they consume contaminated prey or water, the NOAA says. Toxoplasmosis can destroy muscle, liver, heart and brain tissue and cause organ failure. Treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.\n\nIdaho\n\nBonners Ferry: A long-closed road built through grizzly bear habitat in northern Idaho will reopen following national security concerns, federal agencies said. The U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the plan to reopen more than 5 miles of Bog Creek Road after years of discussion, The Spokesman-Review reports. The road was closed in the late 1980s to protect endangered grizzly bears roaming the area between Upper Priest Lake in Idaho and the Canadian border, officials said. The U.S. Border Patrol has asked the Forest Service since 2013 to reopen the road because of threats to border security. Neither agency specified those threats. The Forest Service is expected to install and repair culverts along the road and to cut back trees and other vegetation that has come close to or obstructed the road, officials said. The road will “not be open for public motorized use,” Forest Service officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: Police are searching for a man who caused thousands of dollars of damage in a Walmart in suburban Chicago by spraying disinfectant inside the store while wearing a surgical mask and a sign on his back declaring that he has the deadly coronavirus. Two men apparently in their 20s walked into the store in Joliet on Sunday. One of them put on the yellow surgical mask and started spraying Lysol on clothing, produce and health and beauty items, causing nearly $10,000 in damage, police said. “He was telling everyone the same thing, that he was protecting them from the virus,” Tony Prokes, a customer, told WLS-TV in Chicago. The man wore a homemade sign on his back that read, “Caution I have the Coronavirus.” The apparent prank comes amid growing worldwide concern about the virus that has killed hundreds of people, most of them in mainland China, and sickened more than 20,000 around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: A local man testified that a now-dead man gave him a video recording of his confession to killing five people in 2000, a crime for which another man is serving 300 years in prison. Cleveland C. Bynum, 37, was convicted of murder in 2001 for the shooting deaths of sisters Angela Wallace, 24, and Suzanne Wallace, 34, who were both from Gary. Bynum, then 22, was also convicted of killing 37-year-old Sheila R. Bartee and 24-year-old Anthony Jeffers, also from Gary, and Elizabeth Daily-Ayers, 37, of Hobart. Bynum’s attorney, Frances Watson, filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief in 2016 for Bynum, who maintains his innocence and is seeking to overturn his conviction. Lake Criminal Magistrate Natalie Bokota on Monday heard testimony for the relief, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Roger Shannon testified Gerald Mathews gave him a cellphone that contained a video recording of Mathews confessing to killing the five people.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Griff the bulldog, Drake University’s live mascot, will retire this summer, the university announced Wednesday. Drake anointed the former champion show dog as its live mascot in fall 2015. Now 7, Griff has since been a constant staple at thousands of Drake events, the Drake Relays and other sporting events, and graduations. Over the past year, he tried to meet as many presidential candidates as he could in the run-up to the 2020 Iowa caucuses. “Griff has been such a special part of our campus community,” Drake President Marty Martin said in a statement. Drake anticipates having Griff’s successor, Griff II, in place by July 1, the day after Griff is set to retire. Future live mascots will be christened Griff with an additional nickname. The school said Griff intends to enjoy long naps in retirement, mostly on his favorite oversized chair.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A collaborative effort is underway to preserve and make accessible historic television and radio programs produced by public media stations in the state. KMUW-FM and the American Archive of Public Broadcasting said in a news release Wednesday that the online collection will be digitized from deteriorating and obsolete formats. It will showcase statewide coverage of social issues, commentary, public reporting and history from more than 70 years of archival collections in the state. The Kansas collection consists of programs produced by KMUW, High Plains Public Radio, KPR, KPTS, KRPS, KHCC and Vietnamese Public Radio. These programs will be the first from Kansas contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, a collaboration between the Library of Congress and Boston public media producer WGBH.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The town where President Abraham Lincoln was born will host activities this month to commemorate his 211th birthday. Ceremonies will be held Feb. 12 in downtown Hodgenville and at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park, officials say. Local officials plan to attend the first ceremony, which will include a flag raising and wreath laying, according to the statement from Lincoln Days Celebration. The event at the national park will include a procession from the visitor center to the Memorial Building and a wreath laying. Afterward, a luncheon at the LaRue County Extension Building will feature Centre College President John Roush, who will speak about Lincoln’s leadership style and legacy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A group that was denied permission to march in the city of Natchitoches’ Christmas parade when it insisted on carrying Confederate battle flags asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to revive its lawsuit alleging constitutional violations. The permit for the Louisiana Sons of Confederate Veterans was denied in late 2015, months after the slayings of nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church by white supremacist Dylann Roof. Pictures on social media of Roof posing with Confederate battle flags led to renewed opposition to public displays of Confederate iconography around the nation. In Natchitoches, a nonprofit group that organized the annual parade denied a permit to the SCV after city officials expressed concerns that some in the city would be offended by the display of Confederate battle flags and that protests might disrupt the procession.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s two U.S. senators are among a group of lawmakers pushing for the federal government to crack down on the use of dairy terms on plant-based products. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King want U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn to work with Congress to prevent what they see as misuse of dairy terms on products that contain no dairy. Collins and King joined a bipartisan group of seven senators in asking for Hahn’s help in late January. The senators said the use of dairy terms such as “milk” on “imitation products in the marketplace” is confusing for consumers. The International Food Information Council Foundation released survey results in 2018 saying that “three-quarters of Americans understand that plant-based ‘milk’ products do not actually contain cow’s milk.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik won special primaries Tuesday for the U.S. congressional seat that was held by the late Elijah Cummings. In a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 4 to 1, the Democratic nominee will be the heavy favorite heading into the April 28 special general election. The majority-black district includes parts of Baltimore’s inner city that have struggled with drugs and violent crime, as well as more well-to-do communities in the suburbs. Whoever wins the special general election will serve the rest of Cummings’ term through Jan. 3, 2021, and have to stand for reelection in November to keep the seat. For Mfume, who in 1996 stepped down to lead the NAACP after serving five terms as a district’s congressman, it’s a chance to regain the seat he held more than 20 years ago.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Commuters can expect several years of station gridlock at one of the city’s busiest train stations once major construction kicks off in late summer. Boston transportation officials have warned commuters who use South Station that they should add 5 to 10 minutes to their daily commute in anticipation of delays caused by the construction of an office tower and installation of fare gates. The number of doors that commuters use to get from the lobby to the platforms and back will be limited to five, down from the typical eight to 10, and a large area of the concourse will be cordoned off. The new configuration could come as early as July, The Boston Globe reports. A concrete extension will be added to the platform to allow more room for riders under the new construction configuration. New fare gates will also be installed on the outside area near the platforms.\n\nMichigan\n\nSaline: A public meeting called to address racist social media posts by students at a suburban Detroit high school turned volatile when a white parent asked a Hispanic parent, “Why didn’t you stay in Mexico?” The exchange Monday shocked many who had gathered for a community meeting at the Saline Area Schools district office. Parent Adrian Iraola said his son had endured racist name-calling by students in the district and described the impact it had on him, ultimately fueling him to earn a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University. As Iraola described “the abuse that he was enduring in this school system,” another parent, Tom Burtell, interjected, “Then why didn’t you stay in Mexico?” Iraola responded that he lives in America because it is “the greatest country in the world.” In an MLive.com interview, Matthew Burtell, a 2014 Saline High School alumnus and Tom Burtell’s son, spoke out against his father’s “racist and xenophobic behavior.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: There’s time to protect the privacy of Minnesotans who vote in the Super Tuesday presidential primary March 3, Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon and a bipartisan group of lawmakers said Wednesday. Under current law, the state must provide the names and party preference of primary voters to the four parties with major-party status in Minnesota – Democrats, Republicans and two pro-cannabis parties. A bill rolled out Wednesday by Democratic Sen. Ann Rest, of New Hope, and Democratic Rep. Ray Dehn, of Minneapolis, would tightly restrict that data. The bill, which has some Republican support, would restrict the sharing of party preference data to the national party committees, and only for verification purposes. Otherwise the data would be private, with penalties for making it public. And voters could opt out of sharing their data.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A plan to give teachers at least a $1,000 pay raise won state Senate approval Wednesday, and now it goes to the House. The pay bill easily passed the Senate with bipartisan support. Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said last week that he wants it to be part of a multiyear plan to increase some of the lowest salaries in the nation. Senate Bill 2001 would give $1,000 across-the-board raises to most teachers and to all teachers’ assistants. Teachers in the first two years of their careers would receive raises of $1,100 in an effort to boost the beginning salaries. The National Education Association says the average teacher salary in the U.S. was $60,477 for the 2017-18 school year. Mississippi had the lowest average that year, at $44,926. The average teacher salary in Mississippi for the 2018-19 school year – the most recent data available – was $45,105, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers on Tuesday voted to make grants available for potential builders of an ultrafast Hyperloop test track in the state. House members in a voice vote gave initial approval to a bill that would make a 10- to 15-mile test track eligible for public-private partnership grants. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds up to 640 mph. Missouri supporters envision connecting Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis with a system that could cut a roughly 4-hour drive across the state down to a 30-minute commute. They’re now advocating for a test track to be built in Missouri. “It would bring in investment dollars from around the world to make Missouri an innovative state,” bill sponsor Rep. Travis Fitzwater told colleagues on the House floor. It’s not cheap. Some estimates have put the cost at $25 million to $27 million per mile, excluding land acquisition.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced it is removing a portion of a former wood-treatment facility in the state from its list of Superfund sites, despite concerns. The agency and the state Department of Environmental Quality determined that all the required cleanup of the facility is complete and that no additional work is needed to protect human health and the environment in the area, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The Idaho Pole Company operated the facility near Cedar Street until 1997 and contributed to soil and groundwater contamination, officials said. It was designated a Superfund site in 1986. The Gallatin City-County Board of Health and the Gallatin Local Water Quality District have repeatedly voiced concerns and have said the federal agency did not adequately work with local government officials to ensure redevelopment is safe.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: American evacuees from the growing coronavirus outbreak in China will be flying into Omaha as soon as Thursday and be quarantined at a nearby Nebraska National Guard training base, officials said Wednesday. The plane will be landing at Eppley Airfield and park at a remote spot. The passengers will not go inside the terminal, said a news release from Nebraska Medicine, and they’ll be taken to Camp Ashland, which sits about 30 miles southwest of the airport. Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said he couldn’t yet say how many evacuees were headed to Omaha or when the flight was expected to land. Nebraska National Guard officials have been preparing to house evacuees in three buildings with 85 hotel-style rooms at the camp. Guard officials have said the evacuees won’t interact with guardsmen or employees there.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The entry point to about 13,000 acres of scenic backcountry in the Lake Tahoe Basin will get an upgrade. The Tahoe Fund announced this week that it landed a $100,000 donation from the E.L. Cord Foundation among other gifts to jump-start the work in the Spooner Lake area of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. The fund raised $300,000 through private donations for an amphitheater that is part of the project. But the fundraising is more important than the amount suggests because the money from private sources will be used to leverage $2.9 million in public funds, Tahoe Fund CEO Amy Berry said. The project by the Nevada Division of State Parks could break ground as soon as spring 2020, with phase one complete by the end of 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire expert on kiwiberries will give a crop overview and discuss best production practices and information on market potential on the grape-sized fruit in an event this weekend. The Kiwiberry Breeding and Research Development program is the first of its kind in the nation. Will Hastings, vineyard manager and research technician of the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station’s program, will give a discussion Saturday at the NOFA-NH Winter Conference at Kearsarge Regional High School in North Sutton. The tropical-tasting, smooth-skinned relative of the fuzzy supermarket kiwi has been grown in backyards and private gardens in the region for more than 140 years. Despite its long history, though, virtually no commercial production exists. Hastings is co-author of “Growing Kiwiberries in New England, a Guide for Regional Producers.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has restored funding to one of two public assistance programs that help Ocean County senior citizens maintain their independence, Freeholder Director Joseph H. Vicari says. The county government is to receive $1.47 million for the Jersey Assistance for Community Caregiving program, up about $400,000 for the state fiscal year 2020, Vicari says. The program, which will serve about 225 seniors each month, offers an array of services for those who would otherwise be forced to reside in nursing homes. Those services include respite care, housekeeping, home delivered meals, personal emergency response plans, transportation, adult day care, special medical equipment or supplies, caregiver training and home health aide services. Applicants must meet certain income requirements, all according to county officials.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state House of Representatives approved a budget plan Wednesday to increase annual state spending by more than a half-billion dollars to expand early childhood education programs, boost teacher salaries and shore up health care for the poor. The House voted 46-24 along party lines with Democrats in support of the $7.6 billion general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The bill now moves to the Senate, where a variety of amendments are likely. State economists are forecasting an $800 million surplus in state government income for the coming fiscal year that is linked closely to record-setting oil production in the state. Republicans in the House minority criticized the proposed $530 million, 7.5% increase as irresponsible and unsustainable in the event of an oil-sector downturn. They outlined their own plan that would increase spending by 4.3% and called for giving every New Mexico resident a $200 rebate.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could ban retail pet shops from selling dogs, cats or rabbits as soon as mid-2021 under a Democratic state senator’s bill. The state would join Maryland and California and hundreds of municipalities nationwide that have taken a stand to outlaw sales of those pets, Deputy Senate Leader Mike Gianaris said Monday. Supporters including The Humane Society of the United States and the New York State Animal Protection Federation say the vast majority of New York pet stores already don’t sell cats, dogs or rabbits. But Libby Post, the executive director of the federation, says the proposal is an “opportunity for pet stores to rebrand themselves as compassionate businesses that put puppies over profits.” New Yorkers could still buy cats, dogs and rabbits directly from breeders.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Officials in the capital city approved the creation of a citizen advisory board Tuesday charged with reviewing the police department’s policies. Activists have called for greater oversight of the Raleigh Police Department’s procedures for years, despite pushback from some department employees and leaders, news outlets report. The calls were renewed following the fatal shooting of a man Raleigh police said was armed and “acting strangely” last week, as well as a traffic stop last month that prompted a use-of-force investigation, the outlets say. The board will consist of five members, but those people have not been announced, according to Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin. She asked for people interested in serving on the board to reach out to their council member.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group is seeking to oust Burleigh County Commissioner Kathleen Jones through a recall petition due in part to her support for resettling refugees in the county. The petition against her, which lists a five-person sponsoring committee, calls for Jones to be recalled for “the reasons of contempt of the voters and negligence in office.” The county commission voted 3-2 in December to allow Lutheran Social Services to continue resettling refugees in Burleigh County. The meeting was prompted by an executive order from President Donald Trump that left the question up to states and counties. In January, the commission voted 3-2 not to put the question of future refugee resettlement before voters in the form of a nonbinding straw poll. State law limits recall petitions to one official. Recall organizer Robert Field said Jones “was the easiest target.” Jones, who has served since 2014, believes she is being targeted because of her gender.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame is seeking nominations to honor people who have continued to contribute to their communities after their military service. Nominees must be current or past Ohio residents who have been outstanding in volunteerism, advocacy, professional distinction, public service or philanthropy. Each year, the Hall of Fame inducts up to 20 former members of the U.S. Armed Forces based on recommendations from a statewide executive committee of veterans and approval by the governor. Nearly 900 veterans have been inducted since the hall’s 1992 inception. They include astronaut Neil Armstrong, actor Paul Newman and fast-food entrepreneur Dave Thomas. The state Department of Veterans Services encourages people to submit nominations before a deadline of June 1, 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city will conduct a test excavation at an area cemetery as part of an ongoing effort to find remains of victims of a 1921 race massacre, officials say. The test excavation at Oaklawn Cemetery, planned for April, was announced during the city’s Mass Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee meeting Monday, the Tulsa World reports. The meeting came a little more than a month after investigators announced that geophysical surveys conducted in October had found anomalies consistent with possible graves. “We would see this as an intermediate step,” says Kary Stackelbeck, a state archaeologist. The massacre happened over the course of 16 hours, from May 31 to June 1, 1921, when mobs of white residents attacked black residents and businesses. As many as 300 people were killed, hundreds more injured and thousands left homeless. Tulsa’s prosperous black business district known as Black Wall Street was destroyed.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state senator told demonstrators opposed to a plan to build a natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal in Oregon that he expects the battle to go to the courts if the Trump administration tries to ram the project through despite a lack of state permits. Gov. Kate Brown’s office said late Tuesday that she “would consider all available options” if the federal government tried to preempt state permitting processes. Demonstrators gathered outside the Department of State Lands on Tuesday to thank its director, Vicki Walker, for refusing to grant another extension to Pembina, an energy company based in Calgary, Canada, for a decision on a removal-fill permit. The permit is required to dredge sediment out of Coos Bay, on Oregon’s southern coast, for the marine export terminal and to construct a 230-mile feeder pipeline through and under waterways in southern Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A bill that would provide millions in tax breaks for new construction of facilities to use natural gas extracted in the state to make fertilizers and other chemicals will be vetoed by the governor, his spokesman said Wednesday. The bill, which passed both legislative chambers this week by veto-proof majorities, authorizes the “energy and fertilizer manufacturing tax credit” for projects that require at least $450 million in construction and startup costs and create at least 800 jobs. The Revenue Department estimates the tax credit would be worth about $22 million annually, per plant. The tax break would expire at the end of 2050. Wolf “believes such projects should be evaluated on a specific case-by-case basis,” said his press secretary, J.J. Abbott. “However, if there was a specific project, he would be open to a conversation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Inspectors found no evidence of black mold days after a General Assembly office was evacuated. The Joint Committee on Legislative Services offices were cleared after an employee reported finding mold under her desk, and aides to House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said last week that renovations began as a result. The work, which included the removal of filing cabinets, raised concerns because it coincided with a lawsuit involving the committee and a state police investigation. When the committee revealed that no official test had been done to check for black mold before the work began, state officials ordered one. The report, which was released Monday, found no black mold. The report did find a “moderate” level of mold spores in air samples from the office, but the technician who conducted the test told WPRI-TV it did not indicate a cause for concern.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Several downtown streets were closed Wednesday after construction crews found a Civil War artillery shell, police said. The crew called 911 about 10 a.m. to report the shell in downtown Charleston, just over a block from the Old Slave Mart where dozens of vendors sell merchandise, Charleston police said. The police department called the U.S. Air Force to dispose of the shell and closed several nearby roads for about three hours as a precaution. Investigators initially said the shell appeared to be newer than the Civil War, but after further investigation, they concluded it was left over from the war between the Union and the Confederacy between 1861 and 1865, police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. No injuries were reported.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Small towns in the state say they are strapped for cash after historically bad flooding last year and are asking the Legislature to let them use money from gas taxes for road repairs. A bill from Sen. Brock Greenfield, R-Clark, would use money from the state’s motor fuel tax and the Department of Transportation to create a $2.4 million fund that townships could tap for road repairs. But cities, counties, the Department of Transportation and other programs argue that it would take money away from repairs they need to make. The Senate Local Government Committee passed the bill on a 4-3 vote Wednesday. The bill would designate the funds for repairing culverts and small structures like bridges. Lawmakers said they want the full Senate to consider the proposal, hoping it would spark further discussion on how to help towns fund road repairs.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A Republican-led legislative panel has decided not to decide, for now, whether it thinks a bust of a former Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader should be removed from the Capitol. The House committee on Naming, Designating, & Private Acts voted Tuesday to delay consideration of the nonbinding resolution that favors removing the statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest until the panel’s last meeting, likely months away. Republicans said the delay allows Tennessee’s Capitol Commission to weigh in first. The commission meets Feb. 20 and will allow public testimony on the bust, but officials don’t plan to hold a vote at that meeting. Removing the bust would require approval from the Capitol Commission and then the state’s Historical Commission, as laid out by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An appeals court heard arguments Tuesday in the case of a mother who does not want a hospital to end life-sustaining treatment for her 1-year-old daughter. Texas’ Second Court Court of Appeals in Fort Worth is considering the case after a lower court said Cook Children’s Medical Center could remove Tinslee Lewis from life support. The appeals court has said the child will remain on life support until it makes a final ruling in the case. Doctors at the Fort Worth hospital have said Tinslee is in pain and will never recover. Her 20-year-old mother, Trinity Lewis, has said she doesn’t think Tinslee, who turned 1 on Saturday, is suffering. Lewis’ attorney, Joe Nixon, told the three appellate judges that Lewis has the right to decide whether her daughter lives or dies. Amy Warr, an attorney for Cook Children’s, said doctors have a right to decline care for a patient if that care “causes suffering without medical benefit.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A resolution encouraging consideration of later high school start times has earned unanimous support from a state legislative committee. The nonbinding resolution was presented to the House Health and Human Services Committee by Democratic Rep. Suzanne Harrison, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The resolution will proceed to the full House for a vote. Harrison, a physician, offered research at the hearing showing the circadian rhythms that regulate the waking and sleeping cycles of teenagers are different from those of children and adults. While adults typically begin winding down about 9 p.m., the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is released about two hours later in teenagers, which is why their most productive sleep period is between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m., Harrison testified.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Democratic-led state House failed by one vote Wednesday to override a veto by Republican Gov. Phil Scott of a bill that would have established a paid family leave system in the state. The vote of 99 in favor of overriding the governor to 51 against came less than a week after Scott vetoed the bill because the plan included a $29 million payroll tax. Scott prefers a voluntary program. The bill would have guaranteed up to 12 weeks of paid parental or bonding leave and up to eight weeks of paid family care leave. Proponents have said the bill was needed to help recruit and retain workers in Vermont. When the bill passed the House last week, it was 11 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the governor’s veto. But some of those who voted “no” before changed their votes Wednesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The capital city recorded a 10% increase in its homeless population during a winter survey, according to preliminary data from the count. The number of people sleeping in shelters or outside grew from 497 people in January 2019 to 549 last month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing a regional survey conducted biannually. It’s the first such increase since 2011, the newspaper says. “The focus on serving households with more complex needs and higher barriers to housing is the primary driver of this increase,” Kelly King Horne, a director of the region’s homeless services, told the newspaper. Still, the numbers are a little under half of what was recorded a decade ago, when 1,150 people were counted as homeless, according to data from 2009.\n\nWashington\n\nSeaTac: The city will no longer issue exorbitant bills for free-speech demonstrations. An immigrant rights group called Families Belong Together-Washington Coalition sued SeaTac in 2018 after the city sent it a $37,000 bill for public safety costs related to a protest of President Donald Trump’s separation of migrant families along the U.S.-Mexico border. The official who issued the bill said the city code required him to charge Families Belong Together for the actual costs of the event, which drew about 10,000 people June 30, 2018. Dozens of mothers who had been separated from their children were detained at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac at the time. But organizers said such a policy unlawfully chilled free speech rights under the U.S. and Washington Constitutions. The new policy says the city will not charge more than $500 for public safety costs and will waive the fees entirely if organizers demonstrate they are not able to pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A resolution to prohibit the state’s court system from interfering in ongoing legislative action failed in the state Senate on Wednesday, the latest unsuccessful attempt to address a 2018 ruling that halted impeachment proceedings against several Supreme Court justices. The vote in the Senate was 20-13, but the resolution did not receive the required two-thirds support for passage. If it had passed both houses, the resolution would have gone before voters. Last October the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a decision by five acting state Supreme Court justices that prosecuting then-Chief Justice Margaret Workman in the state Senate would violate the state constitution’s separation of powers clause. That ruling was later applied to also halt impeachment proceedings against two other sitting justices who have since left the court: Robin Davis and Allen Loughry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul and advocates for victims of sexual assault made a last-ditch effort Wednesday to save a pair of bipartisan bills intended to prevent a backlog of untested rape evidence kits, blasting Republicans’ divisive substitute proposal as a partisan attempt to ensure nothing becomes law this session. The Republican-backed bill adopts the same kit submission and tracking protocols laid out in the original bills but contains provisions requiring police notify immigration officials if attackers are in the country illegally and allowing students assaulted by other students or teachers to enter the state’s school choice programs. Both proposals are nonstarters with Democrats. Gov. Tony Evers would almost certainly veto the legislation if it reaches him. “This bill is a mess,” Kaul told Republicans on the Assembly Health Committee during a hearing on the measure.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Project leaders are seeking names to include in a new memorial honoring military veterans from within the Wind River Indian Reservation. All military veterans who have lived within the boundaries of the Wyoming reservation could have their names included, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. That includes veterans from Riverton, a city of about 11,000 people that is encircled by the reservation but is not part of it. The “Path of Honor” memorial will be located outside the Frank B. Wise Business Center building in Fort Washakie and include a garden walkway and four massive stones listing the names of the veterans, organizers said. The four stones will form the shape of a buffalo, organizer and Eastern Shoshone Vietnam War veteran Scott Ratliff said. Organizers hope to complete the memorial sculpture garden by the summer. The deadline for submitting veterans’ names is Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/06"}]}
{"question_id": "20250207_1", "search_time": "2025/02/07/23:02", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/04/25/h5n1-avian-bird-flu-milk-humans-cows/73438251007/", "title": "H5N1 avian flu spreads from birds to cows, US milk, humans", "text": "Avian influenza has raged through Michigan's bird population for two years, forcing commercial farmers and people with backyard coops to kill nearly 6.8 million infected chickens and turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl in about two dozen counties across the state — all with the hope of slowing the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.\n\nBut so far, culling infected flocks hasn't been enough to curtail the assault from the virus, which was identified Wednesday in another Michigan commercial poultry facility, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. This time, it's in Gratiot County. An MDARD spokesperson told the Free Press that a state law, Public Act 466, prohibits the agency from releasing any details that would identify the commercial poultry facility where the outbreak occurred.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture all have said the risk to most Americans is low — even though the FDA reported Thursday that 1 in 5 samples of pasteurized milk sold in U.S. grocery stores contain what are believed to be neutralized H5N1 viral particles.\n\nWhat's most concerning to public health experts is that it isn't only birds that have been infected by the H5N1 virus. It's spreading in cows — eight U.S. states, including Michigan, have known bovine cases — and the virus has been detected in other mammals, too, such as seals and foxes, raccoons and skunks. In two cases in other states, people have gotten sick.\n\n\"To date, this strain of avian influenza has not been associated with significant disease in humans,\" said Dr. Kim Dodd, director of the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThe virus doesn't appear to spread easily from animals to people. That's because the strain circulating now in the U.S. does not bind easily enough to the receptors in the human upper respiratory tract to cause widespread infections in people, the CDC said in a report updated Friday.\n\n\"However, because of the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the wide global prevalence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza A) H5N1 viruses in wild birds and poultry outbreaks and following the identification and spread among dairy cattle in the United States, additional sporadic human infections are anticipated.\n\n\"Continued comprehensive surveillance of these viruses in wild birds, poultry, mammals, and people worldwide, and frequent reassessments are critical to determine the public health risk, along with ongoing preparedness efforts.\"\n\nBoth known human cases in the U.S., which occurred in Colorado in 2022 and in Texas earlier this year, were among farm workers who handled sick animals, said Dodd, whose lab is part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which she described as \"the first line of defense in the case of an incursion of a high consequence, the animal disease or avian disease like H5N1 avian influenza.\"\n\nBut still, she said, \"identifying highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle populations was unexpected. We are learning a lot as we go forward.\"\n\nThe CDC said people who are exposed to birds, cows or any other animal infected with H5N1 virus are at higher risk of infection than the general public.\n\nAvian flu sparks new pandemic concerns\n\nWith the coronavirus pandemic so fresh in public consciousness, there's fear that this avian influenza virus could mutate in a way that would allow it to more readily spill over from animals to people, and then potentially from person to person — triggering another deadly viral scourge.\n\n\"When you start to see it in multiple birds, that's a concern. When it gets to multiple mammals, that's getting pretty worrisome. And now that it's in our broad-scale commercial system with milk, we've got increasing touchpoints with the human-animal interface and opportunities for zoonotic spillover,\" said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"I really want to stress that if avian flu breaks out in humans, it could be a lot worse than COVID. The fatality rates are much, much higher.\"\n\nCernak pointed to the high bird flu mortality rate in people from Cambodia who were infected with a different subtype of the H5N1 virus than what's currently circulating in the U.S. Of 64 people who contracted the virus from 2003-23 in Cambodia, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"That's not the strain that's here,\" Cernak said, but \"you can imagine that is not something we want to deal with.\"\n\nCernak's work centers on using artificial intelligence to develop a new antiviral drug that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak.\n\n\"The good news is, we know a lot about antivirals. We know a lot about how to make drugs and AI is really an awesome tool to accelerate that,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how big the outbreak among dairy cattle actually is — or whether there have been more human cases that have gone undetected, said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations, including the CDC, in a post on her substack, \"Your Local Epidemiologist,\" which she co-wrote with Dr. Kristen Panthagani.\n\n\"Symptomatic testing of animals and humans is voluntary, and asymptomatic testing is not happening (likely due to industry pressure), which means we are flying blind,\" she and Panthagani wrote. \"It’s been reported that more workers have symptoms — such as fever, cough, and lethargy — but are unwilling to test. We could have more human cases. Among the tests conducted, it’s unclear how many have been done, how many were positive, and how many humans have been exposed.\"\n\nAnd with 1 in 5 samples of commercial milk testing positive for DNA fragments of the H5N1 virus, Jetelina and Panthagani say it's likely that the virus is far more widespread among cows than previously believed.\n\nHow sick does the current strain of bird flu make people?\n\nThe H5N1 strain that jumped from birds to cows and then to people is the subtype 2.3.4.4b, according to the CDC.\n\nScientists refer to it as being \"highly pathogenic.\" What that means, Dodd said, is that this particular variation of bird flu is especially deadly for chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks and other poultry raised for the production of meat or eggs for the food supply.\n\nIt does not, however, mean the virus causes severe illness or death in other animals or humans.\n\nThe two people with known cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. had very mild illnesses, the CDC reported:\n\nA Texas farm worker who was exposed to sick cows in March had only one symptom: eye redness consistent with conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. The person was treated with an antiviral flu drug, was asked to isolate to prevent potentially spreading the virus, and recovered.\n\nIn April 2022, a Colorado farm worker who culled poultry suspected of being infected with the H5N1 flu virus reported feeling fatigue for several days. The person tested positive for the virus and was isolated and also treated with a flu antiviral drug.\n\n“To date, this strain of avian influenza has not been associated with significant disease in humans,\" Dodd said.\n\n“In the case of the dairy cows, we know that there was one individual working closely with infected cattle who did develop a little bit of conjunctivitis. There's a lot of work ongoing to perform surveillance on individuals who work closely with some of the infected animals.\n\n\"And, to date, we don't have any indication that this is causing disease in people. It’s a really important thing to keep in mind: This is low risk for the human population.\"\n\nThe bird flu's leap to mammals\n\nIn May 2022, H5N1 was first detected in red foxes in Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, New York, Alaska and Wisconsin. It's possible they ate the carcasses of birds that had died from avian influenza, Dodd said, and got infected.\n\nBobcats in Wisconsin, opossums in Iowa and bottle-nosed dolphins in Florida also were sickened by bird flu in 2022, according to the USDA.\n\nThen came raccoons in Washington and skunks in Idaho. Harbor seals and gray seals in Maine got sick, as did grizzly and Kodiak bears, polar bears and black bears in Alaska.\n\nIt killed elephant seals in Argentina, and infected Antarctic penguins.\n\nBut it wasn't until late 2023 when the H5N1 virus was likely transmitted for the first time from a bird to a cow, according to Dr. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, who worked with others this month to analyze the genetic sequences of the H5N1 virus.\n\nHe wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that there is a \"strong possibility that this has been circulating in cattle for months under our noses, even before the first inkling there might be something new in February. This reveals massive gaps in our pathogen surveillance and detection systems.\"\n\nThough Worobey's work suggests bird flu was spreading in cows in late 2023, the first known dairy cattle H5N1 infections weren't reported by the USDA until March 25, when the agency said it had identified cases in Texas and Kansas.\n\nA few days later, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that asymptomatic cows from Texas had brought the bird flu to a Montcalm County farm.\n\n\"Further testing and investigation by state and federal officials have revealed the source of infection,\" MDARD said in a news release at the time. \"The farm recently received cattle from an affected premises in Texas before that herd showed any sign of disease. When the cattle were moved from Texas to Michigan, the cattle were not symptomatic and did not appear ill.\"\n\nThe cows that were sick had decreased lactation and low appetite. Farmers were instructed to isolate the cows, minimize their exposure to visitors and to prevent them from contact with other animals and wildlife.\n\nBut despite the precautions, the virus continued to spread. MDARD reported that H5N1 now has infected dairy cattle from Ionia, Isabella, and Ottawa counties, too, along with seven other states.\n\n\"This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert,\" said MDARD Director Tim Boring, in a statement. \"This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities.\"\n\nAnd, Dodd said, some barn cats that drank raw milk from sick cows also were infected with bird flu.\n\nWhere in Michigan has the bird flu been found in poultry?\n\nThe H5N1 virus was first identified in Michigan in February 2022 in Kalamazoo County, according to the CDC.\n\nEven though federal law requires the culling of the entire flock if even one bird is identified as having avian influenza, by the end of 2022, the virus had spread to domestic birds in more than a dozen Michigan counties: Eaton, Lapeer, Macomb, Muskegon, Oakland, Branch, Wexford, Saginaw, Menominee, Livingston, Genesee, Tuscola, Ingham and Sanilac.\n\nSince then, outbreaks of the H5N1 virus also have been identified in poultry farms, turkey meat farms and commercial table egg laying facilities across Michigan, including in Bay, Cass, Gratiot, Ionia, Montmorency, Livingston, Newaygo, Ottawa, and Washtenaw counties.\n\nIs H5N1 flu in the U.S. milk supply?\n\nYes, but it's not likely to make you sick if you drink pasteurized milk, the FDA says.\n\nRoughly 99% of the nation's milk comes from farms that adhere to the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, according to the FDA. That ordinance includes safety measures that require milk from sick cows to either be diverted or destroyed; it isn't used in the commercial milk supply. Additionally, milk must undergo pasteurization, which uses heat to deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria.\n\nStill, the FDA announced earlier this week that it detected fragments of the H5N1 virus in the commercial pasteurized milk supply, and pledged to continue investigating.\n\nAuthorities used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, which can detect viral DNA particles, but does not identify whether those bits of DNA are capable of replicating or causing disease.\n\n\"Because qPCR findings do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers, the FDA is further assessing any positive findings,\" the agency said in a statement issued Tuesday. \"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\n\n\"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles. Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) HPAI.\"\n\nDr. Lea Monday, an infectious diseases physician at the Detroit Medical Center, said she and her children continue to drink pasteurized milk and and eat cheese products made with pasteurized milk.\n\n\"The virus remnants that were found in the pasteurized milk are just pieces of H5N1 DNA,\" Monday said. \"It's broken-down virus remnants, but not actual live virus. ... People don't have to worry about getting bird flu through cow's milk if they're drinking it, and it's pasteurized.\"\n\nHealth officials warn: Don't drink raw milk\n\n\"It's really important for people to realize that although there's no documented evidence of someone getting sick with H5N1 from drinking raw milk, if it hasn't been pasteurized, it could have viral particles that could potentially be infectious,\" Monday said.\n\n\"And there are other things that could be passed to you through raw milk like listeria and brucella that cause very dangerous infections that have extremely high rates of mortality. Listeria causes stillbirth and miscarriage and death. So that's another reason we should not be consuming raw, unpasteurized dairy products.\"\n\nIs it safe to eat beef, eggs and poultry?\n\nThe USDA says the nation's meat and supply is safe. Animals are inspected prior to slaughter to ensure sick livestock do not enter the food supply.\n\nThe FDA says eggs sold in the retail market also are likely to be safe to eat: \"The likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low and proper storage and preparation further reduce the risk.\"\n\nDodd now more than ever, it's important to thoroughly cook eggs, poultry and beef to kill off any bacteria or viruses in chicken, duck, goose, turkey or beef.\n\n\"At this point, there is no indication of detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in muscle or meat,\" she said. \"And again, I say that is to this point. I don't have reason to expect that is going to change.\"\n\nHow worried should I be about H5N1 becoming more infectious?\n\n\"I think the average American should not be overly concerned about their personal risk at this moment,\" said Aubree Gordon, a professor or epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan. She also is director of the Michigan Center for Infectious Disease Threats and Pandemic Preparedness.\n\nHowever, she said, there ought to be scrutiny about whether U.S. public health agencies are doing enough to identify the true scope of avian influenza's spread.\n\n\"There were a lot of lessons that we certainly should have learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the prior pandemics,\" Gordon said, \"especially in making sure there's enough surveillance going on.\n\n\"The dairy industry has a lot of power. It has a lot of money. I do think it's really critical at this moment that the situation is extremely carefully monitored and that there's a lot of surveillance so that we know what's happening.\"\n\nAmong her biggest concerns is that the H5N1 virus will soon begin to infect pigs.\n\n\"Pigs can be a bit of a mixing vessel for flu,\" Gordon said. \"They have some of the same receptors that humans have and a virus that transmits well amongst pigs may transmit well amongst humans.\"\n\nShe suggested the USDA should carefully monitor swine for avian influenza infections and public health authorities ought to consider PCR testing of people who have flu-like symptoms.\n\n\"There’s been a shift toward rapid testing for flu, and I’m concerned about that with H5N1 emerging,\" Gordon said.

But as the virus has shown the ability to transfer from species to species, the CDC is ramping up its response.\n\nOn Tuesday, the agency released a variety of data, including information on wastewater sampling sites that have tested positive for influenza A, of which the avian influenza (H5N1) is a subtype.\n\nThe new dashboard presents the data in the form of graphs and charts, comparing positive tests in a region to the same time a year prior.\n\n\"By tracking the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza A viruses, we can monitor for unusual increases in influenza activity that may be an early sign of spread of novel influenza A viruses, including H5N1,\" the CDC said in its report.\n\nSee the bird flu dashboard on the CDC website.\n\nBird flu graphic:A visual guide on avian bird flu outbreak and how it's affecting dairy cows\n\nWhat data does the CDC dashboard include?\n\nWhile the CDC monitors cases of the flu year round, the new dashboard is meant to serve as a tool to ramp up surveillance efforts of bird flu cases at the national, state and local levels.\n\nThe agency is monitoring 260 people who have been exposed to dairy cows infected with H5N1. In a bit of good news, for the week ended May 10, the agency's surveillance system did not otherwise show any indications of unusual flu activity in people, including the H5N1 virus.\n\nThe first-ever reported bird flu case infecting a human occurred in 2022 following exposure to infected poultry, the CDC said. A second case was reported this year in Texas following exposure to infected dairy cattle.\n\nThe CDC has also been testing wastewater from sewers to detect mutations in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans.\n\nFor the week ending May 4, 189 wastewater sampling sites across the U.S. showed higher-than-average levels of influenza A and required further analysis, the CDC said. In Saline County, Kansas, influenza A levels were particularly high, the data show.\n\n\"The data from these sites are being closely monitored by CDC and its partners to identify potential contributing factors, including assessing whether any of the high levels are related to any human illness,\" the CDC said in its report.\n\nThe CDC cautioned that wastewater monitoring methods aren't yet capable of distinguishing between subtypes of influenza A, meaning that the bird flu cannot be accurately detected this way. Wastewater testing is also incapable of determining the source of the influenza A virus – it could come from a human, from animals or from animal products like milk.\n\n\"Efforts to monitor influenza A virus activity using wastewater data are likely to evolve as the methodologies and interpretation are evaluated and refined,\" the CDC said.\n\nBird flu has been spreading to dairy cows in US\n\nHealth officials have expressed growing concern over the recent spread of the avian flu virus, which has already passed from birds to other animals, including cows.\n\nSo far, a total of 42 cattle herds at farms in nine states have been infected, according to federal officials.\n\nTo contain the virus' spread, the federal government has increased direct financial aid to dairy farms and testing tools for dairy workers and cattle. The additional $28,000 in funding per impacted farm would expand testing, underwrite costs for farms that provide protective gear for workers and compensate farms for veterinary bills and lost milk production in the next four months.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also will spend $101 million on testing and prevention efforts, while the CDC will spend $93 million to expand testing and monitoring of the virus.\n\nRisk to general public remains low\n\nThe larger concern is that the virus might evolve to become easily transmitted to people. Bird flu is considered more dangerous than the annual flu because it's a strain humans have never encountered and it's likely to be highly contagious.\n\n\"There's no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,\" Dr. Raj Panjabi of Harvard Medical School and the former White House senior director for global health security and biodefense on the United States National Security Council, told USA TODAY. \"It's the moment to get ready to step up investments in public health, especially around prevention, protection and preparedness,\"\n\nFederal officials said last week that the latest round of testing proves the commercial milk supply is safe, as are milk-based products like cottage cheese and sour cream.\n\nHowever, agencies like the CDC, FDA and USDA are warning consumers to not drink unpasteurized milk, which may harbor the virus.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.\n\nBird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nWhat are signs of bird flu?\n\nSymptoms of bird flu include:\n\nLoss of appetite, lethargy.\n\nDeath without prior symptoms.\n\nEyelid swelling.\n\nTwisting of the head and neck.\n\nPurple discoloration to body parts, including legs.\n\n'No concern' about commercial milk supply safety\n\n\"At this stage,\" the USDA wrote, there is \"no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health.\"\n\nDairies are required to send milk from healthy animals into processing before it can be put on grocery shelves, the agency said, and the milk from the sick animals was being destroyed.\n\nIn addition, USDA officials said, pasteurization \"has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses,\" including influenza, in milk.\n\nIt's also required for milk entering interstate commerce.\n\n\"For the dairies whose herds are exhibiting symptoms, on average about ten percent of each affected herd appears to be impacted, with little to no associated mortality reported among the animals,\" the USDA wrote in its release. \"Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The person was treated with antiviral medication for respiratory symptoms and is recovering.\n\nAs with the first human bird flu case in Michigan, which was announced May 22, the state health department would not disclose on which farm the person worked, in which county the infection occurred or even which region of the state is involved.\n\n\"It's just to protect farm and worker privacy. These are small towns,\" said Chelsea Wuth, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWuth did say, however, that Michigan's two infected farmworkers are employed at separate farms in a county (or counties) with a known dairy cattle H5N1 outbreak. There does not appear to be human-to-human spread of the virus at this time.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were 23 outbreaks in dairy cattle herds in 10 Michigan counties: Allegan, Barry, Calhoun, Clinton, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm and Ottawa, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nWhat's distinct about the latest case is that the worker reported upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.\n\nThe other two known human cases of cow-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza — in Michigan and Texas farmworkers — reported conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pinkeye, as their only symptom.\n\n\"Most influenza presents as a respiratory virus,\" said Joe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, \"so that's not necessarily terribly surprising. But this is the first case that has had these types of symptoms in the country. And, generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas.\n\n\"It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure.\"\n\nThe CDC reported that the person was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored for symptoms and also have been offered antiviral medication.\n\n\"No other workers at the same farm have reported symptoms, and all staff are being monitored,\" the CDC reported Thursday.\n\nDr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, said the newest case of avian influenza in a Michigander was identified through a swift public health response that encourages farm owners and workers to report even mild symptoms and provides access to testing.\n\n“With the first case in Michigan, eye symptoms occurred after a direct splash of infected milk to the eye,\" she said in a statement. \"With this case, respiratory symptoms occurred after direct exposure to an infected cow. Neither individual was wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n\"This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms. We have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the current health risk to the general public remains low.”\n\nMore:Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to human\n\nMore:Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be next\n\nThe risk is higher for people who have prolonged or close contact with infected birds, cattle or other animals and for people who spend time in environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, the CDC said.\n\nThat includes not only poultry and cattle farmers and workers, but also those who work in slaughterhouses, people who have backyard flocks, veterinarians and veterinary staff, and others who work in animal and public health.\n\n\"Given the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, additional human cases in people with higher risk exposures would not be surprising,\" the CDC said in a statement released Thursday. \"A CDC priority right now is to prevent additional cases of A(H5N1) infections in dairy herd workers, who are at higher risk of exposure.\"\n\nThe agency urges people to avoid consuming raw milk and to stay away from sick animals along with potentially contaminated surfaces and water (such as ponds, bogs and troughs) on farms with potentially infected animals. It also suggests avoiding contact with the udders of lactating dairy cattle; the feces, bedding or litter of potentially infected animals, and the carcasses of animals — especially birds and livestock — that have died from an unknown cause.\n\nThose who must work around infected animals are urged to wear such PPE as a waterproof apron, respirator mask, safety goggles or a face shield, gloves, a head covering and boots or boot covers.\n\nThe first Michigan case of the H5N1 influenza virus in a human was identified through the text messaging surveillance program MDHHS developed that allows farmworkers to report daily whether they have any symptoms that could be tied to bird flu, Coyle said.\n\nBut with the second case, detection came about through collaboration between state agriculture workers and public health.\n\nWhen MDARD identifies infected cattle herds, state agricultural workers reach out to the farm owners, Coyle said.\n\n\"We asked MDARD, 'When you do that first outreach to the farm, can you please let the farm owner or the producer know that local public health will be following up?' \" he said. \"One of the critical questions that they're going to ask is: 'Do you have any sick people?' And so when MDARD started to make that initial outreach to the farm, and local public health followed up, the producer said, 'Oh, yes, there has been someone who has been sick.'\n\n\"It was through the public health follow-up with the farm that we were able to identify that person as being ill and then rapidly worked to get them tested.\"\n\nSpecimens were collected from the farmworker and tested by the state Bureau of Labs. The CDC said it confirmed the H5 infection Wednesday night, and genetic sequencing is underway to determine whether there are any concerning changes to the virus.\n\nSequencing of the virus that infected the first Michigan dairy farmworker showed a mutation that allows mammals to be infected with this strain of bird flu more easily, the CDC reported last week, but did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

If it stays in birds, the main danger is to poultry. Flocks of chickens have had to be killed and eggs destroyed.\n\nThe larger concern is that it might evolve to become easily transmitted person-to-person.

They continue to test people who work on farms and only one person is known to have caught the virus in recent months. Vaccines and antivirals should be available if bird flu becomes transmissible from person to person.\n\nBut public health officials say they suspect more people have caught the virus from animals than we're aware of, and the chance of a bird flu pandemic cannot be ruled out.\n\nBhadelia said the absence of more human infections so far may reflect a lack of testing rather than a lack of actual infections.\n\n\"If I were a betting person, I would say there have probably been more human infections than what we've detected already in this country,\" she said. \"I would bet part of my retirement on that.\"\n\nIn interviews this week, she and other leading epidemiologists, infectious disease, public policy and dairy industry experts, outlined four major concerns about bird flu, and one area where they feel mostly reassured:\n\nIt's called 'bird flu' but it's now in cows and other animals\n\nWhat makes the outbreak so concerning is that the bird flu virus already has jumped from birds to other animals, including cows.\n\nThis form of avian influenza, a strain called H5N1, has been around since at least 1997, but it mutated a few years ago to become adaptable to more kinds of bird species as well as to mammals. Since then, it's been found in a range of animals, including a bottlenose dolphin off the coast of Florida in March 2022 and 29 house cats in Poland in June 2023.\n\nBut finding it on American cattle farms in early February was still a surprise, said Gerry Parker, associate dean for Global One Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Cows are not considered especially vulnerable to flu.\n\nA virus that can thrive in a range of mammals might thrive in humans.\n\n\"The probability is going up that we might get a genetic reassortment that could turn this into a human virus,\" Parker said. \"We don't know that, but as this continues to circulate into more mammalian species, the likelihood just increases. It may never happen but if it did, it could easily become a potential pandemic threat.\"\n\nDo we really know where it's spread?\n\nBird flu initially struck a single dairy farm in the Texas panhandle and spread to other dairy farms from there, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nBut it's still not clear exactly where the flu virus has spread or what it's capable of, said several experts, including Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\n\"Our surveillance is inadequate to know where this virus is and where it isn't, which is critical for protecting farmworkers and people involved in the dairy industry ‒ but also important for staying ahead of this virus to prevent a future pandemic,\" Nuzzo said.\n\nAbout 100 people working on dairy and cattle farms have been tested for active infections. Nuzzo and others said testing should be more widespread and should also include tests to see whether some had already recovered from infections.\n\n\"If there are a lot more people infected who aren't sick enough to go to the hospital, that would be important to know,\" Nuzzo said. \"We have to have a much stronger conversation about how to improve our surveillance.\"\n\nIt's also unclear exactly how this virus is being transmitted among animals, which is crucial information for slowing or stopping the spread and protecting people working on farms.\n\nAlthough flu is typically a respiratory virus passed through the air and by touching contaminated surfaces, it has behaved differently among cows; at least some of the transmission appears to be through unpasteurized milk. Farm cats have contracted the virus, potentially by drinking this milk.\n\n\"We think milk is the primary vector for movement (of the virus),\" Sifford told reporters.\n\nMilking equipment is cleaned but not sterilized between cows, Parker said, so the virus may be transmitted when one cow with the virus in her milk leaves some of it on the machine to be picked up by the next cow's udder.\n\nThe cows also passed it back to birds. Eight poultry flocks located near infected dairy herds contracted the virus after the cows did, though how they got it remains unclear.\n\nNo one knows how sick a person might get if they catch H5N1.\n\nBirds often die; most cows, so far, have recovered from their infections, said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation.\n\nThe one farmworker in Texas who caught bird flu only suffered from an eye infection and apparently recovered fully. Bhadelia speculated he might have caught it by touching his eye after touching contaminated milking equipment, which is why the infection was focused on his eye.\n\nSince 1997, about half the people hospitalized globally with bird flu have died. But Bhadelia said many more might have caught the virus from direct interactions with infected birds and never showed symptoms or were so mildly ill that they never required treatment ‒ so the actual death rate is unknown. Plus, if the virus did adapt to become transmissible in people, it might become milder, though we can't count on that, she said.\n\nIn any kind of emerging crisis, there's never enough data, Parker said. \"I call it the fog of war,\" he said.\n\nWorkers may not be adequately protected\n\nAlthough the average American is not at risk right from bird flu, farmworkers, especially those working around poultry and cattle, probably are.\n\n\"We've been so fixated on, 'Is this going to become a pandemic?' and not enough on 'There's a threat on our farms today,'\" Nuzzo said. \"We should not wait for a severe illness in order to protect farmworkers.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended dairy workers and people who come onto dairy farms use eye protection, wash their hands frequently and wear things like disposable coveralls if they travel from farm to farm, so as not to carry the virus with them, Jonker noted.\n\nIn addition to the basic worries about worker health, the more workers become infected, the greater the risk one of them won't be able to clear the virus quickly. Viruses evolve as they pass from person to person but also within a single person, especially if they don't shake it off quickly, Bhadelia said.\n\n\"The more people it infects, and the longer it adapts to the human body,\" she said, the more likely the virus will become contagious ‒ and dangerous ‒ to other people.\n\nYes, there are vaccines and antivirals, but...\n\nUnfortunately, even people who've gotten annual flu shots or caught the flu recently won't have any protection against the H5N1 strain, said Lawrence Gostin, a leader in global health at Georgetown University, where he is faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.\n\nThe federal government has flu vaccine and antiviral stockpiles that theoretically could be useful if H5N1 becomes easily transmissible among people.\n\nBut public health experts say the reality is much more complicated.\n\nThere won't be enough for everyone and the vaccine that's been stockpiled hasn't been tested to prove it can effectively prevent infection or severe disease.\n\n\"I don't know that anyone has a vaccine that's been tested thoroughly that anyone would be really confident about its effectiveness,\" said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a professor at the UMass Chan Medical School and member of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. \"Part of the problem is we don't actually know what that virus is until it appears.\"\n\nTwo companies are testing a candidate vaccine in early trials, David Boucher, a top official within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said at the news conference.\n\nIf the virus moves from animals into people, it will continue to mutate, so existing vaccines might not be effective and it's challenging to develop and test a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist, Luban said.\n\nSuch testing would take time and the flu virus, which mutates much faster than the virus that causes COVID-19, would continue to transform.\n\nAntivirals, like Tamiflu, are likely to be effective against bird flu, federal officials say.\n\nBut they need to be taken within the first day or two after infection starts, at a time when most people aren't even sure whether they are sick and well before they have time to make a doctor's appointment and get and fulfill a prescription for an antiviral.\n\nBut the food supply is almost certainly safe\n\nBoth public health and federal officials reassured the public about the safety of the commercial food supply.\n\nConcerns about bird flu passing through milk is another reason people should avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, Nuzzo said.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk,\" she said. \"We just added a new one.\"\n\nThe point of pasteurization is to kill pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration has tested 297 commercial samples that had evidence of the H5N1 virus, including 96 milk samples and another 200 products made with milk, like cottage cheese and sour cream. In all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and posed no health risk, said Dr. Donald A. Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\n\nThe agency also tested infant and toddler formula and found no viral particles at all, Prater told reporters.\n\nSurveillance on poultry farms is more extensive than on cattle farms because bird flu has been seen in birds for much longer, Jonker and others said. At the first sign of infection on an egg or chicken farm, animals are \"culled,\" a polite way of saying \"killed\" and their eggs destroyed. The government long ago set aside funds to compensate farmers for having to take such drastic actions, he said.\n\nThe meat supply is almost certainly safe, Emilio Esteban USDA's Under Secretary for Food Safety, told reporters.\n\nHe said animals are inspected before slaughter and carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter. \"We are confident the meat supply is safe,\" he said.\n\nFor extra security, his department is now running tests on retail samples of ground beef purchased from states where dairy herds have been affected by bird flu, along with muscle from cows killed after being infected with bird flu and from beef patties cooked at three different temperatures to document that cooking kills any virus that might remain in the meat.\n\n\"We are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe,\" he said. \"We are doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure we have additional data points.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/958623/h5n1-the-global-bird-killer-threatening-the-uk", "title": "H5N1: bird flu in mammals stoking fears of human 'spill-over' | The ...", "text": "The spread of bird flu to mammals, including foxes and otters in Britain, has stoked fears that the virus could one day pass between humans in a pandemic like Covid-19.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) maintains that the avian influenza H5N1 virus is still primarily a disease of birds, but experts around the world are “looking at the risks of it spilling over into other species”, said the BBC.\n\nWhile some think the chance of human-to-human transmission is low, an outbreak among mink in Spain has caused particular concern.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

More than 700 seals were found dead in December in the Caspian Sea, near to the site of a large outbreak of H5N1 in wild birds months earlier.\n\nHow does avian flu spread to mammals?\n\nIn the UK, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has tested 66 different species of mammals, and found four otters and five foxes were positive for avian flu.\n\nWhile there is currently no evidence that bird flu can spread from fox to fox or otter to otter, “genetic sequencing of the virus from an October 2022 outbreak on a mink farm in Spain suggests the animals were infected with a new variant of H5N1 that could spread between mink”, said New Scientist.\n\nMunir Iqbal, from the Pirbright Institute, told the magazine that more investigation is needed to confirm mammal-to-mammal transmission.\n\nIt has nevertheless “reignited long-smouldering fears that H5N1 could trigger a human pandemic”, said Science magazine.\n\nAre these fears well founded?\n\nHumans can catch bird flu. There have been six confirmed infections in the latest worldwide wave, including one death. But there is currently “no evidence that the virus can pass between humans”, the i news site said. The latest cases were all acquired “directly from close contact with poultry or other birds”.\n\n“Yet researchers are worried that if the H5N1 virus mutates to transmit between mammals, it could soon be able to jump between human hosts,” said the New Scientist.\n\nThe discovery of H5N1 in the two UK mammal species has triggered a move to more “targeted surveillance and testing of animals and humans exposed to the virus in the UK”, said the BBC.\n\nProf Ian Brown, APHA’s director of scientific services, told the broadcaster he was “acutely aware of the risks” of bird flu becoming a pandemic like Covid-19. “We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease,” he said.\n\nMarion Koopmans, head of the department of virology at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam and a member of the World Health Organization team charged with tracing the origins of Covid, said: “We are playing with fire.”\n\nIf it can spread between mammals, there is an “opportunity for a virus from the risk list to pick up mutations which could make it transmissible between humans”, she said. “It didn’t happen this time, and it may not happen, but this is one of the scenarios from which a new pandemic could originate.”\n\nWhere did the new virus come from?\n\nBird flu, mostly of a mild kind, has always existed in birds, particularly migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks (songbirds are largely unaffected). However, a new form of the H5N1 virus emerged in Asia in the 1990s in intensive poultry farms, an ideal viral breeding ground.\n\nThis was first detected in Guangdong province, southern China, in 1996, and spread to chicken farms in Hong Kong a year later, where it killed six people. In 2005, the virus caused a large outbreak among wild birds in Lake Qinghai in China, where nearly 200 migratory breeds congregated near large poultry farms.\n\nSince then, the virus has infected wild birds in Europe, the Middle East and North America, and now circulates the world most years, often infecting farmed birds. The latest outbreak hit the UK in October 2021.\n\nHow is the situation different this time?\n\nWith a reproduction number as high as 100 (each infected bird can infect about 100 others), the latest bout of H5N1 has spread exceptionally quickly. It is “highly pathogenic”: it causes respiratory problems and diarrhoea, and is often fatal.\n\nIn previous years, outbreaks in Britain have been caused by migratory waterbirds arriving from Europe and the Arctic in autumn and winter, bringing the virus with them; but outbreaks have historically fizzled out once those birds have left in the spring.\n\nThis time has been different. For the first time, H5N1 spread to Britain’s nonmigratory wild birds, possibly owing to a mutation in the virus. In particular, it has affected seabirds, which live in huge, dense colonies on Britain’s cliffs and islands, making it easy for the virus to take hold.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nIn October, the Department of Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) imposed a bird flu “prevention zone” across the whole of Great Britain: free-range birds were to be kept within fenced areas, and other strict biosecurity measures were imposed. In November, Defra ordered all poultry and captive birds in England to be housed indoors; free-range eggs will be relabelled “barn-laid”. Those who have had to cull flocks are being compensated.\n\nBut some have criticised a lack of urgency in the official response. As bird flu spread through the Farne Islands last summer, for instance, not a single bird was tested for the virus. Guidance on collecting birds has been criticised as “patchy”, resulting in decaying corpses being left on the islands for weeks.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Susan Caskie", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/22/bird-flu-spreads-cats-mammals/74181948007/", "title": "Bird flu infects dozens of mammal species; protecting cats from H5N1", "text": "The concerning bird flu outbreak that has spread to four humans so far as it expands quickly in the U.S. has jumped to dozens of species, infecting mammals in at least 31 states.\n\nAmong those infected are cows in 12 states, foxes, mice, striped skunks, mountain lions and harbor seals, and alpacas.\n\nAt least 21 domestic cats in nine states have caught the virus since March 1, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Cats that have tested positive include feral, barn cats and household pets.\n\nWhile it's possible a human could become sick from their furry friends, it's not very likely, the CDC says. The H5N1 virus could be spread through cats' saliva, feces or other body fluids. All the people who caught it were exposed on farms and fully recovered, and officials are working to reduce the spread.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nVirus spreading:Concerns grow as 'gigantic' bird flu outbreak runs rampant in US dairy herds\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nThe short answer? Yes, cats can contract bird flu if they interact with infected birds.\n\nBird flu is primarily considered a transmission risk between wild birds and domestic birds; more recent presence of bird flu in dairy cows is believed to be a first for the species.\n\nResearchers at Cornell University believe the affected Texas dairy cows were infected via water and food sources contaminated by wild birds migrating through the area. It was then likely spread between cows in close quarters.\n\nDr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, was called to an affected dairy farm in March to investigate the deaths of cows, birds and cats at the facility. Frye determined the presence of the illness in the cows using milk samples, manure and nasal swabs.\n\nTesting was also done on dead birds found on the farm, as well as one of three cats found dead at the facilities around the same time. All the tests turned up evidence of the presence of bird flu.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye previously told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHave cats been affected by bird flu in the past?\n\nThe CDC has records of sporadic mammalian outbreaks of the bird flu in the past, impacting both wild animals like foxes and bears, as well as pets like dogs and cats. Officials believe these cases are caused by the animals consuming infected birds and poultry.\n\nIn 2004, an outbreak in domestic animals including cats and dogs was reported in Thailand, and another outbreak impacting pets occurred in Germany and North America in 2006. The organization says humans contracting the virus from their pets is very rare and unlikely but has happened as a result of prolonged, unprotected exposure.\n\nIn 2016, a veterinarian in New York City contracted bird flu from repeated exposure to sick cats without protective gear. The vet suffered mild flu symptoms.\n\nSigns your pet may be sick\n\nThe likelihood of your cat contracting bird flu is minimal. However, it can happen if your cat is often outside and ends up eating or getting too cozy with an infected bird, or hangs out in a contaminated environment.\n\nIf you suspect people or animals in your home have been around a sick or dead bird, you should monitor them closely for these signs:\n\nFever or feeling feverish/chills.\n\nCough.\n\nSore throat.\n\nDifficulty breathing/shortness of breath.\n\nConjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye).\n\nHeadaches.\n\nRunny or stuffy nose.\n\nMuscle or body aches.\n\nDiarrhea.\n\nHow to prevent the spread of bird flu\n\nAvoiding exposure in the first place is the most effective way to stop the spread, says the CDC.\n\nAvoid direct contact with wild birds and observe wild birds only from a distance, whenever possible.\n\nAvoid contact between pets (e.g., pet birds, dogs and cats) with wild birds.\n\nDon’t touch sick or dead birds, their feces or litter or any surface or water source (e.g., ponds, waterers, buckets, pans, troughs) that might be contaminated with their saliva, feces, or any other bodily fluids without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nAvoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other sick animals.\n\nChange your clothes after contact with wild birds, poultry and sick animals.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/27/cats-bird-flu-risk-humans/77236773007/", "title": "Experts worry about cats and bird flu. Should owners care?", "text": "Cats of all shapes and sizes have come down with bird flu.\n\nFirst there were barn cats that drank raw milk. In recent days, 20 wild cats at a Washington State animal sanctuary that probably ate infected birds, and reports of indoor cats that died from eating contaminated raw food.\n\nThough more may have been infected without attracting the attention of owners or veterinarians, the ones that did often suffered terrible neurological symptoms like tremors, seizures and blindness.\n\nInfected cats that have been identified have died at high rates. Their unique roles in our homes and the animal kingdom could put them − and us − at greater risk. Here's why.\n\nWhy do cats get bird flu?\n\nUnlike many dogs, cats explore and hunt smaller prey, such as birds and mice, which can carry bird flu. By their very nature, cats have more \"opportunity\" to get infected with bird flu, said Dr. Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), which has released guidance for cat owners.\n\n“We don't know if the cats are more susceptible than anybody else,” he said. “It's just the fact they're exposed to higher viral burdens because of where they go.”\n\nDomestic cats have been known to carry bird flu since 2004.\n\nBut the death rates seen in the current U.S. outbreak seem dramatically higher than what's been seen around the world, said Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.\n\nBefore, about half of cats died, now with bird flu spreading among cows, about 90% seem to be dying, said Coleman, who has been tracking those deaths.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of bird flu in cats?\n\nThe AVMA recommends pet owners look out for signs such as loss of appetite, lethargy and fever. A bird flu infection can quickly progress with neurologic signs, such as tremors, seizures, not being coordinated, or blindness.\n\nAdditionally, cats can have severe depression, discharge from their eyes or nose, and respiratory signs like rapid breathing, shortness of breath, and sneezing or coughing.\n\nIf your cat shows these symptoms and you think it might have been exposed to bird flu, also known as H5N1, you should call a veterinarian immediately.\n\nSick animals may be able to transmit influenza virus to people in their saliva, poop and other bodily fluids. People can get infected by breathing in the virus or by touching something that has virus on it and then touching their mouth, eyes, or nose.\n\nIf you suspect your cat may be infected with bird flu ‒ or any other potentially infectious disease ‒ try to limit their contact with other pets and people in your household, particularly anyone who is immunocompromised, while waiting for veterinary guidance, according to the AVMA. Although the risk of cats spreading H5N1 to humans is considered extremely low, it is not zero.\n\nFollowing guidance from the CDC, you should monitor yourself and your family for any flu-like symptoms and contact a healthcare provider if concerns arise. Wash your hands after handling your cat or cleaning up after them, such as their litter boxes or bedding.\n\nHow do I protect my outdoor cat?\n\nCats that spend time outdoors are at greater risk with exposure from dead animals, as well as wild birds or mice, which can also carry bird flu.\n\nBailey and Coleman recommend trying to reduce their time outside.\n\nThe main goal, both said, is to reduce their risk of consuming a dead animal, and certainly to stop it from bringing any dead animals into your home.\n\nHow do I protect my indoor cat?\n\nCats indoors have a lower risk of contracting bird flu, but people should still take precautions.\n\nPeople should avoid feeding their cats raw foods, like uncooked meat or unpasteurized milk, since these can contain virus. Raw food for pets has been trending, but the AVMA discourages people from feeding dogs or cats raw or undercooked animal-sourced food. Cooking meat or pasteurizing milk neutralizes the virus.\n\nMice can also end up in homes. Cats can be great pest control, but an infected mouse could pose threats to their health.\n\nPeople should wash their hands after touching their cat and after encountering wild birds, livestock or other animals, the AVMA said. If a person has been in contact or near sick or dead animals, they should change clothes and shoes and wash any exposed skin.\n\nWhat about dogs?\n\nWhile dogs have previously contracted bird flu, for now, they appear less susceptible to it than cats, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBird flu hasn't been found in dogs in the U.S.\n\nThe same precautions taken for cats should also be used to protect dogs, according to a Dec. 13 FDA update.\n\n‘Mixing vessels’\n\nMore than 60 people have been infected with bird flu in the U.S., mostly with mild symptoms. People have mostly gotten sick while working on dairy or poultry farms. There has been no transmission between humans yet.\n\nCats haven’t been known as a main spreader of virus circulating in the U.S. ‒ but that could change in the future.\n\n“If us humans don’t care for our animals, it’s probably not going to end well for us,” Coleman said.\n\nCats can not only catch bird flu, they can also catch human flu viruses. That means cats can serve as a \"mixing vessel\" for the two types of flu, allowing them to combine and create a version of bird flu that is much more likely to infect people, according to a study published in December.\n\nThe U.S. isn't fully capturing spread in pets like cats, compared to surveillance for livestock and people, said the study’s senior author, Suresh Kuchipudi, a professor and chair of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n\n“In my view, cats should be on the top of that list,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/04/03/2024-bird-flu-outbreak-what-to-know/73189473007/", "title": "Bird flu outbreak is an 'evolving situation.' Here's what to know about ...", "text": "Many Americans are brimming with questions after officials in Texas last week announced the state's first case of bird flu in a human.\n\nOn April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, after close contact with infected cows. The week prior, sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said.\n\nThe only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update April 1 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOfficials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves.\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"\n\nBut if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans.\n\nCDC says cases rising:What to know about meningococcal disease\n\nHow does bird flu spread?\n\nBird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.\n\nAvian flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, or mouth or inhale it into their lungs.\n\nPeople who have close contact or unprotected contact for long periods are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that leads to death.\n\nIn the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nOfficials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. The other species caught the virus directly from wild birds: cats.\n\nCornell researchers believe the virus was transmitted to Texas dairy cows through contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology.\n\nIn early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in the testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHow do humans get bird flu?\n\nIt's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease.\n\nThere remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases, officials said.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy:Weight-loss drugs cost $1,000 a month but less than $25 to make. Why do we pay so much?\n\nDo eggs carry bird flu? What about dairy products?\n\nFood production officials have been taking steps to prevent the distribution of milk or eggs from infected animals. Cooked eggs and pasteurized milk, in general, should be safe for consumers.\n\nLast week, the largest U.S. chicken egg supplier reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nThere isn't as simple of a solution to reduce the risk of bird flu since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell.\n\nAmong dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have microorganisms dangerous to human health.\n\nDr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian, said it’s important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, whereas this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren’t getting as sick.\n\nShe said people are at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with intensive dairy production.\n\nThe spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms.\n\n“If that’s the worst we see, then that’s good,” she said. “But we don’t yet know.\"\n\nHow can bird flu be stopped?\n\nThe latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nDetwiler believes consumers should be proactive if they have concerns about outbreaks.\n\n\"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\"\n\nOther ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. This includes contact with animal feces, waste, or materials contaminated by animals suspected or confirmed with bird flu.\n\nPeople working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment such as face masks – ideally approved particulate respirators such as N95 masks, as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. Additionally, they should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head covers or hair covers.\n\nPeople who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 10 days after the exposure.

Farmed mink can catch it, as can polar bears and seals.\n\nBird flu is also spreading through U.S. dairies. Infected cows can share it when moved to other farms, and sharing milking machines can also help spread the virus.\n\nThe CDC is working on more genome sequencing of samples from the Louisiana patient. This is the first case documented based on exposure to a backyard flock with sick and dead animals.\n\nWhere in Mississippi has bird flu been confirmed in backyard or commercial poultry?\n\nAccording to MBAH samples from the newest infected flock were \"rested at the Mississippi Veterinary Research & Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.\"\n\nBird flu has been found in \"U.S. wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard or hobbyist flocks beginning in January 2022,\" per the CDC.\n\nAccording to the USDA, \"Wild birds can be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, potentially exposing domestic poultry to the virus.\"\n\n\"If you have poultry, your birds can get bird flu if they have contact with infected wild birds or share food, water sources, and other environments with them,\" per DHHS.\n\nThe Mississippi State University Extension Office said HPAI usually kills 95% to all of an infected flock, but low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) might only cause minor illness.\n\nAt least 123,689,426 birds have been affected since 2016 across the U.S., and initial testing show these are \" HPAI A(H5N1) viruses from clade 2.3.4.4,\" according to the CDC. Only one state hasn't been affected, and there have been more than 1,300 reported outbreaks.\n\nIn Mississippi, the tracker shows bird flu was confirmed in the following counties:\n\nCopiah.\n\nLawrence.\n\nLeake.\n\nLowndes.\n\nMonroe.\n\nMost Mississippi outbreaks were in 2022 and 2023. Three were at single households and affected 50 or fewer birds. In February 2023, 89,800 poultry animals were in an outbreak in a Leake County commercial broiler production facility. In November 2022, 34,400 birds were in a outbreak at a Lawrence County commercial broiler breeder.\n\nWhat if I have dead, sick chickens?\n\n\"Avian influenza in birds can cause sudden death; lack of energy or appetite; decreased egg production;soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling or purple discoloration of head, eyelids, comb, hocks; nasaldischarge; coughing; sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea,\" MBAH said in a news release.\n\nMBAH put the poultry industry on alert Monday in light of the newly confirmed infection. People who keep poultry as a hobby are also encouraged to practice good biosecurity and be alert for signs of bird flu. They should report sickness and deaths via an online reporting form.\n\nIf you think something is wrong with a flock, the extension office encourages immediate action. Commercial producers should reach out their tech.

He’s always been messing with people and figuring things out before anyone else does.”\n\nFast forward 40-plus years and Swinney is on the cusp of his 50th birthday.\n\nAnd still messing with people.\n\nShowing up for team meetings wearing a pink sports coat.\n\nChanneling his inner Justin Timberlake while executing post-victory dances in the locker room.\n\nPranking fellow coaches with exploding golf balls.\n\nWinning games by an average margin of 35 points in what was supposed to be a “rebuilding” year, at least defensively.\n\nSwinney is in his 11th full season as Clemson’s head football coach and already has no equals. He has won 127 games and lost only 30, guided the Tigers to a school-record nine straight seasons of 10 or more victories and won two national titles.\n\nPlayers love him.\n\nFans adore him.\n\nHe’s the highest-paid coach in the nation and perhaps more importantly is worth every penny in the eyes of Clemson fans.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS:ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS:Analyzing the College Football Playoff rankings\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS:Major bowls get shuffled after unbeatens fall\n\nSwinney will celebrate his 50th birthday on Wednesday, although “celebrate” is a relative term. He’ll pause to enjoy a slice of his favorite cake – sour cream with cream cheese frosting and pecans – at the team’s weekly supper, but he won’t tarry long.\n\n“It’s crazy this time of year,” says Swinney’s wife, Kathleen. “We really can’t celebrate because he’s got to work. I think in the offseason he and I will celebrate.\"\n\nDabo and Kathleen have been married for 25 years, and this is how most of her husband’s birthdays have unfolded – put on hold until there’s an escape clause for a week or so after spring practice.\n\nThe days and weeks and years and birthdays have rolled by in a relentless procession.\n\n“It’s just amazing,” Kathleen says. “I can’t believe how time has clicked by, but I'm so proud of my husband and the amazing program he has built.”\n\nDabo at 10\n\nDabo Swinney first caught Kathleen Bassett’s eye at Valley Elementary School in Pelham, Alabama.\n\nHe was in second grade, she was in first, but the attraction was there from the get-go.\n\n“We were always just really great friends, from 7 years old on,” Kathleen said.\n\nThe friendship flourished, then was upgraded a few years later when both served on the school’s safety patrol and student council.\n\n“We had a dance and he asked me to go to that,” Kathleen said. “So I guess it was our first official date. I was nervous, but really excited.”\n\nAnd what does she remember about Dabo’s dancing skills?\n\n“It was just little slow dances,” Kathleen said. “Nothing quite like the scene it is today with him dancing in the locker room.”\n\nDabo and Kathleen maintained their friendship at Riverchase Middle School and eventually Pelham High, where Dabo was a multi-sport athlete for the Panthers.\n\nFor the junior-senior powderpuff football game, Dabo led a group of seniors who dressed up as the coaching staff, with Dabo playing the role of legendary Pelham head coach Billy Tohill.\n\n“It was really funny,” Morton said. “And looking back it was kind of prophetic that he took on that role.”\n\nAnother childhood friend, Norman Saia, said he was reminded time and again that Swinney was cut from a different cloth.\n\n“Even as a young kid, he was always the leader,” Saia said. “I was a year older than him and I never studied, but before we’d go to the gym and play he’d make me sit there and study. Even back then he was coaching and teaching.”\n\nDabo’s roaring 20s\n\nBy his 20th birthday, Dabo was a walk-on football player at the University of Alabama.\n\nHis birthday fell two days after the Crimson Tide defeated Southern Miss and a gunslinging quarterback named Brett Favre 37-14 to improve to 10-0 in their third and final season under Bill Curry.\n\nHis position coach? A young assistant named Tommy Bowden.\n\nSaia, who started his career at Jacksonville State, got a call from Swinney, who told him of his plan to walk on at Alabama.\n\n“He said he didn’t want to do it alone,” Saia said. “So we walked on together.”\n\nSaia was hit by a drunk driver after his sophomore season, breaking his pelvis and effectively ending his football career. But Swinney didn’t allow their friendship to end.\n\n“The winter after football season he would drive to Birmingham, come and get me and put me in his car and take me back to Pelham where we grew up and see whoever we could see,” Saia said. “He always had a great heart.”\n\nAt Alabama, Gene Stallings replaced Curry after the 1989 season and Stallings quickly developed an affinity for the hard-working Swinney.\n\n“He was just an average player,” Stallings said. “But he wanted to be a good player, and that was important to me.”\n\nStallings eventually put Swinney on scholarship and Dabo was a wide receiver on the Crimson Tide’s national championship team in 1992.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, Swinney joined Stallings’ staff as a graduate assistant, starting in the weight room and finally landing a gig as wide receivers coach in 1995.\n\n“Everything that he got he had to work for,” said Woody McCorvey, who was on Stallings’ staff at the time and today serves as Clemson’s associate athletic director for football administration. “It wasn’t like anything was given to him. Coach Stallings gave him an opportunity and he capitalized on it.”\n\nOne of the first things McCorvey noticed about Swinney was his meticulous note keeping.\n\n“He was copious about taking notes – same way he is today,” McCorvey said. “I mean, every time you see him he’s writing something down, and it has served him well.”\n\nDabo at 30-something\n\nSwinney ushered in his decade of the 30s in memorable fashion.\n\nHe was in his second season as wide receivers coach at Alabama when the Crimson Tide rolled into Auburn and defeated their archrival 28-17 on Swinney’s 30th birthday.\n\nAlabama would go on to pound Florida 34-7 in SEC championship game before losing to Michigan 35-34 in the Orange Bowl to cap a 10-3 season.\n\nBut Swinney’s days at Alabama came to an unceremonious end the following year when Mike DuBose, who had succeeded Stallings, was let go after a 3-8 season. Swinney left football for a while – not by choice, of course – and worked two years in real estate as a shopping center developer.\n\nHe was successful but unhappy, so when Bowden called to offer him a job coaching wide receivers at Clemson in 2003, Dabo jumped at the opportunity.\n\nIt would turn out to be the most fateful decision of his life.\n\nClemson was a successful program, and Swinney quickly became a popular figure among the players – even those players who played other positions, as then-athletic director Terry Don Phillips noticed on numerous occasions.\n\nWhen Bowden was relieved of his head coaching duties following a loss to Wake Forest midway through the 2008 season, Phillips tabbed Swinney to be the interim coach.\n\n“That didn’t surprise me at all,” said Chris Donnelly, a former teammate of Swinney’s at Alabama. “I knew that everybody loved him because of his personality and I knew that they needed someone who could hold the ship together for seven weeks. He was the right guy.”\n\nSwinney hit the ground running and the Tigers won four of their final six games, including a 31-14 decision against South Carolina that helped convince Phillips to remove the interim tag.\n\nSwinney was named Clemson’s head coach 11 days after his 39th birthday.\n\n“God put Dabo in this situation because he can handle it,” Kathleen said at the time.\n\nDabo’s fabulous 40s\n\nThe next year, on his 40th birthday, Swinney was busy preparing his 7-3 Clemson team to play Virginia the next day at Memorial Stadium. Clemson won 34-21, its sixth victory in a row en route to a 9-5 season. Five weeks later to the day, Swinney got his first bowl win as a head coach when Clemson beat Kentucky in the Music City Bowl, 21-13.\n\nDabo and Kathleen and their three sons celebrated Christmas with a tiny tree on a bedside stand in a hotel room in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe Tigers slipped to 6-7 the next season, after which Swinney boldy declared that the next decade would be the best in Clemson history.\n\nTurns out, he was right.\n\nClemson went 10-4 the next season and won the program’s first ACC title since 1991, launching a series of successes that show no signs of wavering.\n\nThe Tigers have not won less than 10 games in any season since.\n\nSwinney’s unparalleled success at Clemson has created quite a quandary for some of his former Alabama teammates, many of whom visit Swinney regularly and attend Clemson games.\n\n“I’m not gonna lie – I’m crimson in the blood,” Donnelly said. “I love Alabama, but I root for people.”\n\nThat goes a long way toward explaining why Donnelly’s son, Carson, is a walk-on safety for the Tigers and roommates with the Swinney’s middle son, Drew, who’s a wide receiver on the team.\n\n“The first two times Alabama and Clemson played, I looked at it like I couldn’t lose,” Donnelly said. “But last year, with my son on the team, I was decked out in orange.”\n\nDabo at 50\n\nAs Swinney turns 50, he’s likely too busy to pause and reflect for long.\n\nHe’s on the cusp of yet another ACC Championship, his team hasn’t lost since the final game of the 2017 season and is ranked No. 3 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings.\n\nHe celebrates every victory like it’s the first of his career.\n\nHis players are happy because they all get to play.\n\nHe lets offensive linemen score touchdowns and linebackers attempt PATs.\n\nYes, Swinney at 50 is much like Swinney at 10 – energized, happy-go-lucky and wearing a permanent grin.\n\n“Dabo has never changed,” Donnelly said. “One of the most astonishing things I remember about Dabo is he was always happy, always smiling, always upbeat – even at practice.\n\n“We’re in the middle of two-a-days at Alabama and we’re running and it’s 110 degrees and he’s smiling. I’m like, ‘What world do you live in? Can I live in your world for a little bit?’ ”\n\nIndeed, one gets the sense that it’s Dabo’s world and the Clemson fan base is just living in it.\n\nThe good thing is Swinney wants everybody to come along for the ride.\n\n“He’s always been the epitome of the glass is half full,” Donnelly said. “I always knew he’d be successful. If he decided to go into the military, he’d be five-star general. If he went into the business world, he’d be a CEO. If he chose politics, he’d be president.\n\n“But I knew he’d be a head coach one day. He’d been preparing for it his whole life.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/europe/prince-william-40th-birthday-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "title": "Prince William shines a light on homelessness to mark his 40th ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nPrince William has revealed why he swapped his royal garb for a red vendor jacket and took to the streets of London to sell The Big Issue magazine, which offers employment opportunities to people in poverty.\n\nAhead of the Duke of Cambridge celebrating his 40th birthday on Tuesday, he wrote a piece for the magazine detailing why he went undercover to sell issues to members of the public in support of the cause earlier this month.\n\n“I was 11 when I first visited a homeless shelter with my mother, who in her own inimitable style was determined to shine a light on an overlooked, misunderstood problem,” William wrote in a piece published Monday. “In the 30-odd years since, I’ve seen countless projects in this space grow from strength to strength, including charities of which I have had the honour of being Patron.”\n\nWilliam joined vendor Dave Martin, 60, in the capital to draw attention to the work of the publication, which is sold by rough sleepers and people facing poverty and homelessness in the UK, according to The Big Issue’s official website.\n\nWilliam sold copies of The Big Issue magazine to raise awareness of homelessness ahead of his 40th birthday. Andy Parsons/The Big Issue/Reuters\n\n“I wanted to experience the other side and see what it was like to be a Big Issue vendor. My time was truly eye opening,” William wrote. “And while I may seem like one of the most unlikely advocates for this cause, I have always believed in using my platform to help tell those stories and to bring attention and action to those who are struggling. I plan to do that now I’m turning 40, even more than I have in the past.”\n\nThe prince added that he intended to “shine a spotlight on this solvable issue not just today, but in the months and years to come.”\n\nWilliam sold the magazine with Martin on Rochester Row, close to Victoria in London, just a few days after Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\n\nWhen William asked Martin what The Big Issue had done for him, he said: “It got me off the street. Gave me respect. I was begging at the time. Another vendor said I could be doing something a lot better and took me along to The Big Issue office.”\n\nWilliam described his time selling the magazine as \"truly eye opening.\" Andy Parsons/The Big Issue/Reuters\n\nVendors buy magazines for £1.50 ($1.84) and sell them for £3 ($3.68), keeping the proceeds. There are around 1,300 people working their way out of poverty by selling The Big Issue, according to the magazine’s official website.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the British royal family sent birthday wishes to William on social media on Tuesday.\n\nPrince Charles shared a series of photos of the father and son duo throughout the years on Twitter, with the caption: “Wishing The Duke of Cambridge a very happy 40th birthday!” One image was a black and white portrait of Charles holding a baby William, while another featured the two sitting in a cable car during a ski trip.\n\nSign up for CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/mark-giannotto/2019/05/06/jarvis-greer-memphis-sports-television-wmc/3619581002/", "title": "After 40 years on air, Jarvis Greer is a Memphis sports institution and ...", "text": "Jarvis Greer heard that familiar buzz work its way around the WMC-TV newsroom last week and looked up from his computer at 5:47 p.m. There was a tornado warning in Mississippi County, Arkansas, and, after all these years, he knew what that meant.\n\n“I can almost guarantee the weather is going to go long,” Greer said. “If they’re going to cut the time, they’re going to cut it from us.”\n\nAnd so, without needing to be told, Greer began to cut from his sports segment, which was only supposed to last 2 minutes, 15 seconds to start. A clip about Tim Howard smashing the guitar at a Memphis 901 FC soccer game would have to wait for the 10 p.m. broadcast.\n\nAs he did this, Greer smiled because it brought to mind a lesson his predecessor and mentor, legendary voice of the Tigers Jack Eaton, taught him long ago.\n\n“Jarvo, my lad, it’s never killed,” Greer said. “It’s just postponed.”\n\nGreer celebrated his 40th anniversary at WMC last week, a feat of durability and relevance that reminds us both of the rare connection he’s formed with television viewers here in Memphis and how rare this sort of accomplishment is becoming.\n\nBecause in an era of ESPN and social media, when sports highlights and scores are available on every smartphone, the power of the local sports anchor has been diminished and, in some cases, completely eliminated.\n\n“The 40-year sportscaster is becoming an endangered species. It’s a sad trend,” said Mark Danon, a media consultant and agent who spent 20 years working in local TV news. “It says something about the way he presents sports that he’s had that longevity.”\n\nJust last February, for instance, Glenn Carver left his role as sports director at WREG-TV after 34 years at the station. A month before that, FOX 13 Memphis got rid of sports anchors from its daily broadcasts altogether.\n\nSo it begs the question: Will we ever see someone like Jarvis Greer again?\n\nHow Jarvis Greer went from athlete to local TV\n\nGreer, 61, is a Memphis native who grew up when segregation and racial prejudice were widespread in this city, but he somehow grew up without ever allowing that to taint his enthusiasm and vigor for his hometown. He was a football star at Christian Brothers High School and then played defensive back at Memphis State.\n\nBut television always seemed to be in his future.\n\nAs a child, Greer used to create fake newscasts on his 8 mm Bell and Howell wind-up camera, send the film to Walgreens and wait a week to see what it looked like. On the bus back from road games at Memphis State, he would sit next to Eaton and pick his brain.\n\nSo in 1979, after graduating from Memphis State, he showed up at WMC’s Union Avenue office to work alongside Eaton. He started as a grip, lugging equipment, and eventually did “pretty much every job in here,” he said.\n\nGreer remembers his first on-air story, about the used car lots that once lined Lamar Avenue, \"was horrible,\" he said. \"But they let me do another one.\"\n\nAnd they ultimately allowed him to follow his passion – reporting on Memphis sports. For seven years, Greer served as the weekend sports anchor and Eaton’s primary backup. In 1991, when Eaton retired, Greer was elevated to his current role as sports director.\n\nBy that point, his enthusiastic on-air style and unabashed love of all things Memphis sports had been well-established.\n\n“I’m a fan like anybody else, and I hope that comes across,” Greer said. “I always look at it like there’s so much doom and gloom in the world. Hey man, let’s take a break. Let’s have some fun for a minute. One thing Jack always taught me is if you’re interested in it, people will be interested in it. If it looks like you’re just trying to pass the time, they’ll just click, change the channel. That kind of freed the inner me.”\n\nWhy Greer is 'an anomaly' in local TV\n\nThis means, seconds before you actually see Greer on camera each night, he’s probably playing air guitar or air drums to the WMC theme song and cracking up everyone else in the studio.\n\nIt means he’s known to make impromptu calls into local sports talk radio shows and has no qualms cheering for the local teams, whether it’s in his role on Memphis football radio broadcasts or as a Grizzlies season-ticket holder.\n\nIt means he usually says the first thing that comes to mind on air because he thinks about his segments as just “talking to your friends.”\n\nAll this helps explain why he’s lasted 40 years in Memphis.\n\nWhat you should appreciate most of all is this – a local sportscaster starting in his hometown market and never leaving – doesn’t happen very often. Certainly not anymore.\n\n“Jarvis is an anomaly,” said WMC lead anchor Joe Birch, who has been at the station 41 years. “Most of the people in our business are nomads ... but Jarvis and I have taken the road less traveled. We’ve stayed right here because we love our city, we love our community and we love our wives.”\n\nYes, Greer got married here in Memphis to Emily Greer, the chief administrative officer for ALSAC. He raised his children here and watched them both graduate from the University of Memphis. And last year, he became a grandparent of triplets here in Memphis.\n\nAlong the way, he’s been “the living embodiment of Memphis sports,” Birch said, and a reassuring presence during every major Memphis sports story of the past 40 years.\n\nSo will we ever see another Jarvis Greer? Maybe not.\n\nThat’s a product of the changing business he works in, but also because he’s never changed who he is.\n\n“I get to cover the people I want to cover, and I get to talk about the people I want to talk about,” Greer said as he walked out of the studio last week. “Why go anywhere else?”\n\nYou can reach Commercial Appeal columnist Mark Giannotto via email at mgiannotto@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter: @mgiannotto\n\nMore sports columns from The CA\n\nZ-Bo:Zach Randolph wants to keep playing in the NBA, but Moneybagg Yo might be his future\n\nTiger basketball:Memphis in May could belong to Penny Hardaway and the five-star prospects he's recruiting this year\n\nIn Memoriam:Johnny Neumann's legacy is about more than what he did or didn't accomplish in basketball", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/football/argentina-france-best-world-cup-final-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Argentina's win over France was the greatest World Cup final ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt seems only yesterday that Enner Valencia was swatting aside Qatar in the 2022 World Cup’s curtain raiser.\n\nAs the dust settles on an enthralling month of soccer action, fans have been treated to arguably one of the greatest ever World Cup tournaments in the sport’s history.\n\nIn fitting fashion, Sunday’s final exploded like a firework display to provide the ultimate conclusion to Qatar 2022.\n\nThis was a final that had superstar rivalries, penalties, iconic goals and goalkeeping masterclasses, culminating in Lionel Messi’s crowning as world champion after Argentina beat France on penalties.\n\nThe pièce de resistance, a moment that will live long in the memory like an impressionistic masterpiece, is that iconic image of Messi – lifted aloft on his teammates’ shoulders – with the World Cup trophy finally in his hands.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nThe clashing of two stars\n\nThis match had been billed as Kylian Mbappé vs. Messi – the 23-year-old French star ready to assume the mantle of the world’s greatest player from his 35-year-old Paris Saint-Germain teammate.\n\nMbappé was defending France’s 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, Messi was playing in his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which has eluded him for so long and which would enable him to match Diego Maradona’s achievement of winning the 1986 competition.\n\nThe opening 79 minutes was all about Messi. Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to La Albiceleste’s second.\n\nThen in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.\n\nMessi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.\n\nExcept it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.\n\nBoth Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.\n\nOver two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.\n\nMbappé sits on the bench at the end of the World Cup final. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nFrom the spot\n\nThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.\n\nSometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.\n\nMessi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.\n\nMbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumption.\n\nMbappé scores France's third goal against Argentina in the World Cup final. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.\n\nArgentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.\n\nIn Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.\n\nA penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.\n\nMartínez saves the penalty from Kingsley Coman of France in the World Cup final. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGreat goals\n\nWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.\n\nArgentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.\n\nArgentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.\n\nIt was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.\n\nAfter Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.\n\nUnselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 up.\n\nDi María celebrates after he scored Argentina's second goal against France in the World Cup final. Stefan Matzke/sampics/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.\n\nAfter his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.\n\nWith seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.\n\nThese are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nIt will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.\n\nOther great World Cup finals\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of competition for the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’\n\nIn 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, while four years later, West Germany provided another huge surprise, beating Hungary’s Magical Magyars, earning the country its first World Cup title.\n\nGeoff Hurst scored the first World Cup final hat-trick in the 1966 final between England and West Germany. Hurst’s second goal is still talked about 56 years later – had the ball crossed the line?

But it's still a significant landmark for this facility.\"\n\nMore:Rory McIlroy returns to No. 17, reflects on a banner season\n\nMore:Players Championship Impact is wide, deep\n\nMore:John Tucker’s love of golf, community helped return the PGA Tour to the First Coast\n\nRegardless of how the PGA Tour and TPC Sawgrass has chosen to observe the milestone, there's more than enough history for some serious reflection on a time period that has seen The Players Championship become one of the biggest golf events in the world, partly because it's been played on the Stadium Course, architect Pete Dye's crowning achievement.\n\n\"I look at the PGA Tour today and where we are, for a lot of reasons,\" said Tour commissioner Jay Monahan. \"But the TPC Sawgrass would be right there at the top of the list.\"\n\nThe only formal celebration was a small dinner and a panel discussion last week for media with former Tour commissioner Deane Beman, former TPC Sawgrass project manager Vernon Kelly, PGA Tour Properties CEO Jim Triola and PGA Tour vice-president of design services Steve Wenzloff.\n\nThere, for 90 minutes, they swapped stories of the challenge of obtaining the land, building the course, making it a suitable venue for the best players in the world, extending the TPC brand out to more than 30 facilities and what it's meant to the big picture for the Tour and the First Coast.\n\nIt's a dream that had modest beginnings, rooted in Beman's contention that golf fans should be able to watch the sport in the same manner as football and baseball fans, in a stadium, with unobstructed views of the competition?\n\nBeman brought his dream of stadium golf, a permanent home for The Players and the PGA Tour to fruition through a series of astute and bold moves in the late 1970s.\n\nHe knew that Dye's course, starring the Island Green at the par-3 17th hole, would stand the test of time.\n\nWhat surprises him is the total package, 40 years later: a second course, Dye's Valley, a stately new clubhouse, a world-class practice facility, a sleek, modern PGA Tour headquarters building that will open in January and a tournament that is the Tour's crown jewel event, won 17 times by members of the World Golf Hall of Fame and viewed by an international TV audience in 222 countries.\n\n\"Where it is today is a lot better than where we started,\" Beman said.\n\nAnd it all began with a tract of 417 acres of swampland and snakes that was purchased for $1 and carved into 18 holes by (some said mad) a genius.\n\nCold, rainy beginning\n\nThe first official shots on the Stadium Course were struck on Oct. 24, 1980, by a group of area golf influencers such as past Greater Jacksonville Open chairmen John Tucker and Wes Paxson Sr., Beman, and PGA Tour players Mark McCumber (a Jacksonville native whose family company was the original contractor to build the course), Jerry Pate and Hale Irwin.\n\nIt was a bit of foreshadowing that Pate would go on to win the first Players contested at the Stadium Course in 1982 and McCumber would be the first player with First Coast ties to win the tournament in 1988.\n\nDye would later say, \"nothing was easy about building that course,\" referring to the swampy land, parts of which were below sea level, thick stands of pine and mangrove and the usual cast of Florida characters: rattlesnakes, moccasins and alligators.\n\nAnd nothing was easy about playing golf on the first day. It was unseasonably cold and rain came down in sheets. The groups plowed forward through 18 holes, sometimes grabbing huge palm fronds that had blown down to shelter their heads.\n\n\"It was brutal,\" McCumber said. \"It was so cold and so wet that all we could do was laugh about it.\"\n\nLater, as the participants dried out over drinks in the clubhouse, Beman noted: \"when the first golf shots were struck in Scotland [600 years before when the game was invented], it was probably on a day like this.\"\n\nAn attempt was made to shoot some celebratory fireworks off after Beman's speech. The rain was coming down so hard that they looked more like wet colors in the sky, somewhat akin to the brightly-hued suds in modern car washes.\n\n\"It was a bit surreal,\" said Kelly. \"It was more like psychedelic colors than fireworks.\"\n\nBut the course, fast-tracked from groundbreaking to completion in 11 months, was done.\n\nHistory was soon to follow. Pate won 18 months later, threw Beman and Dye into the pond adjacent to the 18th green, then jumped in after them.\n\nWorld No. 1-ranked Rory McIlroy captured The Players 37 years later and said \"Very proud, very honored, to call myself Players champion.\"\n\nPate and McIlroy bookended a era in which Tiger Woods, Davis Love III, Fred Couples, Phil Mickelson, Greg Norman, Nick Price and Sandy Lyle, World Golf Hall of Fame members all, have had the same feeling.\n\nStadium golf dismissed at first\n\nBeman, one of a handful of men who had won the U.S. and British Amateurs and who was carving out a solid PGA Tour career (he won four times in five years) had the idea of stadium golf in the mid-1960s after he noticed how difficult it was for many golf fans to get a good view of the action.\n\nHe didn't take it to the PGA Tour. Instead, he went to the United States Golf Association, carrying some concepts sketched out by Washington D.C. golf architect Ed Ault. Beman made his pitch to the rule-makers of the sport: build a half dozen stadium courses and take their championships there and use the courses as vast outdoor turfgrass laboratories for its Green Section.\n\nBeman estimated that the USGA higher-ups gave him all of about 10 minutes before giving a terse verdict.\n\n\"They thought it was the worst idea they ever heard,\" Beman said.\n\nThe concept was shelved and Beman got on with playing the sport professionally and dabbling in a myriad of business interests that included golf-course architecture, real estate and insurance.\n\nBut injuries curtailed his playing career and he became more interested in the business end of the Tour -- namely, how could it grow beyond the attention paid to its stars such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Raymond Floyd and Lee Trevino.\n\nCompounding that was the fact that the game's biggest stars were sure to come together only four times a year, at the Masters, U.S. Open, PGA Championship and British Open -- none of which were operated by the Tour.\n\n\"We were a minor sport with major stars,\" Beman once said, referring to the top-heavy hierarchy. \"Bowling had more TV time and revenue.\"\n\nThe Tour's biggest stars then made a move and eventually led to Beman's future -- and their own.\n\nAt the time the PGA Tour was simply the playing division of the PGA of America. Nicklaus and Palmer, leading a group of elite players who didn't believe they should have to take classes on how to sell sweaters or run a member-guest, led a breakaway movement and poached Dey from the USGA in 1968 to be the first commissioner.\n\nDey served for five years and his biggest single achievement was to create The Players Championship, which began in 1974 and rotated venues at Fort Worth, Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nDey retired and the Tour players turned to Beman, who by then had cultivated a reputation for his business acumen as much as his short-game skills.\n\nProfessional golf was about to be turned on its head.\n\nFirst Coast welcomes Tour, Players\n\nWhen Beman was first named commissioner he wanted Tour headquarters to be in a warm-weather locale, with its own golf course, where The Players would be staged every year.\n\nIt was the Augusta National model for the Masters, where Beman had played 14 times. He knew Florida was a natural location and targeted March as the date for The Players.\n\n\"We thought if we could move it to winter in Florida, it would be the first important event of the year,\" he said.\n\nBut where?\n\nOne day, in 1976, when Beman was at the Greater Jacksonville Open at Deerwood, he wanted to play golf with his son. He found GJO chairman Fred Robbins, who steered him to the Sawgrass Country Club in Ponte Vedra -- which at the time was in financial distress and was partially owned by three banks that had taken over the course in receivership.\n\nBeman said it took four holes to become enamored of the Ed Seay design.\n\n\"I was shocked the golf course was in any difficulty,\" he said. \"It was a great golf course.\"\n\nBeman first got a commitment from GJO officials to morph their event in The Players. As an incentive, Beman said his plan for making all PGA Tour events not-for-profit would enable the GJO to double its charitable donations in one year from $50,000 to $100,000.\n\nBeman offered the banks holding the note on Sawgrass $1.8 million to buy the property. The PGA Tour Policy Board balked at the purchase until they could see the results of the a Players Championship at Sawgrass.\n\nBeman then got a shock after Mark Hayes won the first Players on the First Coast in 1977 -- Arvida swooped in and bought Sawgrass.\n\nBeman then tried to buy the course from Arvida. His answer was curt as an Arvida official told him, more or less, \"you can't afford it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what Arvida paid,\" Beman said. \"My guess is they paid a decent price for it.\"\n\nBeman was back to square one.\n\nA swamp for $1\n\nBeman began investigating area properties. He rented a helicopter and got aerial views of land in Amelia Island, Clay County, one tract in Duval just north of where the current Pablo Creek Club sits and another 8 miles south of Ponte Vedra along the Guano River.\n\nHe even scouted out a property on Laurel Island in South Georgia.\n\nBeman then got wind of a 5,000-acre property across A1A from the Sawgrass Country Club owned by developers Paul and Jerome Fletcher. They were in a bit of a financial bind and their creditors urged them to sell some of the property.\n\nBeman, looking at the big picture for the future of Ponte Vedra, told the Fletchers of his grand plan -- the next great golf tournament, a signature course and PGA Tour headquarters, all in one spot, which would jump-start development for everyone.\n\n\"There wasn't much in Ponte Vedra back then,\" said Jim McCumber, whose family was developing the Ravines in Middleburg at the time. \"A1A was single-lane and residential developers didn't really want to touch that land. It was just way to difficult to clear.\"\n\nThe Fletchers sold 417 acres to the Tour for $1 -- with the belief that the value of the rest of their land would soar, making it more affordable to develop.\n\nDriving down A1A in present-day Ponte Vedra proves it was a win-win.\n\n\"It was pretty visionary on both sides,\" Monahan said.\n\nBeman got another bonus: he hired Kelly away from the Fletchers to be his project manager.\n\nNext came the issue of raising money to build the course. PGA Tour marketing director Bob Dickson, a former Tour player, sold 50 local memberships at $20,000 each, and 3,000 affiliate memberships at $50.\n\nThat gave them $1.15 million. Kelly then had a friend who ran a savings and loan in Daytona Beach, who gave the Tour a non-recourse loan for $4.5 million.\n\nThe nearly $6 million was enough to build the course and the clubhouse.\n\n\"The Tour didn't spend a nickel to build that course,\" Beman says with pride.\n\nDye enters the picture\n\nThe issue now became how to turn the land, some of which sat below sea level (because building A1A cut off the natural drainage to the ocean), into a golf course\n\nThe first contractor the Tour hired was Masters Links, the golf-course construction arm of the McCumber's business. Jim McCumber said he took one look at the property and brought in Hubert Woodruff, who ran a company that specialized in clearing difficult tracts of land.\n\n\"It really was a beautiful property,\" Jim McCumber said. \"The trees out there were just magnificent. But it was brutal to clear everything out. If it wasn't for the determination that Deane Beman and Pete Dye had, I'm not sure it would have ever gotten done.\"\n\nMcCumber said it wasn't unusual to park a tractor at the end of a day on what appeared to be high ground, then return the next day to see that heavy rain overnight had left the vehicle underwater.\n\nDye said more than once that he almost gave up. The McCumbers then turned the project over to Woodruff and Kelly because Mark had earned his PGA Tour card and they wanted to avoid the conflict of interest of a Tour player having a financial stake in building the Tour's signature course.\n\nFrom then on, it was a combination of Woodruff's expertise and the doggedness of Beman and Dye to see the project through.\n\nDye didn't have a degree in engineering or landscape architecture, but he had a knack for improving drainage and after getting a handle on the flooding, he began to sculpt his masterpiece -- crowned by the par-3 17th hole, which went from being a 170-yard par-3 with a lake to one side to a 137-yard with an island green.\n\nBeman said he won an important argument with Dye: after deciding to make it an Island Green, Dye still wanted No. 17 to be about 170 yards.\n\n\"He wanted the tee over to the east and back where a mound was and I wouldn't let him have it. Thank God,\" Beman said. \"It would not be the most famous hole in golf. It would be the most violently-hated golf hole.\"\n\nIt took 17 months of prepping and manicuring to get the course ready for its first close-up: the 1982 Players. A group of Tour players pressed for some changes after that, softening the undulations of the greens, getting rid of some of Dye's beloved pot bunkers and adding some mounds as landmarks to \"turn the ball on\" -- aiming points for cuts or draws.\n\nBeman said the players had a point about the greens -- and that was after he ordered Dye to take out some undulations before the course opened.\n\nBeman said if pros thought the greens were too severe when The Players began, they should have seen them when they were first grassed.\n\n\"They were too severe for the shots required to play them,\" Beman said. \"Golf is not fair in the first place but you can't have unfair greens to play an unfair game.\"\n\nThe Stadium Course has undergone four renovations since then, The Players moved to May for 12 years and is now back in March.\n\nBeman wonders if too much fight has been taken out of the course.\n\n\"The greens have been rebuilt four times and they probably were better after three times,\" he said. \"I think they're just a little too receptive for the length of the golf course. If the modern golf ball weren't so forgiving this would be a super challenging course, one of the most challenging anywhere, ever.\"\n\nThe TPC impact\n\nThe 2019 Players Championship was estimated to have brought $51 million in economic impact to the First Coast. Proceeds from the tournament raised $9.5 million in charity, which pushed the total since the first Players on the First Coast in 1977 to more than $100 million.\n\nThe purse is the richest in golf at $15 million ($2.7 million for the winner) and it's a must-play for the best in the world. Attendance routinely tops 200,000 for the week.\n\nThe TPC Sawgrass employs more than 300 people, and the PGA Tour more than 3,000. With the TPC Sawgrass ranked among the top golf destinations in the U.S. by publications such as Golf Digest (ninth among resort courses) and Golfweek (10th), it has fueled golf-related travel to the First Coast that resulted in 547,757 rounds and 142,417 room nights.\n\nDave Reese, the executive director of Florida's First Coast of Golf, which promotes golf-related tourism to the area, was asked what the landscape of the sport in the area would be like if Beman had not brought in the PGA Tour and The Players, and built the TPC Sawgrass.\n\n\"I'd rather not think about that,\" he said. \"The TPC Sawgrass is the crown jewel of golf facilities in this area. The Players Championship gives us unbelievable worldwide exposure and the combination of the TPC Sawgrass and the PGA Tour has brought thousands of jobs to this area.\"\n\nThe TPC Sawgrass has also become a worldwide bucket list trip for golfers who want to stand on the 17th tee and take their best -- or worst -- shots.\n\nAs a resort facility, anyone can play it, even if it does cost in excess of $300.\n\n\"It's an incredible golf experience and people save money for years to make the trip,\" McCumber said. \"I'm very thankful the Tour did not make the course private.\"\n\nAnd since the new clubhouse was built in 2007, visitors are allowed to take free tours, conducted by volunteers known as the TPC Sawgrass \"Storytellers,\" to see the many artifacts detailing the history of the TPC Sawgrass and The Players.\n\nThey can even get a quick trip on a golf cart to see No. 17.\n\nMonahan said the TPC Sawgrass and The Players are the models for the entire Tour.\n\n\"As we build all of our tournaments around the country and the world, the impact of Deane's vision is felt every single day,\" Monahan said. \"It sets a tone that we continue to try to live up to, follow and extend.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/11/paris-olympics-live-results/74191216007/", "title": "Olympics highlights: Closing ceremony, Tom Cruise and more", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe final day of the 2024 Paris Olympics was highlighted by the U.S. women’s basketball team beating France for its eighth consecutive gold medal.

Cruise did not disappoint.\n\nCruise rappelled down Stade de France into a crowd of athletes, who all met him with high-fives. Cruise then made his way to the stage to take the Olympic flag from Simone Biles and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. In classic Tom Cruise fashion, he then hopped on a motorcycle and rode out of the stadium and onto a plane.\n\nThe plane went straight to Los Angeles, and viewers were treated to the 62-year-old movie star skydiving onto the Hollywood sign, altering the two O's in Hollywood into the Olympic rings. The flag was then carried throughout LA, through iconic venues such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Long Beach, where the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre were waiting to offer a mini-concert. — Jon Hoefling\n\nSimone Biles shows at closing ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Simone Biles made a surprise appearance at the closing ceremony, playing a part in the passing of the Olympic flag from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nBiles stood with Bass while H.E.R. played the national anthem.

It is located just north of Paris in Saint-Denis. It's where the athletics events took place, as well as rugby sevens. It has a seating capacity of about 80,000, making it the largest stadium in France. Tonight every single one appears to be taken. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nLos Angeles 2028 update\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and LA28 Olympic Games chair Casey Wasserman, who are both here tonight, told reporters on Saturday that while the Paris Games have been \"authentically French,\" the 2028 Games will be \"authentically Los Angeles.\" The jury's out on that for another four years but Wasserman said this meant tapping into LA's music, fashion, culture and of course movies pedigree.\n\n\"We don't have an Eiffel Tower. We do have a Hollywood sign,\" said Wasserman. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nPhoenix, Kavinsky bring the party to closing ceremony\n\nThe first of many musicians to come onto stage for these closing ceremonies was Phoenix, a French indie band from Versailles. The group played their 2009 hit song \"Lisztomania\" from their fourth album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix was followed by French musician Kavinsky, who played his 2010 single Nightcall. Phoenix and Nightcall combined for a three-song set to entertain the crowd, and it was quite a show for such a short set. — Jon Hoefling\n\nAthletes rush the stage\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Athletes from several nations, including Team USA athletes, rushed the stage, albeit in a somewhat orderly fashion. They seemed to be joining performers who ran out of tunnels onto the stage.\n\nBut then broadcast across the stadium was this message in English: \"Please don’t stand on the stage.

But perhaps you noticed he, amazingly, was seated and playing a piano while suspended vertically in the air. Because the stadium was dark, it was challenging to notice this in person.\n\nThe hymn was discovered in the ruins of Delphi and was first performed in modern times to celebrate the 1894 revival of the Olympics two years later. The ancient score is in the Louvre. — Michelle Martinelli\n\n'The Golden Voyager' hits the stage at closing ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The stadium went dark, save for people’s phone flashlights and dramatic periodic flashing lights on the stage. The idea was to transport viewers to another world that is dark, deserted and mysterious, opening the door for the arrival of The Golden Voyager.\n\nCovered in golden sparkles and lowered down into the stadium, The Golden Voyager was inspired by elements of French history, including the Spirit of the Bastille, the Génie de la Liberté — a 1836 bronze-gilded statue signifying liberty by Auguste Dumont — and video games and science fiction.\n\nThe Golden Voyager character is also a nod to the Voyager Golden Record, which the Voyager spacecraft launched into the void in 1977 \"containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth\", should other spacefarers find it, according to NASA. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWomen's marathon medal ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The women’s marathon was one of the last events at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday morning, and the three medalists received their hardware at the closing ceremony: Netherlands’ gold medalist Sifan Hassan, Ethiopia’s silver medalist Tigst Assefa and Kenya’s bronze medalist Hellen Obiri. The crowd roared when Hassan was introduced.\n\nThe ceremony also paid video tribute to the Marathon Pour Tous, or the Marathon For All — a public event where people ran parts or the whole course on Saturday night. There were 20,024 participants registered.\n\nThe marathon route was inspired by the legendary Women’s March of 1789, where Parisians revolted over King Louis XVI’s apathy toward a flour shortage. They marched from through Paris to Versailles to bring the king back to the city in a moment the French remember for its defense of human rights and freedom. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWhat's in the boxes Olympic medalists receive?\n\nEach Olympic medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics also receives a box while they're standing on the podium, but what's inside?\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, it's the official poster for this year's Games. French artist Ugo Gattoni designed this year's posters over several months of work.\n\nRead more on what medalists have received this Olympics from Jordan Mendoza.\n\nKatie Ledecky and Nick Mead represent the U.S. as flag bearers\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Katie Ledecky doesn’t usually get to attend the Olympics opening ceremony because of her swimming schedule, but Sunday night, she was one of Team USA’s flag bearers at the closing ceremony, joined by rower Nick Mead.\n\nWhen she found out she was chosen as the flag bearer, Ledecky teared up when fellow 1,500 freestyle Olympic champion Bobby Finke delivered the news.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, Ledecky and Mead entered with all the nations’ flag bearers, donning their vintage NASCAR-esque Ralph Lauren outfits. They both looked excited walking around the stage at the booming stadium.\n\nMead, a 29-year-old first-time Olympian, was part of the men’s four team that won gold for the U.S. for the first time since the 1960 Olympics.\n\nWith 14 total medals, Ledecky, a 27-year-old four-time Olympian, is the most decorated American woman at the Olympics in any sport and the most decorated woman in swimming of all time. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nFlag bearers' procession into the Stade de France begins\n\nFollowing tradition, Greece leads the procession of all nations that participated in this year's Olympics into the arena.

He carried the lantern out of the Jardin des Tuileries and began his procession to bring the flame to the Stade de France. — Jack McKessy\n\nClosing ceremony begins with musical performance\n\nThe closing ceremony festivities began in front of the 2024 Paris Olympics' Olympic torch in the Jardin des Tuileries. French singer Zaho de Sagazan and the Choir of the Haendel-Hendrix Academy treated spectators to a rendition of \"Sous le ciel de Paris.\" — Jack McKessy\n\nCasey Wasserman on the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nThe chairman of the LA28 Organizing Committee sat down with NBC's Mike Tirico to discuss what to expect in four years' time, when the Olympics return to the U.S. for the first time since 1996. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhat is Team USA's closing ceremony outfit?\n\nAs in the opening ceremony, Ralph Lauren is the designer of Team USA's closing ceremony outfits.

She was drafted by the Chicago Sky but started playing overseas full time after the 2022 season.\n\nWilliams is from the United States but is eligible to play for France in the Olympics due to her mother, Therese, being from the host country of this year's Olympic Games. Williams also competed in the Tokyo Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the last competition. — Austin Curtright\n\nA'ja Wilson had NSFW answer to describe Kahleah Copper's performance\n\nKahleah Copper played a huge role for Team USA, coming off the bench to score 10 of her 12 points in the fourth quarter. Copper sank two crucial free throws with 3.9 seconds left that enabled the Americans to withstand Williams' buzzer beater.\n\nWhen asked for one word to describe the performance of Copper, Wilson gave a two-word term of endearment to describe the Phoenix Mercury All-Star guard.\n\n\"That (expletive)!\" Wilson said before giving a look into the camera that let the rest of the world know they were sleeping on Copper's skills. — Scooby Axson\n\nUSA women's hoops hang on for eighth consecutive gold\n\nWith the U.S. clinging to a 62-59 lead, Breanna Stewart got a fingertip on France’s 3 attempt, a huge defensive play with 20 seconds to go. At the other end, A'Ja Wilson hit one of two free throws to make it a two possession game.\n\nFrance’s Gabby Williams hit a shot at the buzzer but the forward wasn’t behind the 3-point line when it left her hand, leaving France short of tying the game and leaving the U.S. with a one-point victory, 67-66. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women hold 3-point lead with less than a minute left\n\nAfter Gabby Williams hit a long 2 for France with about 1:30 left, Kahleah Cooper answered with a layup out of the timeout to give the Americans a 62-59 lead with 54 seconds left. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women's hoops reclaims lead at end of 3Q\n\nThe national emergency appears to be over — for now. A’ja Wilson is getting ticked off, and that’s usually when the Americans start rolling. Wilson is up to four blocks (it feels like more) and dominated the third quarter defensively when the U.S. really needed it. She’s got 14 points and 12 rebounds. Two nice Sabrina Ionescu-to-Napheesa Collier baskets also helped the Americans get back into it after trailing by 10. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nFrance starts second half with surge\n\nA lot of people thought the U.S. would have a cakewalk to its eighth consecutive gold. France has other ideas. After an 8-0 run that gave the French a 33-25 lead to open the second half, the U.S. needed a timeout to talk things over. This crowd is only going to get louder. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nEvacuation takes place near Eiffel Tower\n\nFrench police briefly evacuated the area around the Eiffel Tower on Sunday after there were reports a man attempted to climb the 1,083-foot structure. The incident, reported by the Associated Press and in unverified eyewitness posts on social media, took place just hours before the Olympic closing ceremony was due to get underway. The shirtless man was spotted just above the Olympic rings that decorate the second section of Paris' famous landmark, the city's tallest building. The Eiffel Tower was a centerpiece of the opening ceremony. A purpose-built stadium directly in front of it hosted beach volleyball events. Blind football events will be played there during the Paralympics. The tower is not part of the closing ceremony. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS women's hoops tied with France at halftime\n\nThe women's basketball gold medal game is all tied up at the half after a crucial tip-in from Team USA’s Napheesa Collier just before the buzzer.\n\nReal talk: That half was ugly. The U.S. shot 29%, France shot 28% and the teams combined for 19 total turnovers. A’ja Wilson has six points but is just 2-of-9 from the field, while Stewart is 1-of-6 with five points. Wilson and Collier have nine rebounds each. Gabby Williams leads France with eight points.\n\nThe U.S. looks sloppy and disjointed and if it wants to keep the streak of seven-gold-medals-in-a-row-and-counting going, the Americans going to need to clean up a lot in the second half. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nSifan Hassan's Olympic feat arguably greatest in Summer Games history\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan and Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa tangled. They jostled. They were one false move away from taking each other out. Then, in the blink of an eye, Hassan was gone; a blur of Netherlands orange leaving Assefa behind and streaking to the gold medal. And when she crossed the wire in an Olympic record 2 hours, 22 minutes and 55 seconds, there was just one question left.\n\nHow is it possible for a human to do this?\n\nRead Dan Wolken's column on the extraordinary performance in the women's Olympic marathon.\n\nUSA men’s water polo wins bronze in shootout\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA men’s water polo were victorious in a thrilling 11-8 bronze-medal match that ended in a shootout against historical powerhouse Hungary on Sunday to win its first Olympic medal since 2008.\n\nThe American’s not only won the match and bronze medal, but they also shut out Hungary in the shootout, 3-0, at París La Défense Arena.\n\nUSA goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg – who stood on his head, especially in the final minutes and was spectacular in the shootout – made 16 saves on 24 shots, while American captain Ben Hallock led the team in scoring with two goals.\n\nRead more on Weinberg from Michelle Martinelli.\n\nAmerican cyclist takes gold in women's Omnium\n\nAmerican Jennifer Valente won her second consecutive gold medal in women’s Omnium cycling at the National Velodrome on Sunday.\n\nValente totaled 144 points, edging Poland’s Daria Pikulik (silver) and New Zealand’s Ally Wollaston (bronze). Omnium consists of four races (scratch race, tempo race, elimination and points), and points are awarded for each race. Valente won the 2022 and 2023 world championship in Omnium.\n\n\"It’s been a really long week of racing. I raced (team pursuit) qualifying over a week ago, and we had some really good performances, so to pull it off on the last day, I'm really excited,\" Valante said.\n\nValente, who won the event three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, was also part of the squad that won gold in team pursuit in Paris. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA women's hoops goes for eighth consecutive gold\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team gets to bring down the curtain on the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn the final event of these Games, the United States plays France with an eighth consecutive gold medal on the line. The Americans have mostly cruised through this Olympics tournaments, with each of their five wins coming by double digits, and three coming by 19 or more points. A'ja Wilson (18.2 points per game) and Breanna Stewart (18.0) have been leading the way, with Wilson also leading the team in rebounds (9.6), blocks (2.4) and steals (1.6).\n\nFollow along for updates and highlights.\n\nIOC has precedent to give two bronzes for gymnastics floor routine\n\nIn stripping Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal, the International Olympic Committee is not following the precedent it set for itself in the most publicized double-medal controversy in Olympic history.\n\nAt the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, in what became known as the French judge scandal, the IOC gave out two gold medals – to Canada and Russia – rather than take the gold medal from the Russian pairs skaters nearly a week after they received it, as it should have.\n\nRead more from Christine Brennan.\n\nItaly beats USA for gold medal in women's volleyball\n\nPARIS — The repeat dream is over for the U.S. women’s volleyball. Italy swept the Americans (25-18, 25-20, 25-17) in a match that lasted 81 minutes to deny the USA a second consecutive gold medal.\n\nItaly’s opposite hitter Paola Egonu supplied the bulk of her team’s attack, as she went off for 22 kills and was by far the best player on the court.\n\nJordan Thompson led the Americans with eight attack points. Italy finished with seven aces – five coming in the third set. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nItaly takes two-set lead over USA in women's volleyball\n\nPARIS — The teams traded points through the first part of the second set, but Italy pulled away during the middle portions and took the frame, 25-20.

The Americans could not navigate Italy’s block, and Italy finished with four block points in the frame.\n\nU.S. coach Karch Kiraly burned both timeouts by the time his team trailed 12-6. That deficit turned into 14-7. The Americans battled to 18-15 but were unable to overcome the rest of the margin.\n\nMeanwhile, the fans got loud for Italy.\n\n\"It-a-lia!

After a little bit of a shove between them, Hassan took the lead and pulled away for a three-second margin of victory. — Dan Wolken\n\nWomen's marathon result under review after protest\n\nPARIS — The result of the women's marathon is still under review after a protest from second-place finisher Tigst Assefa of Ethopia against the winner Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.\n\nJust a couple hundred yards from the finish line, the two competitors appeared to bump as Hassan tried to break through an opening inside of Assefa near the fence.\n\nAfter a little bit of a shove between them, Hassan took the lead and pulled away for a three-second margin of victory.\n\nRace officials informed the media that the medal ceremony and press conferences would be delayed until a decision is made whether to change the finish. — Dan Wolken\n\nPARIS — U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles will be required to return the individual bronze medal she received at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced Sunday morning.\n\nThe news comes less than 24 hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the judging panel for the women's floor exercise final made a mistake in granting an inquiry filed by Chiles' coaches, which moved the American gymnast into medal position. The Romanian Gymnastics Federation had challenged the validity of that move, saying it was filed four seconds beyond the deadline by which any inquiries had to be submitted.\n\nThe IOC said in a statement that it will reallocate the bronze medal to Romania's Ana Barbosu. — Nancy Armour and Tom Schad\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan wins women's marathon\n\nSifan Hassan — who won the bronze medal in both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter race — completed an incredible 2024 Paris Olympics by winning the women's marathon on Sunday, finishing in an Olympic record time of 2:22:55.\n\nIt required a late sprint to the finish for the track star, who out-paced Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa to the finish line of the 26.2-mile race. Assefa finished three seconds behind Hassan to win silver. Kenya's Hellen Obiri won the bronze.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm finishes 12th in women's marathon\n\nPARIS — Near the halfway point of the women’s marathon on Sunday, American Dakotah Lindwurm found herself in the lead. It was a scenario the former hockey player from Minnesota, ranked No. 138 in the world, could have never imagined.\n\n“I looked up and said, ‘God, you’re crazy – I can’t believe I’m at the front of the Olympic marathon right now,’” she said. “But you’ve got to put yourself in that position if you want to run well, and I’m not afraid to take the lead. I never have been, and it was fun.”\n\nThough it was a temporary thrill, Lindwurm surpassed all expectations by finishing 12th on the difficult, hilly course in a time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 44 seconds. The only disappointment was that she couldn't stay in the top 10, finishing 34 seconds behind that milestone.\n\nStill, being at the head of the pack was something she'll always remember. She even choked up a bit talking about the fact that she wasn't the most likely Olympian and how happy she was just to be a part of this event.\n\n“I swear I could hear all of Minnesota cheering for me in the moment when I took the lead,” she said.\n\nLindwurm led the American contingent, as Emily Sisson finished 23rd and Fiona O’Keefe dropped off the pace and stopped just a few kilometers into the race due to injury.\n\nSisson, who qualified for the Olympic team in Tokyo for the 10k, said her run did not meet expectations.\n\n“I’m pretty disappointed,” she said. “Pretty sad. I think there were signs. Three marathons in a year is too much for me. I had some good workouts and no major injuries or anything. I like challenging myself and wanted to do a fall marathon for learning experience and it did help me in the trials. Btu this marathon didn’t feel like the last two, like I needed to freshen up my legs. Lesson learned, unfortunately.”\n\nBoth Americans were amazed to learn that Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands had won the race, barely outfinishing Tigst Assefa of Ethiopa. The marathon was Hassan’s third event of these Olympics, having already won bronze medals in both the 5k and 10k.\n\n“Oh my God,” Lindwurm said. \"My legs are trashed and I don’t know how she’s running on tired legs. She’s amazing.”\n\nSaid Sisson: “I’m not surprised. She’s a generational talent. I think she is solidified as the GOAT now, if she wasn’t already.” — Dan Wolken\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm drops off lead pace in marathon\n\nDakotah Lindwurm managed to stick with the lead runners through the 13.1-kilometer halfway point, but has since dropped off the pace set by the lead pack.\n\nThrough 30k, Lindwurm — the lead American runner — was 46 seconds behind the leaders. Another America, Emily Sisson, was more than two minutes behind the leaders.\n\nStill attached to the lead group of Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, winner of the bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000 at Stade de France. The lead group also included three Kenyan runners (Sharon Lokedi, Peres Jepchirchir and Hellen Obiri), two Ethiopians (Tigst Assefa and Amane Beriso Shankule), Romania's Delvine Relin Meringor, Japan's Yuka Suzuki and Bahrain's Eunice Chebichii Chumba. Lokedi clocked in with the top time through 30k at 1:43:59.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm pacing with lead group in marathon\n\nThe women's marathon is underway in Paris, and 29-year-old American Dakotah Lindwurm was right in the mix with the lead group through the halfway point of the race.\n\nLindwurm was in third place with a time of 1:13:25 at the 13.1-kilometer mark, with Australia's Jessica Stenson just ahead in first place at 1:13:22. Lindwurm was among 20 runners that comprise the lead group.\n\nThe Netherlands' Sifan Hassan, who also won bronze medals in the women's 5,000- and 10,000-meter races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, also is among those runners in the lead group.\n\nFellow American Emily Sisson was 27 seconds off the lead. A third American in the race, Fiona O'Keeffe, dropped out of the race during the opening miles.\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.

Of course they remember. How could they ever forget?\n\nAs No. 87 emerged from the Lucas Oil Stadium tunnel on Sunday, a chorus of Indianapolis Colts fans began to chant his name.\n\n“Reg-gie. Reg-gie, Reg-gie” they cried, calling out to him as if he’d never left.\n\nLater, he jogged over to the corner of the north end zone — his corner, Reggie’s corner — and soaked it all in: the love being showered upon him and the euphoric feeling of being back home.\n\n“It is what I always did. I always went to that corner and they’ve always supported me, and the Colts and I just wanted to give it to them,” Reggie Wayne said. “They are special.

It’s permanent. It’s a bond unlike any other, this particular group,” Manning said. “ Hopefully (we can do this again) in another 10 years. I think (Dwight) Freeney and (Robert) Mathis will be retired by then. (Adam) Vinatieri will still be playing. Hopefully we’ll get Tom Moore and Jim Caldwell and Clyde Christensen and kind of get some of the guys who couldn’t make it, Bob Sanders.

He was 49.\n\nKing said Wahl’s death was “heartbreaking.”\n\n“A talented journalist, Grant was an advocate for the LGBTQ community & a prominent voice for women’s soccer,” King tweeted Saturday. “He used his platform to elevate those whose stories needed telling. Prayers for his family.”\n\nOn Friday in Philadelphia, basketball star James said he had been “very fond of Grant.” While Wahl was at Sports Illustrated, he did a cover story on James when James was in high school.\n\n“I’ve always kind of watched from a distance even when I moved up in ranks and became a professional, and he went to a different sport,” said James, speaking at a postgame press conference. “Any time his name would come up I’ll always think back to me as a teenager and having Grant in our building … It’s a tragic loss.”\n\nTyler Adams, the captain of the US men’s national soccer team, which was knocked out of the World Cup by the Netherlands in the last 16, sent his “deepest sympathy” to Wahl’s wife, Celine Gounder, and to those who knew him.\n\n“As players we have a tremendous amount of respect for the work of journalists, & Grant’s was a giant voice in soccer that has tragically fallen silent,” Adams wrote on Twitter.\n\nQatar’s World Cup organizers said on Saturday that Wahl “fell ill” in the press area, where he received “immediate medical treatment on site.”\n\nHe was then transferred to Hamad General Hospital, said a spokesperson for the Supreme Court Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body responsible for planning the tournament.\n\nGrant Wahl at an awards ceremony in Doha, Qatar, in November this year. FIFA/AP\n\nWahl was treated in the stadium “for about 20-25 minutes” before he was moved to the hospital, Keir Radnedge, a columnist at World Soccer Magazine, told CNN Saturday.\n\n“This was towards the end of extra time in the match. Suddenly, colleagues up to my left started shouting for medical assistance. Obviously, someone had collapsed. Because the chairs are freestanding, people were able to move the chairs, so it’s possible to create a little bit of space around him,” Radnedge said.\n\nHe added that the medical team were there “pretty quickly and were able to, as best they could, give treatment.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reacted to Wahl’s death on Saturday, adding that senior State Department officials were in touch with Qatari officials and Grant’s family.\n\n“Grant Wahl was an inspiration to many. Our thoughts are with his wife Dr. Céline Gounder and all those who loved him. State Department officials are in touch with Grant’s family and with senior officials in the government of Qatar to ensure his family gets the support they need,” Jean-Pierre wrote on Twitter.\n\n‘Shocked and devastated’\n\n“Only some days ago, Grant was recognized by FIFA and AIPS (the International Sports Press Association) for his contribution to reporting on eight consecutive FIFA World Cups,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a statement.\n\nInfantino and FIFA media director Bryan Swanson were at the hospital on Saturday to offer any kind of support needed for the family, friends, and the journalists who were also his housemates in Qatar.\n\nThe co-editors in chief of Sports Illustrated, the publication where Wahl spent the majority of his career, said in a joint statement they were “shocked and devastated at the news of Grant’s passing.”\n\n“We were proud to call him a colleague and friend for two decades – no writer in the history of (Sports Illustrated) has been more passionate about the sport he loved and the stories he wanted to tell,” said the statement.\n\nIt added that Wahl had first joined the publication in November 1996. He had volunteered to cover the sport as a junior reporter – back before it reached the heights of global popularity it now enjoys – eventually becoming “one of the most respected soccer authorities in the world,” it said.\n\nThe statement said that Wahl also worked with other media outlets including Fox Sports. After leaving Sports Illustrated in 2020, he began publishing his podcast and newsletter.\n\nOther current and former US soccer players, including Ali Krieger and Tony Meola, shared their condolences, as did sporting bodies such as Major League Soccer and the National Women’s Soccer League.\n\nWittyngham, Wahl’s podcast co-host, told CNN on Saturday the news of his death had been hard to fathom.\n\n“For Americans, Grant Wahl is the first person you read covering soccer. He was kind of the only person for a while … Grant was the first person who really paid genuine attention to this sport in a meaningful way,” Wittyngham said.\n\nSeveral journalists shared stories of reporting alongside Wahl, and having encountered him at multiple World Cups over the years.\n\n“Before he became the best covering soccer he did hoops and was so kind to me,” wrote famed broadcaster Dick Vitale.\n\nTimmy T. Davis, the US Ambassador to Qatar, tweeted that Wahl was “a well known and greatly respected reporter who focused on the beautiful game.”\n\n“The entire US Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl,” US Soccer said in a statement on its official Twitter account.\n\n“Grant made soccer his life’s work, and we are devastated that he and his brilliant writing will no longer be with us.”\n\nUS Soccer praised Wahl’s passion and “belief in the power of the game to advance human rights,” and shared its condolences with Wahl’s wife, Celine Gounder, and his loved ones.\n\nGounder also posted the US Soccer statement on Twitter.\n\n“I am so thankful for the support of my husband Grant Wahl’s soccer family and of so many friends who’ve reached out tonight.

Feeling pretty hairy, bad,” Wahl told co-host Chris Wittyngham in the episode. He added that he sought help at the medical clinic at the World Cup media center, believing he had bronchitis.\n\nHe was given cough syrup and ibuprofen, and felt better shortly afterward, he said.\n\nWahl also said he experienced an “involuntary capitulation by my body and mind” after the US-Netherlands game on December 3.\n\n“This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve done eight of these on the men’s side,” he said at the time. “And so like, I’ve gotten sick to some extent at every tournament, and it’s just about trying to find a way to like get your work done.”\n\nHe further described the incident in a recent newsletter published on December 5, writing that his body had “broke down” after he had little sleep, high stress and a heavy workload. He’d had a cold for 10 days, which “turned into something more severe,” he wrote, adding that he felt better after receiving antibiotics and catching up on sleep.\n\nWahl had made headlines in November by reporting that he was detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match because he was wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights.\n\nHe said security staff had told him to change his shirt because “it’s not allowed,” and had taken his phone. Wahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium.\n\nAfterward, Wahl told CNN he “probably will” wear the shirt again.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Teele Rebane Chris Eldergill", "Jessie Yeung", "Teele Rebane", "Chris Eldergill"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}]}

There was also a higher concentration of micro- and nanoplastic particles in the brains of people with a documented dementia diagnosis than in those without.\n\nThe research highlights growing concerns about the level of microplastics in the environment, which are increasingly being found in the human body.\n\nThe research \"gives one pause,\" said Jason Richardson, a professor of physiology at the University of Georgia who was not involved in the research.\n\n\"They're at a much larger concentration in the body than many of us would have expected,\" he said.\n\nResearchers think the growing amount of plastic humans are exposed to could be behind the increase but say the potential implications for human health remain unclear.\n\nAs plastic breaks down over time, it degrades into smaller and smaller bits ‒ eventually small enough to slip inside the human body.\n\nMost of the plastics the scientists found in brain, kidney and liver tissue were extremely small, less than 200 nanometers.\n\n\"That's roughly the size of two COVID viruses side by side,\" said Campen. A human hair is approximately 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide and a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick by comparison.\n\nCampen and colleagues at the University of New Mexico tested samples of liver, kidney, and brain tissues from people who had died and underwent autopsy in 2016 and in 2024. That included a total of 52 brain specimens, 28 from 2016 and 24 from 2024.\n\nThe particles were found in all of the samples.\n\nThere was not much difference between the amounts of plastic found in liver and kidney tissues between 2016 and 2024.\n\nHowever, samples from 2016, all from the part of the brain involved in thoughts, emotions, judgment and memory, had substantially higher concentrations of plastic particles.\n\nThe quality of the research was extremely good, said Gary Miller a professor of environmental health at Columbia University, who was not involved in the research. These kinds of studies, especially on human brains, are difficult and require great care to ensure that there's been no contamination of the tissue, he said.\n\n\"This was a very well-conducted study with excellent technique that clearly demonstrate these things are in people's brains,\" he said. \"It's very compelling evidence.\"\n\nGiven the difficulty of doing testing on living people's brains \"it's not a bad sample size for an initial study,\" Richardson said.\n\nHow does plastic get into the brain?\n\nThe researchers do not know how microplastics get into the brain. In general, it's believed microplastic particles enter the body when people eat, drink, or breathe them in. Such particles have been found in multiple parts of human bodies: arteries, hearts, lungs, blood, placentas, breast milk, penis and testicles, among others.\n\nFinding the particles in higher concentrations in the brain was a surprise because of the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain against infection.\n\n\"For those of us who work in the brain, showing that the highest levels (of microplastic) were measured in that organ is profound and a bit concerning,\" Richardson said.\n\nThe researchers think one reason there are higher levels of microplastic in the brain is because the liver and kidneys are built to filter toxins from the body, said Marcus Garcia, a doctor of pharmacy at the University of New Mexico and part of the team that did the research.\n\n\"We think the liver and kidney are doing their jobs,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the brain has limited clearance systems,\" he said.\n\nAnother possibility is that brain tissue is about 60% fat, meaning the plastics might stick to it better.\n\n\"If you've ever cleaned a Tupperware bowl that had bacon grease or butter in it, you know it's hard to get fat off plastic,\" said Campen. \"It's possible the nanoparticles are hijacking their way in through lipids.\"\n\nIs the amount of plastic in the brain increasing over time?\n\nScientists who study the amount of plastic accumulating in the human body find that the amounts are increasing over time, mirroring the increase of plastic in our environment.\n\nPeople in the 1920s, before the invention of plastic, would have had none, whereas people today live in an environment where plastic is ubiquitous.\n\nThe amount of plastic in the environment is doubling about every 10 to 15 years, Campen said.\n\nThe New Mexico researchers did find that the amount of plastic in the brains of people who were older when they died was not significantly different from younger people.\n\n\"This suggests that our bodies do clear these nanoparticles, we're not just accumulating them over our lifetimes,\" Campen said.\n\nThis means that lowering the amount of environmental plastic could eventually decrease the amount of plastic building up in our bodies, he said.\n\nHow dangerous are plastic particles in the brain?\n\nAt this point, it's not definitively known whether, or if, it is dangerous to have plastic microplastic particles in the brain. It would also be extremely difficult if not impossible to avoid them, Campen said.\n\n\"They really are everywhere,\" he said. He didn't think people should make dramatic changes in their diet or lifestyle \"to avoid something that may not be avoidable.\"\n\nHis group is investigating the potential sources of microplastic in the environment, including the soil, plants and meats to hopefully get a sense of the amount in the food chain.\n\n\"Just the presence of the plastic doesn’t necessarily indicate that they’re causing negative effects,\" Richardson said. But there are concerns.\n\n“I certainly don’t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain, and I don’t need to wait around 30 more years to find out what happens if the concentrations quadruple,” he said in a statement.\n\nEven if the plastic particles do not leach chemicals into the body, merely their presence could have an effect, Miller said.\n\nAsbestos is a good example of something similar. It was long thought to be an inert compound that wasn't biologically reactive and couldn't cause any problems.\n\nHowever, it became clear that having tiny pieces of asbestos in the lung can trigger an immune response.\n\n\"The lung's immune cells hate it and they try to clear it out,\" Miller said. \"Then you get an inflammatory response.\"\n\nThe same could be true of micro- and nanoplastic particles.\n\n\"When you put a foreign object in the body, our immune system doesn't like it. It can set off an inflammatory cascade that goes on for years or decades – it's going to have consequences,\" Miller said.\n\nWhy would people with dementia have more plastic in their brains?\n\nThe researchers don't know why the 12 brains they tested from people who had dementia had more plastic than those that didn't and don't know if it's cause or effect. But they're leaning toward effect.\n\n\"Remember, dementia is a disease where the brain-blood barrier is impaired and the brain's clearance mechanism is impaired,\" Campen said.\n\nIn addition, as people age, and in people with dementia, the brain also loses volume.\n\n\"Is it the cause? Is it symptomatic? I don't know, but it's certainly worthy of future study,\" Miller said.\n\nChildren could be at highest risk from plastic in the brain\n\nBecause the brain is relatively protected by the blood-brain barrier, there is at least some defense by the body. However, two groups are at special risk, Richardson warned.\n\n\"In very young children, the blood-brain barrier is not fully developed,\" he said. And, as people age the processes that protect the brain are less agile.\n\nThat said, it's too soon to worry, he said.\n\n\"At this point, we don't have enough data to say this is something you should be seriously concerned about,\" he said. \"It hasn't been established whether or not these (particles) can cause adverse effects.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/08/13/rainwater-unsafe-drink-pfas-chemicals-study/10317424002/", "title": "Rainwater is now unsafe to drink due to chemical contamination: study", "text": "It's now unsafe to drink rainwater around the world because of the growing presence of \"forever chemicals,\" a new study suggests.\n\nIn the study, published Aug. 2 in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science & Technology, researchers point to the dangers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.\n\nPFAS are a family of human-made chemicals used in countless products today, from food packaging to waterproof clothing. They can spread in the atmosphere and are now found in every corner of our Earth – including rainwater, snow and even human blood. PFAS are dubbed \"forever chemicals\" because they can last \"thousands of years,\" Clean Water Action notes.\n\nA host of possible serious health consequences has been associated with PFAS, including cancer, infertility and pregnancy complications, immune system problems and increased cholesterol, according to researchers at Stockholm University and ETH Zurich.\n\nAccording to the EPA, most uses of PFOA and PFOS were \"voluntarily phased out by U.S. manufacturers,\" but some products still use them.\n\nIn the Aug. 2 study, the team of environmental scientists noted that worldwide guidelines for levels of PFAS in drinking water have \"progressively decreased over the last 22 years,\" notably because of new research and awareness about the toxicity of PFAS.\n\nPFAS nationwide:EPA finds no safe level for two toxic 'forever chemicals,' found in many U.S. water systems\n\nPlastic pollution:Microplastics have been found in air, water, food and now ... human blood\n\nThe declines underline growing concern about the chemicals, and what amount is safe to drink. For example, the researchers found that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency health advisory for allowable levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one PFAS variant associated with cancer risks, had declined by a factor of 37.5 million over the years – most recently from 70 parts per trillion (ppt) to 0.004 parts per trillion.\n\nThe researchers found the levels of PFOA in drinking water in every part of the world, even some of the most remote areas, exceeded the EPA's contamination guidelines.\n\nThat means \"rainwater everywhere would be judged unsafe to drink,\" Ian Cousins, lead author of the study and environmental science professor at Stockholm University, said in a university press release. \"Although in the industrial world we don’t often drink rainwater, many people around the world expect it to be safe to drink and it supplies many of our drinking water sources.”\n\nToxicity of water:Across the US, towns warn of toxic PFAS chemicals in drinking water. Here's what to know.\n\n'Polluted' babies, millions dead:Scientists sound alarm on global pollution\n\nThe study also found that levels of other PFAS variants, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), also exceeded U.S. guidelines in numerous rural and urban regions around the globe.\n\n“The extreme persistence and continual global cycling of certain PFAS will lead to the continued exceedance of the above-mentioned guidelines,” Martin Scheringer, a co-author of the study and a professor based at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, said in the news release.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nThe researchers concluded that the safe \"planetary boundary\" for PFAS has been exceeded, carrying immense consequences for environmental and human health.\n\nThe study underlined that action to prevent further damage was urgent – such as \"large investment in advanced cleanup technology\" and \"rapidly restricting uses of PFAS wherever possible.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/03/25/plastics-found-inside-human-blood/7153385001/", "title": "Microplastics have been found in air, water, food and now ... human ...", "text": "New research has found evidence of plastic in the bloodstream of humans for the first time.\n\nMicroplastics, microscopic pieces of plastic, have been found in water, air, fish and foods.\n\nMicroplastics occur from the breakdown of paints and plastic products, including single-use objects such as plates and shopping bags.\n\nPlastic – it's in your blood.

Vethaak is among the authors of a study published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Environment International.\n\nPlastic particles were found in the blood of more than three-fourths (17 out of 22) of the Netherlands-based donors who participated in the study. Of course, knowing there is plastic in the blood of many people just leads to more questions for researchers to tackle.\n\nWhat lies beyond our solar system?

Most prominent was polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common type of plastic used in making drink bottles, food packaging and fabrics, and even lip gloss.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nThe second most commonly found plastic in the samples: polystyrene, which is used to make a wide variety of common household products including disposable bowls, plates and food containers, and what we call styrofoam.\n\nThe third most likely plastic found in subjects' blood was polyethylene, a material regularly used in the production of paints, sandwich bags, shopping bags, plastic wrap and detergent bottles, and in toothpaste.\n\nPolypropylene, used in making food containers and rugs, was also found in subjects' blood, but at concentrations too low for an accurate measurement.\n\nDid you know?\n\nHumans have produced 18.2 trillion pounds of plastics – the equivalent of 1 billion elephants – since large-scale plastic production began in the early 1950s. Nearly 80% of that plastic is now in landfills, researchers say. By 2050, another 26.5 trillion pounds will be produced worldwide.\n\nPlastic flowing into the world's oceans, rivers and lakes will increase from 11 million metric tons in 2016 to 29 million metric tons annually in 2040, the equivalent of dumping 70 pounds of plastic waste along every foot of the world's coastline, according to research from The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\n\n\nYou eat or breathe in about 2,000 tiny plastic particles each week, the World Wildlife Federation found in a 2019 study. Most are ingested from bottled water and tap water.\n\n\n\nThe overall concentration of plastic particles in the donor's blood averaged 1.6 micrograms, or one-millionth of a gram – the equivalent to one teaspoon of plastic per the amount of water in ten large bathtubs, researchers say.\n\nThat's not much, but researchers only searched for a few plastic polymers. And plastic particles may be in different concentrations in different parts of the body.\n\nResearchers particularly wonder whether microplastics – or even smaller particles called nanoplastics – could affect the brain, digestive system and other parts of the body. Could they help cancers develop or grow?\n\n\"More detailed research … is urgently needed,\" Vethaak and other researchers say in a separate article published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Exposure and Health. \"The problem is becoming more urgent with each day.\"\n\nMicroplastics: A problem that's not going away\n\nThat's because microplastics, a type of pollution, are literally everywhere, having been found from the bottom of the ocean to Mount Everest. We've known that fish have been ingesting them.\n\nMore foods including fruits and vegetables may contain microplastics too. Previous research found that infants may ingest 10 times the amount of microplastics that adults do, based on a 2021 study comparing adult and infant feces. Babies could have higher microplastic exposures from bottles and baby toys, researchers suggest.\n\nMicroplastics will continue to spread because plastic production is only increasing, said Jo Royle, CEO of Common Seas, an organization targeting plastic pollution in the oceans. Common Seas, along with the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, commissioned the research. \"We need to hurry up and invest in the research to be able to understand what threats plastics pose to human health,\" Royle told USA TODAY.\n\nShe said her blood, and that of Vethaak's, was analyzed and found to have plastics in the bloodstream but was not included in the published research. \"To find this plastic in my blood, it is concerning,\" Royle said.\n\nWith research, \"we can make informed choices,\" she said. \"But there's a lot of steps that we can take each day to reduce our exposure to single-use plastics and particularly food and beverage packaging.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/09/hampton-beach-nh-after-fourth-july-beach-used-trash-bin/7822058001/", "title": "Hampton Beach after 4th of July: Beach used as a trash bin", "text": "Ellen Goethel\n\nThis time of year, I am constantly explaining to visitors how and where to look for animals on the beach. I usually do an article on tide pooling. Well, this year I am doing it with a little twist.\n\nOn July 5, I took a walk down onto the beach early in the morning at low tide while the rest of the world was sleeping off the aftereffects of Fourth of July celebrations. The only other people I met were the dedicated town and state employees diligently working to clean the beach and the streets.\n\nMuch to my dismay, I found a beach that had been used as a trash bin. Every step I took yielded more discarded plastic than I could pick up in my pail. In 2018 and 2019, I noticed an increasing amount of trash after the fireworks, but it had abated during COVID. I must ask, “Why do people think that because it is dark it is OK to drop every piece of trash on the ground and forget about it?” I hear my mother’s voice in my head, “pick up that trash, you wouldn’t throw it on your living room floor, you don’t throw it on the ground for the wildlife to eat.”\n\nMore:Great white shark sightings rise in New England. Why this might be happening.\n\nSo today while walking the beach looking for interesting things to display at the Oceanarium, I picked up a bucket full of plastic refuse. I had several drink bottles, caps to take out cups, a scrunchy, a headband, a bag from recreational fishing equipment, pieces from snack bags, a nylon sock and underwear, fishing monofilament from someone’s recreational fishing reel and a few things that I can’t mention, all made of plastic. Of note was the lack of any commercial fishing refuse, no rope or buoys, etc.\n\nLet’s talk about what plastic does to the environment. There has been a lot of discussion about microplastics showing up in the ocean. Microplastic is usually caused by the breakdown of plastic into pieces so small that they are undetected by the naked eye. They form much the same way as sand is formed, by the wave action grinding pieces of brittle plastic into tiny bits. Most people have heard about the dangers of these microplastics being absorbed by animals and being incorporated into their muscles and organs. This effect is multiplied in animals that are consuming other animals who have these concentrated plastics. It can cause all sorts of complications from disease to infertility.\n\nAtlantic sturgeon:Endangered ‘prehistoric-looking’ fish spotted near Hampton Harbor\n\nWe sometimes forget that microplastics aren’t the only problem. First, plastic floats. The wildlife cannot differentiate between it and food. I have seen documented marine mammals, sharks, sea turtles, fish, ducks, and seabirds who have been necropsied after death who had eaten plastic, anything from plastic bags to balloons or plastic bottle caps. It appears that many times they have ingested the plastics over and over. The plastic can react with their gastric juices and melt into a hard ball. This is not digestible and will not pass through their digestive tract. It remains in their stomach until they constantly feel full. At which point they stop eating and die of starvation.\n\nOther animals have been found smothered with a plastic bag over their head or caught in their throat. These are grisly ways to die and completely unnecessary. We can fix this in our lifetime. I thought that we had made great strides in stopping this many years ago.\n\nDecorator crabs:The amazing spider crustaceans found in Hampton Beach tidepools\n\nOn a positive note, I did observe and pick up quite a few things on my stroll this morning. I saw a group of eiders preening on the rocks in the tidepools and collected several types of seaweed for our tanks. In addition, I saw live crabs and a lot of molted crab shells, a multitude of live limpets, slipper shells and a whole legion of mussel “spat” (tiny mussel shells no more than a 1/8th of an inch).\n\nI also collected several different clam shells and some broken sand dollars. I photographed a ladybug walking across some seaweed and interrupted some seagulls feasting on the remains of a crab. Life goes on in and around humans and human activity even if we forget to pick up our own mess.\n\nSo, I challenge every reader to take along something to hold trash in the next time you go to the beach and take home, not only your own trash, but any other plastics that you see on the beach. The wildlife will thank you!\n\nEllen Goethel is a marine biologist and the owner of Explore the Ocean World at 367 Ocean Blvd. at Hampton Beach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/health/early-onset-cancer-increase/index.html", "title": "A global epidemic of cancer among people younger than 50 could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she told her husband that she could feel something like a bubble in her abdomen when she lay on her side.\n\nAn ultrasound scan found spots on her liver, which led to blood tests and a colonoscopy.\n\n“There was a tumor the size of your fist, and she had no pain and no problems with bowel movements or anything like that,” recalled Brendan Higgins, her husband, who works as an artist in New York City.\n\nBy the time doctors found it, dos Reis Nunes’ colon cancer had spread. It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-author Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017 at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter. Still angry.\n\n“Life is OK. Everybody is fine. But I’m like, deep down, I’m seething that it happened to her.

Nylon and polypropylene fibers are among the most common. The itty-bitty plastics can build up in top predators like us, as well as birds and fishes. That magnifies metals, toxins and harmful additives associated with plastics.\n\n\"In almost every type of organism that people have studied they have found microplastic, generally – and sometimes fibers – typically in the guts,\" said Maia McGuire, a SeaGrant extension agent in Bunnell.\n\nIn the Mosquito Lagoon, part of the Indian River Lagoon system, Waite found microplastic fibers, fragments and plastic beads in the water, oysters and crabs.\n\nWater samples averaged 15 to 33 microplastic pieces per liter, more than three times what research in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and coastal British Columbia has found.\n\nCrabs in Mosquito Lagoon averaged 23 microplastic pieces per crab, and oysters averaged 16 to 17 microplastic pieces.\n\nMore:Let's spend IRL cleanup dollars wisely: Opinion\n\n\"Although I expected to find microplastics in the organic tissues of the oysters, I was astounded by the quantity I found,\" Waite said via email. \"Compared to previous studies, this study revealed extremely high amount of microplastics in the organic tissues.\"\n\nWaite found crabs had higher overall concentrations of microplastic than oysters, but the majority get expelled.\n\n\"The high abundance of microplastics in water and animal tissues suggested that microplastics are widespread in the IRL,\" Waite concludes in her paper.\n\nThe harm to marine life is unknown because the research topic is so new, biologists say, but some studies show toxic chemicals cling to plastics know to cause ill effects in humans.\n\nMore:Take a virtual airboat tour on the St. Johns River\n\nSubstances such as phthalates – which can cause cancer and endocrine disruption in humans – and other plasticizers used to increase flexibility, durability and transparency of plastics have shown up in whales and other marine life.\n\n\"They are something that lots of toxic chemicals will attach to,\" said Linda Walters, a UCF biologist and Waite's adviser. \"If there are nasty molecules out there, there is a good chance they will find microplastic and attach to it.\"\n\nResearchers have documented more than 180 animal species that ingest microplastics, including sea turtles. In several species, plastics block the digestive system, damage organs and result in reduced feeding, growth rates and reproductive failure.\n\nMicroplastic has shown up in the circulatory systems of wildlife as well.\n\nPlastics lodge in crab gills, decreasing their ability to respire.\n\nMost oysters appear unaffected.\n\n\"The shellfish population are really hardy and really resilient, so this hasn't been an obvious detriment,\" Walters said.\n\nBut long-term effects remain uncertain. Lab research shows plastics harm reproduction and survival rates of shellfish. Fewer filter-feeding shellfish means dirtier water.\n\n\"The oysters are just going to keep accumulating microplastic. It never leaves,\" Walters said.\n\nMore:Let's talk trash - and do something about it\n\nPlastics can dupe birds, too, with deadly consequences.\n\n\"Their guts will just fill with plastic pieces they've eaten, so they think they're full. They starve,\" Walters said.\n\nBoat ropes, fishing equipment, fleece and other synthetic clothing appear likely culprits, she said.\n\n\"That's our best guess,\" Walters said. \"A lot of them were that royal blue color or yellow.\"\n\nOther research has found odd blue fibers floating in the lagoon. In 2015, Alexander Nickerson, a graduate student at Florida Institute of Technology, found similar fibers at five sites in the lagoon.\n\nThe most common particle was a lignin related to cotton, a biodegradable substance with no obvious threat to the lagoon, Nickerson wrote in his paper.\n\nSince there are no cotton plants near the lagoon, the particles are from cotton textiles or cloth, or palms and other common local plants that resemble cotton lignin, Nickerson's paper concludes.\n\nResearch shows cotton only remains in the water for about a month before decaying.\n\nMicroplastics from clothing fibers typically come from sewage and septic tank seepage of laundry water. The tiny fragments also form when plastics degrade in the elements. Rarely, they can come from personal care products such as body wash.\n\n\"It's hard to point a finger at a single source as being the most to blame,\" McGuire said.\n\nWaite found fiber was the most common type of microplastic in oysters and beads the least common. Of those fibers, almost three-quarters were dark blue, suggesting they were from nylon and polypropylene boat ropes and/or clothing fibers.\n\nOf the fragments found, about 88 percent were clear. Waite suspects those were plastics degraded from water bottles, packaging and other types of containers.\n\nThe density of microplastic pieces in water were relatively high compared to other estuaries worldwide, Waite notes. An estuary in China, for example, had 5 and 13 microplastic pieces per liter in water samples collected, about a third of what she found.\n\nThe higher concentration of microplastic in Mosquito Lagoon might be due to it having few openings to the ocean for tides to flush out pollution.\n\nPlastics plague offshore waters as well. Florida researchers for years have found almost all of the baby sea turtles that wash up dead on Space Coast beaches have plastic in their stomachs, some with almost nothing but plastic.\n\nThe baby turtles eat the floating tar from ship fuels and plastic shards within weeks of being born, when they journey 25 to 45 miles offshore to feed in the Gulf Stream.\n\nShards of old milk bottles, bleach bottles and clear plastic bags are among the most common sources, state biologists say, some of it washing down the Mississippi from Missouri decades ago.\n\nThe problem could get worse. Plastic debris has drastically increased within the past few decades, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of marine debris, Waite's paper notes.\n\nIn 1989, the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act made it illegal to dump plastic at sea and U.S. navigable waters. But the law is difficult to enforce, wildlife officials say.\n\nGlobal production of plastics has grown from 1.7 million tons in the 1940s to 311 million tons by 2014 and is expected to double again in the next 20 years, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nThat makes the plastics problem tough to crack, biologists warn.\n\n\"Our lives are plastic-based,\" Walters said. \"I don't think you can tell people to stop using these types of fabrics, but cotton is better for these types of issues.\"\n\nShe says people can help by not letting plastic float away and getting rid of boat lines when they start fraying, which can release hundreds of thousands of fiber fragments.\n\nMcGuire says to avoid products with synthetic fiber, until science unlocks more answers about health and environmental risks.\n\n\"It's a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and we have 10 of the pieces and they're not connected,\" she said.\n\nContact Waymer at 321-242-3663 or jwaymer@floridatoday.com Follow him on Twitter@JWayEnviro and at facebook.com/jim.waymer.\n\nBe plastic aware:\n\nhttp://stjohns.ifas.ufl.edu/sea/microplastics/index.html", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/23/earth-week-2024-plastic-treaty-talks-begin/73418114007/", "title": "Earth Week underway as UN committee debates plastics treaty", "text": "On the eve of an international meeting to debate a global treaty on plastic pollution, Earth Day 2024 on Monday highlighted the planet's growing problem with plastics in events ranging from beach cleanups and seminars to an environmental demonstration in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nSince the first Earth Day in 1970, plastic has become more ubiquitous in our environment. It's now considered \"a crisis of global proportion,\" according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Committee to Develop an International Legally Binding Instrument on Plastic Pollution, including in the Marine Environment.\n\n\"This is right there with climate change as a primordial threat to the planet,\" pediatrician Leonardo Trasande, a researcher and professor at New York University, told journalists at the Society of Environmental Journalists meeting in Philadelphia earlier in April.\n\nBillions of bits of plastic infiltrate waterways and oceans, are consumed in beverages and food and are found in the internal organs of people and wildlife. A 2023 paper published by the National Library of Medicine, and others, shows microplastics can wreak havoc on hormones and contribute to a range of health problems.\n\nIn the lead-up to Earth Day 2024, EarthDay.org organizers promoted the theme \"Planet vs. Plastics,\" calling for a massive reduction in plastic production and the waste stream and urging people to sign a petition backing the treaty. Additional Earth Day events are planned throughout the country.\n\nOn Tuesday in Ottawa, Canada, the U.N. committee begins a weeklong session to try to agree to a draft agreement on plastics in the environment. It’s the fourth meeting since 2022 when the U.N. agreed to develop a treaty to try to curb the flow of plastics into the environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some of the key terms and major issues expected to be discussed:\n\nWhat is microplastic?\n\nPlastic has been found in every corner of the world and has turned up in drinking water, beer, salt and honey, according to Oceana, an ocean conservation group. While some may think of plastic pollution as plastic shopping bags or soda bottles, it's the tiniest particles – microplastics and nanoplastics – raising big concerns.\n\nMicroplastics for example are tiny particles of polymers less than five millimeters long, no bigger than a grain of rice. They come from plastic bottles, synthetic clothing fibers, car tires and other products as plastics break down slowly.\n\nAnika Dzierlenga, a program lead at the National Institutes of Health, said: \"We know very little about what these microplastics or even smaller pieces of plastics, known as nanoplastics, can do to human health in the short or long-term, or even what they can do to the health of the sea turtles and other animals that live in the ocean.\"\n\nWhat are nanoplastics?\n\nNanoplastics are even smaller, only one-billionth of a meter, according to the National Nanotechnology Initiative. By comparison, a strand of human DNA is 2.5 nanometers in diameter and a human hair is approximately 80,000 - 100,000 nanometers wide, the Initiative states.\n\nHow has the use of plastics increased?\n\nThe annual production of plastic, including polymer resins and fibers, increased from 2 million tons in 1950 to 459.75 million tons in 2019, according to Our World in Data, based on a 2023 paper about plastic production published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nEstimates suggest that less than 10% of plastic waste in the U.S. is recycled, while a majority heads to landfills.\n\nHow can plastics be harmful?\n\nPlastic and the particles it produces can be found from the Arctic tundra to the deepest oceans, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.N. It includes everything from large items such as bottles, jugs and plastic bags floating in the ocean and washing up on beaches to the particles that a recent study found may be linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and death.\n\nOne study found bottled water can contain 10 to 100 times more plastic bits than previously thought, while other studies have found microplastics in clouds, rain and in the placentas of pregnant people.\n\nFor some, the bigger concerns beyond the tide of plastic bits are the chemicals and contaminants they carry that have been linked to endocrine disruption and other abnormalities in the human body and the harmful fossil fuel emissions from the production of plastic.\n\nStudies show that microplastics accumulate chemicals and pathogens on their surfaces. \"Microplastics are likely the drug delivery system,\" Trasande said. \"It's the chemicals riding them that are causing the damage.\"\n\nWhat will the plastic treaty discussions include?\n\nThe U.N. committee is scheduled to discuss polymers, waste management, trade, pollution, financing and technology as it tries to reach an agreement among the world's governments, in an effort similar to the talks in Paris in 2015 that produced the global treaty on climate change.\n\nReuters has reported that many plastic and petrochemical-producing countries, including China, Saudia Arabia and Iran do not support language in favor of production limits.\n\nLast week in advance of the treaty talks, the American Chemistry Council, a trade industry for chemical manufacturers in the U.S., released a study by Oxford Economics which concluded a production cap on virgin plastics would carry \"major economic costs.\"\n\nThe study, commissioned by the International Council of Chemical Associations, concluded the implementation of a \"proposed plastics production cap would have unintended global implications going beyond the plastics industry.\"\n\nIn a webpage on plastics and the treaty, the State Department said the U.S. supports the development of \"an ambitious global agreement on plastic pollution that has universal obligations throughout the lifetime of plastics.\"\n\nWhat about plastics in the ocean?\n\nA major focus of the proposed international treaty is plastic in the marine environment.\n\nMillions of tons of microplastics – ranging from the size of a width of a pencil to smaller than a sesame seed – find their way into oceans, according to the National Institutes. The particles move through the food chain to people and they also attract pollutants and carry them into new environments.\n\nAn estimated 33 billion pounds of plastic wash into the ocean every year – about two garbage trucks worth of plastic every minute, according to Oceana. The group has cited a nationwide poll conducted by Ipsos in December 2022 that showed 83% of American voters are concerned about single-use plastic products and 73% support a pause in building new plastic production facilities.\n\nApril Burt, a conservation scientist with the University of Oxford, said her work in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean off Africa, highlights “the vast accumulation of marine plastic pollution bombarding the islands from both at-sea and international sources.”\n\nBut it's not too late to stem the flow, she said. “The global plastics treaty gives us the opportunity to turn the tide on plastic pollution, from policy on the manufacture of plastics to retailer responsibilities and dealing with legacy plastics.\"\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Doyle Rice.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

They failed to act, and now they seek to blame others. Instead of suing us, they could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills. The first step would be to acknowledge what their counterparts across the U.S. know: advanced recycling works. To date, we’ve processed more than 60 million pounds of plastic waste into usable raw materials, keeping it out of landfills. We’re bringing real solutions, recycling plastic waste that couldn't be recycled by traditional methods.\"\n\nOceana, the largest international advocacy organization dedicated to ocean conservation, applauded Bonta’s legal action in a press release. It wrote that it’s time to hold the industry accountable by stopping single-use plastic products.\n\nOceana argues that government policy change, not recycling, will solve the problem of plastics in the ocean.\n\n“Recycling is like trying to mop water from an overflowing bathtub while the faucet is still running,” said Oceana’s plastics campaign director Christy Leavitt. “We need to turn off the faucet and reduce the production of single-use plastic.”\n\nPlastic is everywhere, including in the human body\n\nAs part of a global risk analysis, the World Economic Forum, ranked pollution as the 10th greatest threat, highlighting the proliferation of plastic throughout the globe, claiming that some experts believe we are on the brink of a plastic health crisis.\n\n“Plastics are everywhere, from the deepest parts of our oceans, the highest peaks on earth, and even in our bodies, causing irreversible damage—in ways known and unknown—to our environment and potentially our health,” Bonta said.\n\nPlastic has been found on the high peaks of Mount Everest and in the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean. Seventy-five percent of the garbage collected at this year's annual Coastal Cleanup Day is plastic.\n\nMicroplastics and nanoplastics, the minute particles that all plastic breaks down into has been found in drinking water, the air we breathe, the food supply, and throughout the human body: in the brain, blood, testicles and arteries.\n\nExxonMobil is the world’s largest producer of polymers used to make single-use plastics, according to Bonta's lawsuit. These materials are produced by ExxonMobil from fossil fuels and are then molded (by other companies) into single-use plastic.\n\nAll single-use plastic bags were effectively banned this month by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nExxonMobil's deceptive practices as alleged in the lawsuit\n\nThe California lawsuit alleges \"ExxonMobil falsely promoted all plastic as recyclable, when in fact the vast majority of plastic products are not and likely cannot be recycled, either technically or economically, which caused consumers to purchase and use more single-use plastic than they otherwise would have due to the company’s misleading public statements and advertising.\"\n\nA trade group, The Council for Solid Waste Solutions, a special project formed by the Society of Plastics Industry, which was comprised of all the major petrochemical companies including Exxon, spent millions of dollars to combat the plastics “image” problem and placed ads in major magazines like Time touting the benefits of plastic recycling, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nA 1989 “advertorial” included in the attorney general's announcement, highlighted recycling as a smart solution for plastic waste and efforts to further recycling and recycling technology.\n\nSince 1970, ExxonMobil, through this trade association, also adapted and promoted the chasing arrows symbol for plastics, according to the state's lawsuit. This symbol is now strongly associated with recycling and consumers are led to believe that items with the symbol can and will be recycled when placed in the recycling stream.\n\nIn reality, only about 5% of U.S. plastic waste is recycled, and the recycling rate has never exceeded 9%.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges ExxonMobil continues to deceive the public by touting “advanced recycling” as the solution to the plastic waste and pollution crisis.\n\n“Advanced recycling” (also known as “chemical recycling”) is an umbrella term used by the plastics industry to describe a variety of heat or solvent-based technologies that can theoretically convert certain types of plastic waste into petrochemical feedstock, which can be used to make new plastic.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ExxonMobil promotes its “advanced recycling” program as a breakthrough in technology that will make plastics sustainable but hides important truths about its technical limitations.\n\nWhat the Attorney General is asking for in the lawsuit\n\nThe attorney general is seeking nuisance abatement, disgorgement (which would require the defendants to give up the profits gained through their illegal conduct), and civil penalties; and injunctive relief to both protect California’s natural resources from further pollution, impairment, and destruction, as well as to prevent ExxonMobil from making any false or misleading statements about plastics recycling and its plastics operations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/04/10/lunchables-lead-sodium-consumer-reports-usda/73272198007/", "title": "High levels of lead, sodium found in Lunchables, Consumer Reports ...", "text": "What kid doesn't love Lunchables?\n\nFor decades, the prepackaged assortment of snacks – from deli meats and crackers, to pizza – have become a childhood staple for generation after generation. Lunchables have also in recent years become a menu item at many schools across the United States, thanks to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut Consumer Reports is hoping that changes.\n\nTurns out, the popular snack may not be the healthiest option for growing kids. Lunchables contain a troublingly high level of lead and sodium, the consumer watchdog group warned Tuesday in a new report.\n\n“We don’t think anybody should regularly eat these products, and they definitely shouldn’t be considered a healthy school lunch,” Eric Boring, a chemist at Consumer Reports who lead the testing, said in a statement.\n\nNeed a break?

However, because cadmium is a natural element present in the soil, it can't be altogether avoided.\n\nAs for lead, no safe level exists for children to consume, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.\n\n“There’s a lot to be concerned about in these kits,” Amy Keating, a registered dietitian at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. “They’re highly processed, and regularly eating processed meat, a main ingredient in many of these products, has been linked to increased risk of some cancers.”\n\nThe sodium levels in the store-bought kits ranged from 460 to 740 milligrams per serving, \"nearly a quarter to half of a child’s daily recommended limit for sodium,\" Consumer Reports' testing found.\n\nAll but one of the kits, Lunchables Extra Cheesy Pizza, contained harmful phthalates – dubbed “everywhere chemicals” for their prevalence in plastic that can be linked to reproductive issues, diabetes and some cancers.\n\nSchool lunch policies\n\nConsumer Reports also analyzed two Lunchables kits made specifically for schools that are eligible to be served to children under the National School Lunch Program.\n\nWhile the group didn’t test the school kits for heavy metals or phthalates, chemists did review nutritional information and ingredients lists in the two products – Turkey & Cheddar Cracker Stackers and Extra Cheesy Pizza – to find higher levels of sodium than store-bought versions.\n\nTo meet the requirements of the federally assisted school meal program overseen by the USDA, Kraft Heinz added more whole grains to the crackers and more protein to the school Lunchable kits, Consumer Reports said.\n\n“Lunchables are not a healthy option for kids and shouldn’t be allowed on the menu as part of the National School Lunch Program,” Ronholm said in a statement.\n\nKraft Heinz told USA TODAY in a statement Wednesday the company has taken steps to make Lunchables more nutritious by, for instance, adding fresh fruits to certain kits and reducing the overall sodium by as much as 26%.\n\n\"Many of our Lunchables products are a good source of protein, offering nutrients through meats and cheeses,\" according to the statement. \"All our foods meet strict safety standards that we happily feed to our own families ... We are proud of Lunchables and stand by the quality and integrity that goes into making them.\n\nCR petitions USDA to remove Lunchables from school lunch menus\n\nAs a result of its findings, the non-profit consumer group said it has petitioned the USDA to remove Lunchables from school cafeterias.\n\nThe petition had more than 14,100 signatures as of Wednesday morning.\n\nA USDA spokesperson said in a Wednesday statement to USA TODAY that the agency \"takes very seriously our responsibility to ensure school meals are of the highest nutritional quality.”\n\nWhile the USDA doesn't specifically allow or prohibit individual food items, the agency has requirements in place to \"address the overall content of meals,\" whether on a daily or weekly basis, the statement read. That means, Lunchables would need to be paired with fruit, vegetables and milk, and schools would have to balance how often they serve high-sodium meals, the agency said.\n\n\"This is why we have a new proposed rule which aims to align our programs with the latest nutrition science and modernize our services to best serve kids,\" the statement read. \"Strengthening the nutrition of school meals comes from a common goal we all share: to help kids be healthy.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The singer took home three trophies, including one, finally, for album of the year. It was a rough night for Swifties, however, as Taylor Swift lost every category she competed in. So did Billie Eilish.\n\nBut that’s not all. Kendrick Lamar swept, Sabrina Carpenter picked up two wins and Chappell Roan came out on top in arguably the most competitive best new artist race in recent years. Plus there was bold fashion, high-energy performances and plenty of touching tributes to Los Angeles, which hosted the ceremony after being ravaged by wildfires in one of our country's worst natural disasters.\n\nThere was a lot packed into one awards show, but we’ve got you covered. Here are all the highlights from the 67th annual Grammys.\n\nBeyoncé finally wins album of the year; Taylor Swift leaves empty-handed\n\nAt long last: Beyoncé has won album of the year.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAfter about (checks notes) a gazillion nominations and a long, long career, Beyoncé finally won album of the year, for the country-tinged “Cowboy Carter.” Her daughter Blue Ivy led her by the hand to the stage in a sweet moment.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech, Beyoncé took a moment to acknowledge and praise Los Angeles firefighters, some of whom announced the contenders and her win. She said she feels “very full and very honored” and that “it’s been very many years” leading up to her win. No kidding.\n\nMore:Beyoncé wins album of the year at Grammy awards for 'Cowboy Carter'\n\nSwift, on the other hand, ended the night without a single trophy in a sharp contrast to last year, when she picked up her fourth album of the year award. Still, she didn’t seem to care; she and Jay-Z clinked their glasses in cheers after Beyoncé’s win. Beyhive members around the world are surely raising their glasses in celebration too.\n\nWhat is Drake's reaction to Kendrick Lamar's sweep?\n\nKendrick Lamar swept his categories – record and song of the year − and honestly, what I wish I could have seen more than his acceptance speeches was Drake’s reaction. Lamar dropped the track “Not Like Us” amid a heated public feud with Drake that saw them both trade scathing barbs back-and-forth in songs, including serious allegations of abuse. \"Not Like Us\" is a diss track aimed at Drake, and Drake has sued Lamar's record label over it. Clearly the Recording Academy is team Lamar.\n\nDespite the track’s harsh origin, Lamar gave acceptance speeches that were much more mild. His first paid tribute to his home city of Los Angeles and offered encouragement to those wanting to rebuild the city after the fires. That message might be one of the only things he and Drake could both agree on.\n\nGrammy winners full list:Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Chappell Roan take top awards\n\nTaylor Swift loses again as Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars win best pop duo/group performance\n\nIs Swift – dare we say – going to be the big loser of the night? After sweeping the Grammys last year, she lost two of her categories. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won best pop duo/group performance for their song “Die with a Smile,” beating Swift and Gracie Abrams, who were nominated for their song “Us.” Stay strong, Swifties – there’s still album of the year, record of the year and song of the year to go.\n\nMore:Taylor Swift snubbed at the Grammys, walks away with zero awards\n\nGaga continued the trend of giving acceptance speeches with political undertones. “I just want to say tonight that trans people are not invisible,” she said. “The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love. Thank you.”\n\nShakira shouts out 'immigrant brothers and sisters'\n\nAfter winning best Latin pop album for \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\" Shakira gave a shout-out to fellow immigrants, dedicating her trophy to them. Her speech took on deeper resonance amid ICE raids across the country.\n\n“I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said. “You are loved, you are worth it and I will always fight with you.”\n\nShe added: “To all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for their families, you are the true she-wolves.”\n\nThe Weeknd ends Grammys boycott. OK?\n\nThroughout the entire show, host Trevor Noah had been hyping up something big. Now, it’s finally here. What could it be? Will Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus duet their hit from “Cowboy Carter”? Will a legend like Dolly Parton return to sing Beyoncé’s version of “Jolene” with her? Is Swift finally going to announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)”? Sorry, Beyhive and Swifties – none of those things are happening.\n\nInstead, the big announcement was… the return of The Weeknd to the Grammys! That’s right, he was boycotting the ceremony − remember? Because I didn’t.\n\nMore:The Weeknd gives surprise performance at Grammy Awards after Recording Academy boycott\n\nRecording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. took the stage to announce updates to the organization’s voting body, saying its members are now younger and more diverse. Because of that, The Weeknd has decided to end his Grammys boycott. And that’s not all! He’s performing too.\n\nListen, if the Recording Academy wants to publicly pat itself on the back, they have every right to do that – it’s their show after all. But can they at least not lead viewers on by making us think a music legend was actually taking the stage? The Weeknd's performance was fine, but it was certainly not worth all that hype.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that The Weeknd’s big Grammys return is coming just as he has an album and tour to promote. How big of him. You can practically feel the forgiveness, healing and reconciliation through the television screen.\n\nChappell Roan wins best new artist, advocates for healthcare\n\nPink Pony Club, rise! Chappell Roan is this year’s Grammys best new artist.\n\nVictoria Monét, last year’s winner, announced the category, arguably the most competitive of this year’s ceremony. “That’s a tough category,” she remarked after reading out the stacked nominees list, which included Carpenter, Shaboozey, Doechii, Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and RAYE. You can say that again, Monét.\n\n'Do you got us?'Chappell Roan urges music labels to support developing artists at Grammys\n\nRoan, always one to speak up about things she believes in (for better or worse), took the opportunity to press record labels to provide a “livable wage” as well as adequate healthcare to their up-and-coming artists. It’s a struggle she said she knows personally: Roan, who’s been dropped by a label before, said she knows what it’s like to not have healthcare.\n\n“Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” she asked.\n\nTaylor Swift announces Beyoncé’s big country win\n\nIf any artist knows about bending and breaking genres, it’s Swift, who started off in country and eventually became an all-around pop music sensation.\n\nAt the Grammys, she announced the winner for best country album: Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter”!\n\nBeyoncé looked shocked at the announcement, with her eyes wide as she stood. “Wow, I really was not expecting this,” she said from the stage. “I think sometimes 'genre' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay consistent.”\n\nIt was a sweet moment to watch the two biggest stars in music onstage together and, dare we say, \"holding space\" for each other. Here’s to more grace and genre-breaking for everyone in 2025.\n\nSabrina Carpenter beats Taylor Swift for best pop vocal album\n\nIs the era of Swift sweeping every Grammys category officially over? Has the coven of the Recording Academy declared a new supreme?\n\nCarpenter took home the trophy for best pop vocal album, beating industry veterans Ariana Grande, newcomer Roan and, arguably the biggest artist in the world right now, Ms. Swift, whom Carpenter opened for on the record-breaking Eras tour.\n\nSwift seemed overjoyed at Carpenter’s win, jumping up from her seat and cheering like a proud mom. And speaking of moms, even though Carpenter was visibly flustered, she still remembered to shout hers out in her acceptance speech: “I want to thank my mom for driving me to every voice lesson.\n\nMore:Brutally honest reviews of every Grammys performance including Billie Eilish\n\nDoechii becomes third woman to win best rap album\n\nWe’re only one category in, and history has already been made at this year's Grammys.\n\nDoechii became the third woman ever to win best rap album, taking home the trophy for her mixtape “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” She gave an emotional speech that also shouted out Lauryn Hill and Cardi B, the two women winners who came before her. Carbi B announced the category.\n\nDoechii ended her speech with a direct message to Black women watching: “You can do it. Anything is possible. … Don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you.” Gayle King clearly resonated, appearing to shout \"preach\" from her seat in the audience.\n\nGrammys kick off with touching LA tribute after wildfire disaster\n\nThe Grammys had a somber start and for good reason – as host Noah noted, the awards show comes on the heels of major wildfires that ravaged Los Angles, one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history. Dawes, a band that Noah says lost their childhood home and instruments in the fires, performed Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” with revised lyrics referencing the fires. The star-studded backing band included John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Swift seemed to vibe with it, bobbing her head from her seat in the background. It was a more subdued intro than most Grammys watchers are probably used to, but it was necessary. The wildfires were an elephant in the room that needed addressing, lest the awards show come off tone deaf, which is the last thing fans want tonight. Before the first break, the show also gave some ad time to a local LA business, Orla Floral Studio. They also encouraged people watching from home to donate to fire relief.\n\nKanye West's wife Bianca Censori shocks on red carpet with see-through clothing\n\nAh, the Grammys. Music’s biggest night. The epitome of class, grace, elegance and – oh my, what is Kanye West’s wife doing?\n\nThat was basically our reaction when West – er, excuse me, “Ye,” – walked onto the Grammys red carpet with his wife Bianca Censori. As if their mere presence wasn’t enough of a shock, in videos circulating on social media, Censori dropped her black coat in front of photographers to pose in… literally nothing. Yep, she was in some kind of tight, see-through ensemble that basically exposed, well, everything. I can only imagine the irate conversations happening among Recording Academy producers right now.\n\nIf the shocking moment bodes anything for the main show tonight, we better buckle up for whatever the rest of the evening might hold.\n\nGrammys 2025 red carpet live updates:Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Ye and more\n\nThe Beatles are still winning Grammys in 2025\n\nThe Beatles can't stop and won't be stopped. The 2023 \"new\" song from one of the most popular bands of all time, \"Now and Then,\" managed a win for best rock performance. The late John Lennon's son Sean happened to be in the crowd (he won for another category), and was beyond excited to accept for his dad's band. \"Play The Beatles for your kids,\" he implored the audience. He doesn't have much to worry about: kids love the Beatles, \"yeah yeah yeah.\" A few categories later the Beatles' contemporaries, The Rolling Stones, won best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds.\" A good day for classic rock.\n\nJimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy for audiobook narration\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who died December 29, won a Grammy award for his audiobook \"Last Sundays In Plains: A Centennial Celebration.\" His grandson Jason accepted the award: \"I believe it means so much at this moment in our country and in our history,\" he said, thanking the world for the outpouring of support his family has received since the former president died at age 100. It's Carter's fourth Grammy win.\n\nKendrick Lamar and 'Not Like Us' win three Grammys a week before Super Bowl halftime performance\n\nIs Drake following along at home? Because what may be the next entry in the long-running feud between rappers Drake and Lamar occurred at the Grammys' early awards when Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video. The two artists have traded allegations and insults in diss tracks, part of a very public escalation in hostility between two high-profile hip hop artists that culminated with Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" becoming a hit last May and a federal lawsuit about the song filed this month by Drake. The song includes Lamar calling Drake a \"certified pedophile\" and the accompanying artwork for the track contained an aerial view of Drake's mansion outside of Toronto, with red sex offender symbols placed on the home. More escalation could follow at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 when Lamar performs, presumably including \"Not Like Us\" on his set list, in front of tens of millions watching the halftime performance.\n\nBeyoncé and 'Cowboy Carter' nab a country Grammy\n\nThat’s Grammy-award winning country artist Beyoncé to you! The mega superstar won her first Grammy of the night for best country duo/group performance with Cyrus for their duet \"II MOST WANTED.\" But Bey lost out on best country solo performance to Chris Stapleton and best country song to Kacey Musgraves. Musgraves was the rare A-lister to show up to the pre-show to accept her trophy in person. “There’s so much darkness in the world right now, and it feels so good to be able to fight that darkness through song,\" she said.\n\nCharli XCX gets first ever Grammy by going 'BRAT'\n\n'BRAT' summer may be over, but that doesn't mean Charli XCX is slowing down. The electronica artist and lime-green fashion influencer won her first Grammy for best pop dance recording for her song \"Von Dutch,\" and then won her second Grammy soon after for best dance/electronic music album for her viral 2025 album 'BRAT.' The album also won later in the ceremony for best recording package. Very cool, very brat.\n\nSabrina Carpenter wins first Grammy of the night with 'Espresso'\n\nA sign of things to come? Carpenter won the first Grammy award of 2025 for best pop solo performance for her smash summer anthem \"Espresso,\" but the \"Short N' Sweet\" performer wasn't there to grab her trophy. She also won best remixed recording alongside Mark Ronson and FNZ for “Espresso (Mark Ronson x FNZ Working Late Remix).” We'll see her later at the televised ceremony, and maybe with a few more wins? She is also nominated for the big four categories: song of the year, record of the year, album of the year and best new artist.\n\nDEI may be out with Trump, but it's very much in at the Grammys\n\n\"This is going to get political, but I promise you I will bring you nothing but joy,\" said Grammy nominee Justin Tranter, a songwriter nominated for song of the year for his work on Roan's \"Good Luck, Babe!\" The musician, who has penned tunes for Britney Spears and Grande among many others, helped kick off the ceremony with opening remarks that directly referred to President Trump's policies and executive orders that have affected people of color and members of the LGTBTQ community. His mention of the Recording Academy's \"diversity equity and inclusion team\" (which provided ASL interpreters for the ceremony) got a big round of applause from the audience. His passionate speech came after Tammy Hurt, chair of the Recording Academy's board of trustees, similarly celebrated Grammy diversity, calling out her own queer identity to great applause.\n\nEarly Grammy Awards kick off with touching tribute to LA amid wildfire crisis\n\nA bevy of talented Grammy nominees including Wayne Brady (here for his nominated musical theater album, \"The Wiz\"), sang a heartfelt arrangement of Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" while images of the devastated city of Los Angeles flashed on the screen behind them. The powerful performance also included Angélique Kidjo (nominated for global music performance), Scott Hoying (nominated for arrangement, instrumental or classic), Deborah Cox (nominated for musical theater album), Taj Mahal (nominated for American roots performance and blues album) and Yolanda Adams (nominated for gospel performance/song).

She was the leading nominee for the People's Choice Country Awards with a total of 12 nods. However, she didn't take home any awards. She won her first country awards at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards when she was named top country female artist in December.\n\nPrior to releasing \"Cowboy Carter,\" Beyoncé got candid about her struggles within the industry and alluded to her 2016 performance at the CMA Awards with The Chicks.\n\n\"This album has been over five years in the making.

Will her \"Cowboy Carter\" album be the project that finally lands her the night's top prize?\n\n\"Well, first it's a beautiful album, but it's also an ambitious album, because she's bringing together a deep knowledge of different kinds of musical genres,\" says Francesca Royster, author of \"Black Country Music: Listening for Revolutions\" and professor of English at DePaul University. \"She's claiming a space in country music, which we know from the past year has still had a lot of barriers in terms of Black artists, despite its roots in Black creativity.\"\n\nBeyoncé's double-digit nominations this year made her the most-nominated artist of all time with a total of 99 throughout her career.

And that's always the way it's going to be with regard to the Grammys and Black music, specifically hip-hop influenced Black music, and I certainly include Beyoncé in that number.”\n\nAt the 2024 Grammys, Jay-Z called out the Recording Academy for its history of snubbing Beyoncé during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. As a result, he drew attention to the lack of recognition Black artists have endured at the esteemed award show.\n\nBeyoncé released her chart-topping album \"Cowboy Carter\" on March 29, and it broke records and made history on multiple fronts. Additionally, she put a spotlight on Black country artists, the genre's roots and the ongoing discussion about the gatekeepers of country music.\n\n\"There are all these fruitful ways that the album has already impacted our cultural conversations about the music industry, about history, about black creativity,\" Royster says. \"She's also created an album that just feels and sounds good on top of all of that. ... So hopefully the Grammys will recognize that.\"\n\nSo far, only three Black women have won the album of the year award in Grammy history: Natalie Cole (1992), Whitney Houston (1994) and Lauryn Hill (1999).

It's even bigger than these arguments about belonging within country music.\"\n\nCarson believes the Grammy Awards shouldn't be the only metric of success, especially given its complicated history with recognizing Black artists.\n\n\"I'm far more interested in the way that 'Cowboy Carter' being a country album can facilitate our conversations about about genre and race in the country, which I think is what the album is doing, regardless of the acknowledgment from the Grammys.\"\n\nFull list of Beyoncé's 2025 Grammy nominations\n\nAlbum of the year: \"Cowboy Carter\" Record of the year: \"Texas Hold 'Em\" Song of the year: “Texas Hold 'Em” Best pop solo performance: “Bodyguard” Best pop duo/group performance: “Levii's Jeans” featuring Post Malone Best melodic rap performance: “Spaghettii” featuring Linda Martell and Shaboozey Best country solo performance: “16 Carriages” Best country duo/group performance: “II Most Wanted\" featuring Miley Cyrus Best country song: “Texas Hold 'Em” Best country album: \"Cowboy Carter\" Best Americana performance: “Ya Ya”\n\nFollow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/01/31/beyonce-grammy-award-nominations-cowboy-carter/77696096007/", "title": "Every award Beyoncé is nominated for at the 2025 Grammys", "text": "Beyoncé was already the most-decorated artist in Grammy history, and now she's most nominated and the leading nominee at the 2025 award show.\n\nThe 32-time Grammy Award winner received 11 nods, including some first-time nominations, at the 67th annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Sunday at the Crypto Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nAhead of the esteemed award show, here's a full list of all the awards the \"Cowboy Carter\" creator is up for this year and more context for each one provided by the Grammys.\n\nFull list of Beyoncé's 2025 Grammy nominations\n\nAlbum of the year: \"Cowboy Carter.\" Awarded to artists(s) and to featured artist(s), songwriter(s) of new material, as well as producer(s), recording engineer(s), mixer(s) and mastering engineer(s) credited with 20% or more playing time of the album.

Short of going more pop, or magically becoming a white artist, it's unclear. Beyoncé’s loss is emblematic of the Grammys' most glaring problems, confirming that \"music's biggest night\" is just as out-of-touch and racially fraught as critics claim.\n\nHere's why Beyoncé didn't win, and why she should have.\n\nWHY SHE LOST\n\nThe Grammys love Adele — and her sales numbers\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhile Beyoncé’s loss dismayed many fans, it wasn’t a surprise to some Grammys-watchers. Adele is a perennial favorite at the awards, sweeping the 2012 Grammys with six trophies for 21. Thanks to its earlier release date, her album 25 dwarfed Lemonade in sales. While the two albums posted similar numbers in 2016 (2.4 million and 2.2 million total units, respectively), Adele had already also sold 8.01 million units in 2015 before Lemonade arrived in April 2016.\n\nBlack artists have struggled to win album of the year\n\nThe Grammys’ album of the year preferences extend beyond just stats. Last year, Frank Ocean told the New York Times that he was skipping the Grammys because of the voters' weak track record in recognizing black artists, particularly when it comes to album of the year. “1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp A Butterfly. Hands down one of the most 'faulty’ TV moments I’ve seen,” Ocean wrote in a subsequent Tumblr post, pointing out how Taylor Swift’s album beat out the Kendrick Lamar favorite last year.\n\nAnd as one viral tweet illustrated, the Grammys’ track record of awarding album of the year to a pop album, rather than a rap or R&B favorite, just extended into its fifth straight year.\n\nThe Grammys have an 'urban contemporary' problem\n\nIn one of the modern Grammys’ most worrisome trends, critically-favored rap and R&B artists are rewarded in their respective genre categories, while rarely taking home the night’s biggest award. It’s a struggle that Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Kendrick Lamar all know well. Bey’s Lemonade took home best urban contemporary album last night, the category that Ocean’s Channel Orange won in 2013, while Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly was awarded best rap album in 2016.\n\nNone of the three artists have won album of the year, with Beyoncé nominated in the category three times. Yet, Bey fans hoped that the 2017 awards would be different, with her visually-sumptuous and critically-acclaimed Lemonade a big enough achievement to overcome the Grammys’ questionable history of racial inequity.\n\nWHY BEYONCÉ SHOULD HAVE WON\n\nThe album was culturally significant and unparalleled in its impact\n\nAdele’s album of the year win wasn't exactly as an upset; the record-breaking sales and positive reviews of the worldwide-beloved album speak for itself. But as Adele alluded to backstage, Beyoncé winning an album of the year for Lemonade would’ve recognized not just her music, but the vital cultural role the singer occupied in 2016, a pop mega-star whose work still spoke powerfully to members of her race and gender. “I felt like it was her time to win,” Adele said.\n\nShe was right. 25 and Lemonade both explored the struggles of being a wife and/or mother, and while Adele's album was just as swooping and cinematic as her fans hoped, it didn't take the same risks with genre, or attempt an evocative narrative arc, like Lemonade did. Add on the fiery political edits of Formation, and the album's accompanying short film, and you get a work that's so much more substantial than the tidy adult-contemporary collection that took home album of the year.\n\nBeyoncé will get more chances at the top prizes, even if she has to record an album of jazz standards or pop covers to finally claim album of the year. And yet, Lemonade will never have another chance to win, and another contemporary masterpiece from a black artist is overlooked.\n\nBrutally honest rankings of every Grammy performance\n\n5 things you should know happened at the Grammys", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/01/29/grammy-predictions-wins-2025/77984289007/", "title": "Grammy predictions wins for Beyoncé, Sabrina Carpenter", "text": "Women dominate the major nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards, but that doesn’t mean an absence of testosterone.\n\nKendrick Lamar and Shaboozey could sneak in a win, but there are bigger questions to ponder.\n\nWill it be another musical showdown between Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, with 11 and six nominations, respectively?

In this case, it would be the patchwork Beatles song that marks the band’s final recording and would give the icons their win for first record of the year. (And who wouldn’t want to hear an acceptance speech from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr?)\n\nBut tweaks to the voting procedure and a surplus of robust contenders – Roan, Eilish and Swift among the top – means The Beatles won’t get the final jewel in the Big Four category crown, having won best new artist, album of the year (“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”) and song of the year (“Michelle,” attributed to McCartney and John Lennon) in the 1960s.\n\nThough Roan’s searing “Good Luck, Babe!” granted her supernova status, the omnipresence of Carpenter’s breakout smash after a decade in the industry (see: best new artist) guarantees coronation.\n\nWho will win album of the year?\n\n“New Blue Sun” André 3000\n\n“Cowboy Carter” Beyoncé\n\n“Short n' Sweet” Sabrina Carpenter\n\n“Brat” Charli xcx\n\n“Djesse Vol. 4” Jacob Collier\n\n“Hit Me Hard and Soft” Billie Eilish\n\n“The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess” Chappell Roan\n\n“The Tortured Poets Department” Taylor Swift\n\nWho will win: “Cowboy Carter” Beyoncé\n\nWho should win: “Cowboy Carter” Beyoncé\n\nThough there is no denying the epic scope of Swift’s “Tortured Poets …” − and a win would make her the first artist to win five album of the year Grammys – this is finally Beyoncé’s year for a distinction she has coveted and more than just Adele thinks she’s deserved. Will a Bey triumph for her eighth studio album suggest amends for “Lemonade” and “Renaissance” falling into “it was an honor just to be nominated” territory? Possibly. But it should signal merited victory for bulldozing country music conventions, shrewdly showcasing both heroes (Dolly Parton, Linda Martell) and newcomers (Tanner Adell, Tiera Kennedy among them) of the genre and, through oft-profound lyrics, exposing Beyoncé’s vulnerabilities as a mother, daughter and wife.\n\nWho will win song of the year (goes to songwriter)?\n\n“A Bar Song (Tipsy)” Shaboozey.

He alone wrote the brash, encyclopedic mic drop in his feud with Drake and the song’s ceaseless popularity (it surpassed 1 billion Spotify streams this month) shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\nBut even with his pending Super Bowl halftime appearance and seven nominations to complement his 17 Grammy Awards, Lamar still feels like an outsider to the general awards (as opposed to the rap and R&B categories he has won). Voters might edge out his audacious proclamations to instead award two titans, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, whose semi-retro duet is another well-crafted megahit that sits just far enough outside the conglomerate of Swift, Beyoncé, Eilish and Carpenter to seal a win.\n\nWho will win best new artist?\n\nWho will win: Sabrina Carpenter\n\nWho should win: Chappell Roan\n\nThis year’s category is, as usual, stacked with some questionable math on the definition of a new artist. Grammy rules list many provisos including making a major impact, first recording that established the artist’s public identity and so on. Those loopholes are especially relevant this year because the frontrunner, Carpenter, has worked in the industry for more than a decade and released her debut, “Eyes Wide Open,” in 2014, around the same time she starred in the Disney Channel’s “Girl Meets World.” But her graduation from teen pop personality to coy sexpot commenced with the arrival of “Espresso” last spring and suddenly, a major chart-topping star was born.\n\nRoan’s path has followed a similar decade-ish zigzag of detours until she achieved moderate success and rampant adulation in the queer community with 2020’s “Pink Pony Club.” But 2024 was the year her delectable ‘80s-tinged pop graduated from the clubs to overflowing festival crowds.\n\nStill, Carpenter dominated the mainstream and her visibility will be rewarded.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/01/31/grammys-2024-who-could-break-records/72396556007/", "title": "As Grammys approach, here's a look at nominees who could make ...", "text": "It's Grammy time!

But other names could make history, ranging from current fan favorites like Billie Eilish to rock legends like Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.\n\nWe run down which artists have a shot at making Grammys history in 2024:\n\nTaylor Swift could win her fourth album of the year award\n\nLet's start with the belle of the pop culture ball, Swift, who this past year managed to become a billionaire thanks to her global Eras Tour, revitalize the movie theater business with her Eras Tour movie, and goose the at times flagging fortunes of the National Football League thanks to her enthusiastic cheering for Super Bowl-bound beau, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSwift will be looking to break her tie with Frank Sinatra and Stevie Wonder as three-time album of the year winners. Swift previously took that trophy for \"Fearless,\" \"1989\" and \"folklore.\" If she won a fourth time for \"Midnights\" she would vault her past those two legends. (If you're the betting type, sites such as VegasInsider routinely run down the odds for big awards shows.)\n\nThe singer also is looking to get rid of a certain Grammy record: She's the most nominated artist to never win song of the year. Swift nabbed her record seventh nomination in this category for \"Anti-Hero.\" She holds another Grammy anti-record in the best pop solo performance category: her fifth nomination, for \"Anti-Hero,\" makes her the most nominated musician without a win.\n\nIn more Taylor Swift Universe news, Jack Antonoff ...\n\nSome of you may know Jack Antonoff for his musicianship duties in Bleachers and, previously, the band named fun. But the talented songwriter has of late been inextricably linked to some of the best work from Swift, winning producer of the year nonclassical honors in 2023 and 2022. If he takes home the trophy in that category again this year, he'd join Babyface as the only three-times-in-a-row winners (Babyface did it in 1995, 1996 and 1997).\n\nAntonoff is up for five other Grammys including work with Swift for album, record and song of the year. If Antonoff were to win the record of the year Grammy as producer on \"Anti-Hero,\" he would be part of an elite Grammy club of artists who have won all four \"majors\" at the Grammys: record, song, album and best new artist (with fun). Adele, Eilish and Christopher Cross are the only others in the club.\n\nWill Jon Batiste extend his Grammys glow in 2024?\n\nJon Batiste, the former bandleader for Stephen Colbert, was the de facto star of the 2022 Grammys, taking home the vaunted album of the year trophy for \"We Are.\" The musician/singer/composer has remained in the spotlight musically and culturally, thanks to both his latest album, \"World Music Radio,\" and \"American Symphony,\" an Oscar-favorite documentary chronicling the journey of Batiste and his wife, Suleika Jaouad, during a recurrence of her leukemia.\n\nIf Batiste were to win this year's Grammy for album of the year, he would be not only among a handful of musicians to win this top Grammy prize twice but also join an elite duo (Adele and Stevie Wonder) who has won two consecutive studio releases. Batiste also could be the first recording artist to win two best American roots performance Grammys if he wins with \"Butterfly.\"\n\nWill Billie Eilish make record of the year history?\n\nEilish is no stranger to the golden gramophone. To date, she has seven trophies from 25 nominations. But her nomination for record of the year (for \"What Was I Made For?\" from the hit movie \"Barbie\") sets the singer/writer up for a historic moment.\n\nIf Eilish were to win her third record trophy (she previously scored here with \"Bad Guy\" and \"Everything I Wanted\"), she would become the only female performer with three such accolades, vaulting past two-time winners Adele, Norah Jones and Roberta Flack. Three wins would make her tied with two other triple winners, all men: Paul Simon and Bruno Mars.\n\nKendrick Lamar looks to extend his Grammys dominance\n\nKendrick Lamar isn't looking so much to set a record as he is aiming to make sure few can touch his current records. The rapper has 17 trophies from 50 nominations, and in 2024 he's looking to add to that pile.\n\nFor starters, Lamar could extend his wins to seven in the best rap performance category if he takes the trophy for \"The Hillbillies\" (with Baby Keem). On top of that, should Lamar also win in the best music video category for \"Count Me Out,\" that would be a record-setting third win in that category.\n\nJelly Roll could be the oldest best new artist\n\nIf Jelly Roll, who is 39, wins best new artist, he’ll be the oldest solo artist to win in that major category. Sheryl Crow, who was 33 when she won in 1995, holds the title.\n\nThe Nashville, Tennessee-born singer has floated around the music industry since 2011, it took a decade and some major personal bumps for him to achieve mainstream success. The burly belter hit the Billboard mainstream rock chart in 2021 with “Dead Man Walking,” but by 2022 crossed over to country. A string of Top 10 songs on Billboard’s Hot 100, Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts followed, including “Need a Favor,” “Save Me” (with Lainey Wilson, who's nominated with Jelly Roll for a best country/duo group performance Grammy) and “Wild Ones.”\n\nKelly Clarkson is looking to break away from the great Adele\n\nKelly Clarkson could break her tie with Adele for most best pop vocal album wins. If she takes it for \"Chemistry\" this year, it'll be her third trophy in that category. She previously won for \"Breakaway\" and \"Stronger.\"\n\nThree of this year’s other nominees – Olivia Rodrigo, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift – are each looking for their second win in the category.\n\nRolling Stones and Springsteen could get a hat tip at the 2024 Grammys\n\nYou'd think legends such as the Rolling Stones, and in particular their powerhouse songwriting duo of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, would have more Grammy Awards than they know what to do with. Wrong. The problem? The band's heyday some 50 years back came at a time with the awards were decidedly not inclined to reward rock's bad boys. (Think Chris Cross' \"Sailing\" to get a sense of where Grammy skewed.)\n\nBut there's a chance to remedy that at this year's awards ceremony. The Stones duo, along with Andrew Watt, are up for best rock song honors for \"Angry,\" off the band's 24th album, \"Hackney Diamonds.\" Although the two were nominated before as songwriters (for \"Bittersweet Symphony\" and \"Doom and Gloom\") they've never taken the Grammy stage to pick up that trophy.\n\nAnd while Bruce Springsteen won't be setting any records this year – nor does he need to with 20 statues to his credit – he could make a little personal history if he wins best traditional pop vocal album for \"Only the Strong Survive.\" It would end his Grammy dry spell that's run for 14 years. He last won in 2010 for best solo rock vocal performance for \"Working on a Dream.\"\n\nAnd finally let's check in on the Grammy Awards GOAT, Beyoncé\n\nAs most Grammy Awards aficionados (or humans with ears) can tell you, last year Beyoncé made Grammy history when she won the award for best dance/electronic music album for \"Renaissance,\" making her the artist with the most statues ever: 32. She topped Hungarian classical music conductor Sir Georg Solti, who reigned forever with 31.\n\nWhile Queen Bey isn't going to extend that record this year, she has little to worry about. Most of those remotely in her Grammy orbit has left the planet, including Solti, jazz musician Chick Corea (27) and pianist Vladimir Horowitz (25). Living legends who are close include producer Quincy Jones (28) and singer/musician Alison Krauss (27), but neither of them are nominated this year.

We run down who has the biggest shot at being etched into the Grammy record book.\n\nWill Beyoncé and Jay-Z steal the show? Might Viola Davis add the G to EGOT?\n\nLook for music's superstars – and one spectacular actress – to possibly make a splash:\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe first couple of music, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, could etch their names in Grammy history as, respectively, most awarded artist and most awarded rapper.\n\nAs ubiquitous as Taylor Swift may be, this could be the year she finally takes song of the year honors and makes it an even dozen gramophone statuettes.\n\nPuerto Rican singer and actor Bad Bunny (aka Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) is looking to be the first artist to take album of the year honors for a Spanish-language record.\n\nActress Viola Davis is up for a Grammy for narrating her memoir \"Finding Me,\" which would put her in rare company of EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) winners.\n\nCould Beyoncé become the most awarded artist in Grammy history?\n\nBeyoncé is likely to become the most awarded artist ever, given that she has nine nominations this year. Right now she has 28 awards from 79 previous nominations, tied in second place overall with producer Quincy Jones at 28 awards from his 80 nominations. Both of them sit behind Hungarian conductor Georg Solti, who has 31 Grammys in 74 nominations.\n\nBeyoncé won her first Grammy in 2001 for \"Say My Name\" when she was part of the trio Destiny's Child. Despite all that hardware, she has never won a Grammy in two of the most prestigious categories: album of the year and record of the year. She has nominations in both this year, for her album “Renaissance” and her song “Break My Soul.”\n\nWill Jay-Z become the most awarded rapper of all time?\n\nJay-Z, with 24 Grammy Awards, seems poised to take the title of most Grammy-laureled rapper in history, given his five nominations compared with none this year for the man he's looking to pass: Ye (Kanye West), who also has 24.\n\nThe Brooklyn-raised rapper has a staggering 88 nominations, including this year's quintet that includes nods for album of the year (for his work on Beyoncé's \"Renaissance\") and song (for \"God Did\" and \"Break My Soul\").\n\nHe's tied with his wife in total nominations, and both have rocketed past Paul McCartney, who has garnered 81 Grammy nominations to date.\n\nWill Taylor Swift win her first song of the year with the long version of ‘All Too Well’?\n\nSince winning her first Grammy in 2010 (for \"White Horse\" off \"Fearless\"), Taylor Swift has racked up 11 awards from 46 nominations, including four in 2023.\n\nBut this time she has a chance at making personal history. Having never won in the vaunted song of the year category (a songwriting award), Swift has a shot with the 10-minute short-film version of \"All Too Well,\" her song about the tumultuous relationship of a couple with a notable age difference.\n\nSwift has been nominated in the category six times, on par with past winners Lionel Richie and McCartney.\n\nBTS has another shot at becoming the first K-pop Grammy winner\n\nIn 2021, BTS became the first K-pop act to receive a Grammy nomination (their song “Dynamite” was bested by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande’s “Rain on Me” in best pop duo/group performance), while the year prior, their appearance with Lil Nas X made them the first Korean band to perform on the show.\n\nIn 2022, another attempt at that epic K-pop Grammy first with their hit song \"Butter\" was thwarted by Doja Cat and SZA's \"Kiss Me More.\"\n\nThis year, with three years of successive Grammy nominations, BTS has another shot at history with their song \"My Universe,\" a collaboration with Coldplay. The band is nominated in three categories: best pop duo/group performance, best music video (\"Yet to Come\") and best album (for their appearance on Coldplay's \"Music of the Spheres\").\n\nBad Bunny could be the first album of the year winner with a Spanish-language record\n\nBad Bunny had quite a year, from acting opposite Brad Pitt in the action thriller \"Bullet Train\" to releasing his hit-packed album \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" (\"A Summer Without You\").\n\nNow an album of the year nominee, Bad Bunny is on the brink of landing the first Spanish-language album of the year Grammy, which would serve as quite the marker in terms of the Recording Academy getting with the nation's multicultural reality.\n\nJust two Latin artists have had a shot at album of the year honors, though none for a slate of songs in Spanish. They are Mexican-born Carlos Santana, who won in 2000 with \"Supernatural,\" and Cardi B, who was nominated in 2019 for \"Invasion of Privacy\" but was bested by Kacey Musgraves' \"Golden Hour.\"\n\nAdele's outside shot at making Grammy history\n\nAdele is back in fighting form, with seven Grammy nominations for 2023 for her work on the album \"30.\" She has won 15 Grammys and has 25 nominations. But the competition is particularly stiff in all of Adele's categories this year.\n\nBut the British singer could make history by becoming the first songwriter to win three times in song of the year if she wins for “Easy On Me” (past wins were for “Rolling In The Deep” and “Hello”).\n\nIf she won record of the year for \"Easy On Me,\" she would join Bruno Mars and Paul Simon with that trifecta and be the first woman to hit that target. And a win for album of the year, which would be her third, allows her to join an elite group consisting of Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and Taylor Swift, while being the only one to win for three consecutive albums.\n\nViola Davis shoots for the EGOT\n\nViola Davis, fresh off her starring role in \"The Woman King,\" is poised to make entertainment history if she wins a Grammy for her spoken word album nomination for \"Finding Me: A Memoir,\" which chronicles her journey from Rhode Island to Hollywood.\n\nA win at the Grammys would give her the G in EGOT, the coveted acronym reserved for those who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. That group includes performers such as Jennifer Hudson, Rita Moreno, John Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Robert Lopez, Whoopi Goldberg and Mike Nichols, to name a few.\n\nDavis won her Oscar in 2017 (for \"Fences\"), her Tonys in 2001 (\"King Hedley II\") and 2010 (\"Fences\"), and her Emmy in 2015 (\"How to Get Away With Murder\").\n\nTo help get you in the Grammy groove:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/02/10/adele-chance-rapper-heres-who-we-think-win-grammys/97105534/", "title": "From Adele to Chance the Rapper, here's who we think will win at ...", "text": "Piet Levy, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nIt's a battle of the superstars at the Grammy Awards Sunday.\n\nIn one corner, there's Adele, whose \"25\" became the first album to sell more than 3 million copies in its first week, back in November 2015. Her primary opponent is Beyoncé, who eviscerated her previous singles-focused success with \"Lemonade,\" an artistic leap, clickbait fodder and Black Lives Matter statement all rolled into one.\n\nThey're both frontrunners in three of the four primary categories. Who'll end up victorious? Here are my predictions and thoughts on the deserving winners.\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nNominees: \"25,\" Adele; \"Lemonade,\" Beyoncé; \"Purpose,\" Justin Bieber; \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth,\" Sturgill Simpson; \"Views,\" Drake\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat will win: \"25\" may have been a sales generator unlike any other modern album — an impressive feat given the beleaguered state of the music industry — but Adele was gushing about \"Lemonade\" at one of her shows. \"Lemonade\" was a blockbuster, too, in addition to being a remarkable album. Beyoncé also has more Grammy nominations than any other woman in history, 62, but has never won Album of the Year. That should finally change Sunday.\n\nWhat should win: \"Lemonade,\" my favorite album of 2016 and a frontrunner for favorite album of the decade.\n\nRecord of the Year\n\nNominees: \"7 Years,\" Lukas Graham; \"Formation,\" Beyoncé; \"Hello,\" Adele; \"Stressed Out,\" Twenty One Pilots; \"Work,\" Rihanna\n\nWhat will win: If the Academy's going to give Album of the Year to Beyoncé, you better believe it will reserve another honor for Adele. Adele's revered abilities alongside a simple but unforgettable piano melody make \"Hello\" a stronger contender than the overall album it came from.\n\nWhat should win: \"Hello.\" This award recognizes performance and production, and no piece of music has better demonstrated Adele's vocal talent than this track.\n\nSong of the Year\n\nNominees: \"7 Years,\" Lukas Graham; \"Formation,\" Beyoncé; \"Hello,\" Adele; \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza,\" Mike Posner; \"Love Yourself,\" Justin Bieber\n\nWhat will win: There's been no shortage of questionable Grammy winners, but the Recording Academy wouldn't be foolish enough to hand the prize to the sappy \"7 Years\" or bro-friendly EDM anthem \"Ibiza.\" Bieber's \"Yourself\" is too similar to last year's Song of the Year winner, \"Thinking Out Loud\" from Ed Sheeran. While \"Formation\" made a lasting statement, the simpler \"Hello\" is more memorable.\n\nWhat should win: \"Formation.\" It takes a special song to become a Super Bowl halftime show stand-out less than 24 hours after its release.\n\nBest New Artist\n\nNominees:Anderson .Paak, The Chainsmokers, Chance the Rapper, Kelsea Ballerini, Maren Morris\n\nWhat will win: You'd think rappers .Paak and Chance, and country singers Ballerini and Morris, would cancel each other out. Yet Chance stands out, not just for his music, but for getting seven nominations for \"Coloring Book,\" which benefitted from amendments that now allow streaming-only albums to be eligible for nominations. He'll win, and deserves to.\n\nWho should win: Chance.\n\nWISCONSIN NOMINEES TO WATCH FOR\n\nSunday probably won't be Bon Iver's night; the Eau Claire act is competing against the late David Bowie in the Best Alternative Album and Best Recording Packaging categories.

It's up for Best Contemporary Musical Album.\n\nThe Record Company, with Wisconsin native Chris Vos on guitar and vocals, is a strong contender for Best Contemporary Blues Album for its breakout debut album \"Give It Back To You.\" Tierney Sutton, a Nicolet High School alum, is up for Best Jazz Vocal Album, for reinterpreting the works of Sting on \"The Sting Variations.\"\n\nThe 59th Annual Grammy Awards airs locally at 7 p.m. on WDJT-TV (Ch. 58).

Six words, in all caps.\n\n“WHO THE F--- IS STURGILL SIMPSON?\"\n\nHe imagines that question has been on a lot of people’s lips since the nominations were revealed, and obviously, he’s taking it in stride.\n\nREAD MORE: Sturgill Simpson wins best country album\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn the Grammys’ 59-year history, the race for album of the year never looked quite like it did on Sunday.\n\nNot only was Simpson one of the most obscure nominees in the category’s history, his four competitors were all mega-selling pop superstars: Adele, Beyonce, Justin Bieber and Drake. The award ultimately went to Adele, though Simpson did pick up a win for best country album.\n\nThat album, “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth” has sold 170,000 copies to date. That’s roughly one-tenth of the sales posted by Beyonce, Bieber and Drake, while Adele’s “25” towers over the pack with 9.2 million in U.S. sales.\n\nIt was a nomination seemingly no one saw coming — especially Simpson.\n\n“It was far beyond anything I could ever expect in this lifetime,” he told The Tennessean recently. “I'm elated, and kind of speechless, to be perfectly honest.”\n\nBut let’s put the modesty aside for a minute. For the past five years, the 38-year-old has been taking stages by storm, and showing the world exactly who he is.\n\nA national audience got a taste of it last month, when Simpson and his band appeared on “Saturday Night Live.” Their performance of the ferocious rocker “Call to Arms” was the showstopper. Between fiery verses about bodies piling up in U.S. conflicts, Simpson careened around the stage, howled at the top of his lungs and hurled his guitar onto the ground.\n\nFive years ago, Simpson was giving this kind of show to an audience of 50.\n\nHe settled in Nashville in 2011 after stints in the Navy and a hard-driving country band, Sunday Valley. The next year, he was playing regular gigs at some of the city’s tiniest clubs, including local haunt The Basement. Word spread quickly about the guy who could belt like Waylon Jennings, command a stage and craft powerful country underdog anthems.\n\n\"Won’t hear my song on the radio, 'cause that new sound's all the rage,\" he would sing.\n\n\"But you can always find me in a smoky bar with bad sound and a dim lit stage.\"\n\nIn fact, Simpson wasn’t long for that world. A self-released album and steady touring built up buzz, and his 2014 sophomore effort, \"Metamodern Sounds in Country Music,\" earned universal critical acclaim and brought him to the stages of “The Tonight Show,” Bonnaroo and a sold-out three-night stand at the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nHe made the jump to a major label — Atlantic — for 2016’s “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth.” Its progressive mix of country, soul and rock continued to steer clear of commercial radio play, but new listeners continued to take notice. Clearly, that included the voting members of the Recording Academy.\n\nAcademy President Neil Portnow says their 13,000 voting members select artists “with their eyes closed and their ears open.”\n\n“It's why I think the Grammys are viewed as a stamp of approval by the public,\" he said. \"It's a way to discover new things that are terrific that they might not know about, and for our industry to have great art to rise to the top.”\n\nSome of Simpson’s earliest industry recognition came from the Nashville-based Americana Music Association Honors & Awards, which named him artist of the year in 2015. Association Executive Director Jed Hilly is happy to see the Grammys come around to Simpson, too.\n\n“If this is a sign of something great, in my opinion, it’s to recognize the passion, the art and the craft of making an album. He wasn't writing singles with the intent of having a number one hit. He was writing songs with the intent of telling a story through music in the best way he could.”\n\nStill, several of Simpson’s fellow nominees didn’t just make hits, they also were critically praised — particularly Beyonce, whose “Lemonade” was named the year’s best by Rolling Stone, Billboard and others.\n\nSimpson didn't take home the top prize on Sunday, but the album of the year category is known for frequent upsets. Two years ago, a Beyonce victory seemed set in stone, but it instead went to another album with country strains and Nashville ties: Beck’s “Morning Phase.” Indie rockers Arcade Fire beat out several pop giants in 2011, and robot duo Daft Punk won instead of the seemingly unstoppable Taylor Swift in 2014.\n\nThis year Simpson was the one standing out — even on the ballot, as the album’s engineer and mixer David Ferguson points out.\n\n“If you read the nominations, you see Sturgill's name, and then you see two engineers and a mastering guy, and that's it,” he said. “Some of these (other) records have 30 engineers listed, and they spent a million dollars making a record. This was a close-knit family. That's the way it should be.”\n\nReach Dave Paulson at 615-664-2278 and on Twitter at @ItsDavePaulson.\n\nRead more Grammy Awards coverage:\n\nHillary Scott & Scott Family accept early Grammy Awards\n\nPhotos: Stars hit the 2017 Grammys red carpet\n\nThe Nashville guide to the Grammys\n\n​ Grammys 2017: How to watch on TV and stream online\n\nGrammys 2017: The complete list of winners", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/11"}]}

Its magnitude was 4.8, and this earthquake would have been felt by millions of people,” said Paul Earle, the operations director of USGS’ National Earthquake Information Center, during a noon news coference Friday. “Currently, we have over 100,000 people on our website reporting the shaking they’ve felt.\n\n“Earthquakes in this region are uncommon but not unlikely,” Earle added. “People near the epicenter could experience aftershocks in the 2 to 3 magnitude range.”\n\nThe Friday quake lasted about 15 seconds, starting out strong, with residents in Bucks County reporting feeling their homes shake for about the first five seconds before the quake settled into a low rumble.\n\nBucks County spokesman Jim O'Malley said there were no calls about structural damage or major incidents from the earthquake as of 10:45 a.m., apart from a call about downed wires at an uncertain location.\n\nThings looking up for Doomsdayers::4.8 earthquake before the 4/8 solar eclipse. Is there a connection and what could it mean?\n\nHowever, about 238 calls came in around 28 minutes after the earthquake rattled through Bucks County, according to O'Malley. Twenty-five emergency dispatchers handled 123 emergency and 115 non-emergency calls from the earthquake.\n\nA PennDOT spokesperson said there were \"no reported road/bridge closures related to the earthquake.\"\n\nSEPTA had no reported injuries to customers or employees resulting from the morning earthquake. No damage has been reported, and at this time, all services are operating on normal schedules. The agency was doing routine post-earthquake inspections, which includes infrastructure checks on tunnels, bridges, power facilities, and other equipment.\n\nWill Friday's earthquake cause aftershocks in Bucks County?\n\nOver the next week, the U.S. Geological Survey predicts there will be at least one aftershock, which is a smaller earthquake or series of earthquakes that follow the largest shock of an earthquake sequence.\n\nWhat caused the earthquake felt in Bucks County?\n\nSmall earthquakes are typically felt every two to three years along the urban corridor stretching through New York, Philadelphia and Wilmington, according to a tectonic summary posted on the U.S. Geological Survey’s website following Friday’s earthquake.\n\nDespite this corridor being far from the nearest plate boundaries — which are in the center of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea — the agency said earthquakes can occur everywhere there are faults within bedrock.\n\n“The urban corridor is laced with known faults but numerous smaller or deeply buried faults remain undetected. Even the known faults are poorly located at earthquake depths,” USGS said on its website.\n\n“Accordingly, few, if any, earthquakes in the urban corridor can be linked to named faults. It is difficult to determine if a known fault is still active and could slip and cause an earthquake. As in most other areas east of the Rockies, the best guide to earthquake hazards in the New York - Philadelphia - Wilmington urban corridor is the earthquakes themselves.”\n\nWhile earthquakes in the eastern U.S. are not as frequent as the ones experienced on the west coast, they are known to be felt over a much greater area.\n\n“East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area as much as ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast,” USGS said on its website.\n\nIn addition to these smaller earthquakes, the agency said moderately damaging earthquakes strike the region about twice every hundred years.\n\nBucks reacts to quake:Bucks County rattled at rumbling and rocking from East Coast earthquake: 'What was that?'\n\nEast Coast earthquake considered \"light\" on Richter scale\n\nAccording to the Richter scale, which is used to measure earthquake magnitude, it is considered a \"light\" earthquake. Still, the geological survey posted on X that it was \"notable.\"\n\nResidents in Delaware, Washington D.C., New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts also reported feeling the earthquake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's website.\n\n\"I'm still shaken about it,\" one person posted on X.\n\nThe Richter scale measures earthquakes on a scale 1 to 10, with 10 being the strongest and 1 being the weakest. The weakest ones occur daily, while an earthquake of magnitude 10 is considered a \"super quake.\"\n\nA look back at Earthquakes in Bucks County and the region\n\nA 4.1 magnitude earthquake rattled part of the Delaware Valley on Nov. 30, 2017. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake happened roughly six miles northeast of Dover, Delaware, but it was felt as far north as New York and as far south as Baltimore, according to CBS News.\n\nThe earthquake Friday may be the the largest in southeastern Pennsylvania surpassing one in January 1994 west of Reading at magnitude 4.6. In September 1998, the largest earthquake in Pennsylvania occurred when a 5.2 earthquake struck the Greenville-Jamestown area in Crawford County, in the state’s northwest corner, according to the Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia.\n\nSeismic research has suggested that the Philadelphia region has the potential for larger earthquakes, but the extent is largely unknown.

Remain in the vehicle with your seat belt fastened, engine off, and parking brake set. Once the shaking stops, check your vehicle for damage and its occupants for injuries. Only begin driving when it is safe to do so. Once you can start moving again, do so slowly and cautiously, avoiding any areas of the road that appear to be damaged or obstructed, and continue to avoid bridges and ramps.\n\nCharles Ventura and Elizabeth Weise report for USA TODAY; James Ward reports for the Palm Springs Desert Sun.\n\nContributing: Olivia Munson and Paris Barraza, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/california/2024/08/07/southern-california-earthquakes-could-a-larger-quake-be-next/74713013007/", "title": "Southern California earthquakes: Could a larger quake be next?", "text": "An earthquake and dozens of aftershocks rattled Southern Californians starting on Tuesday night and continuing into Wednesday morning. Could a bigger one be on the way?\n\nAs a general rule, the risk is fairly low. About 5% to 10% of all California earthquakes are followed by a larger one within a week, and the probability of a larger quake depends on how much aftershock activity there is, according to the USGS. Lots of aftershock activity doesn't guarantee a bigger quake, however.\n\nThis latest quake certainly has aftershock activity. A magnitude 5.2 quake at 9:09 p.m. in Lamont near Bakersfield was felt as far away as Los Angeles, over 100 miles from the epicenter. Since then, the U.S. Geological Survey has recorded dozens of aftershocks ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 in magnitude, none as large as the initial quake.\n\nTuesday's earthquake is the most recent shaker to hit California. On Aug. 2, a 3.3-magnitude earthquake centered on the west side of the Salton Sea was felt in parts of Southern California. On July 29, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake centered 14 miles northeast of Barstow rattled the high desert and parts of Southern California.\n\nCan earthquakes be forecast?\n\nExperts say there's no real way to tell whether a large quake will be followed by something bigger until after it happens.\n\n\"We have never found any characteristic that makes a quake more likely to be a foreshock,\" said seismologist Lucy Jones in a social media post.\n\nThere isn't a known fault in the area where the earthquake struck on Tuesday night, but it's still an area known for earthquakes, said Ole Kaven, U.S. Geological Survey research geophysicist.\n\nAs time goes on, the chances of a bigger quake go down, but the swarm of aftershocks does raise some eyebrows.\n\n\"Because of the productive nature of the aftershock sequence, the chance of another shock 5.0 or greater is a slightly higher,\" Kaven said. \"It’s an interesting event in a place you don’t normally expect it, but it is certainly earthquake country so we need to be prepared for the possibility.\"\n\nWhat is an aftershock? A foreshock?\n\nWhen an earthquake is followed by one or more quakes smaller in size in the same area, the later quakes are called aftershocks.\n\nBut when an earthquake is followed by a larger one, the first quake becomes known as a foreshock.\n\nOne last term: The largest quake in a sequence is the mainshock.\n\nComplicating matters: It's not fully possible to identity a mainshock until after the fact — you have to wait to see if a larger quake comes.\n\nHave large foreshocks happened in California before?\n\nAbout half of California's biggest earthquakes in history have been preceded by foreshocks. California's increased seismic activity compared to elsewhere in the U.S. makes it more likely for large quakes to occur in sequence, but the relative rarity of large earthquakes still makes it unlikely.\n\nA sequence of small quakes that began rattling the morning of July 4, 2019, became foreshocks to two of the state's largest earthquakes in two decades, according to scientists at Stanford. Later that morning, a 6.4 near Ridgecrest, California, prompted evacuations and caused fires to break out. The next day, a 7.1 earthquake struck the same area.\n\nWHEN CAN YOU FEEL AN EARTHQUAKE?Quake magnitudes explained.\n\nResearch into one of California's largest earthquakes in history, the 1857 Fort Tejon quake, which hit with a magnitude of about 7.9, shows that in the hours leading up to the mainshock, there were at least two widely felt foreshocks of between a 5 and 6 magnitude.\n\nSan Francisco's catastrophic 1906 earthquake came roughly 20-25 seconds after a foreshock was felt throughout the city.\n\nWhen will 'The Big One' hit?\n\nThe infamous but elusive possibility of a devastatingly large earthquake known as \"The Big One\" always comes to mind when a significant quake strikes in California.\n\nBut there's actually several devastating quakes that will eventually hit the state.\n\nThe USGS estimates that within the next three decades, there's about a 46% chance an earthquake of magnitude 7 will hit in the Los Angeles area, and a 51% chance it will happen in the Bay Area.\n\nThe chances of a 7.5 magnitude quake are 31% in the Los Angeles area and 20% in the San Francisco area in the next 30 years.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do during an earthquake?\n\nIt depends on where you are at.\n\nHere’s what to do in the following situations, according to Ready.gov:\n\nTurn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow if you’re in bed.\n\nIf you are outside, stay outdoors and away from buildings.\n\nIf you are inside, stay.

Quake magnitudes explained.", "text": "The 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck New Jersey on Friday generated shaking that could be felt from Washington, D.C., to north of Boston.\n\nAbout 55 earthquakes a day – 20,000 a year – are recorded by the National Earthquake Information Center. Most are tiny and barely noticed by people living where they happen. Click here to see the USDA shake map for the most recent earthquakes.\n\nWorldwide, there are on average about 16 major earthquakes in any given year, 15 in the magnitude 7.0 range and one 8.0 or greater, according to records going back to 1900.\n\nThe United States typically has around 63 earthquakes between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 each year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, about five between 6.0 and 6.9 and fewer than one between 7.0 and 7.9.\n\nA major 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan on Wednesday morning, killing 12 people and injuring over 1,000. The strongest earthquake there in a quarter century was followed by a series of aftershocks, reaching up to 6.4 magnitude.\n\nMore earthquakes are being recorded around the globe, but that doesn’t mean there are more earthquakes happening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Instead, it’s because there are more measurement devices, called seismometers, that record vibrations and they have been deployed in more places.\n\nEarthquakes are a natural part of life on Earth, a geologically active planet with seven major tectonic plates. These are continent-size slabs of rock that glide over the planet’s mantle, constantly but very slowly reshaping Earth’s landscape.\n\nWhat does magnitude mean in an earthquake?\n\nMagnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. Officially it's called the moment magnitude scale. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each number is 10 times as strong as the one before it. So a 5.2 earthquake is moderate, while a 6.2 is strong.\n\nThe magnitude and effect of an earthquake, according to Michigan Technological University:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt\n\n2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\n6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities\n\nIntensity scales, measured in Roman numerals, are used to describe how strong the earthquake felt to people in the area.\n\nAccording to the California Earthquake Authority, an intensity of I is typically felt only under especially favorable conditions. An intensity of IV, which leads to light shaking, is felt indoors by many, but not typically outdoors. It might awaken some people at night and lead to a sensation like a truck striking a building. A parked car would rock. Intensities VI and above would be strong, frightening and felt by all, with the damage increasing up to an X, where the shaking would be violent. Some well-built wooden structures would be destroyed and most masonry and frame structures along with their foundations would be ruined.\n\nYou might have heard the term \"the Richter Scale\" used to describe earthquakes, but it is no longer commonly used because it was only valid for certain earthquake frequencies and distance ranges.\n\nWhy does an earthquake's depth matter?\n\nMagnitude measures how strong a quake is. That said, how much the ground shakes depends on an earthquake's intensity, which in turn depends on two things: how far away the actual site of the temblor was and the kind of soil it which it occurs.\n\nThis is why an earthquake's depth is often given. The epicenter of the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994 was in the San Fernando Valley, the point where the quake was strongest. But the hypocenter, the location where the quake actually occurred, was more than 11 miles underground. If it had been closer to the surface, the 6.7 magnitude quake would have been even more devastating.\n\nThe type of ground matters, too. Bedrock shakes least, sand and gravel as much as two times more, and mud and landfill as much as five times more. This was a major factor in why some areas of San Francisco suffered more than others in the Loma Prieta quake of 1989.\n\nWhy real earthquakes aren't like in the movies\n\nThough movies like \"San Andreas\" and \"Earthquake\" show entire coastlines dropping into the ocean, it's not going to happen.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Service, while a \"mega-quake\" with a magnitude of 10 or larger is \"theoretically possible,\" it's very unlikely.\n\nThe magnitude of an earthquake depends in part on the length of the geological fault on which the quake occurs. Longer faults result in stronger earthquakes.\n\nThere are no known faults capable of generating a magnitude 10 or larger. The San Andreas fault of movie fame couldn't produce a quake larger than about 8.3 given its length, according to the USGS.\n\nThe largest earthquake in U.S. history was the 1964 Good Friday quake in Alaska, a 9.2 magnitude temblor that killed 131 people. It lasted four and a half minutes and ran along the Aleutian fault.\n\nWhat's the chance of an aftershock?\n\nAny time there's an earthquake, one concern is that it was merely a foreshock to a bigger quake that's coming.\n\nGlobally, the probability that one earthquake will be followed by a large earthquake within three days is somewhere just over 6%, according to the USGS.\n\nThat means whenever there's an earthquake, there's about a 94% chance that it wasn't a foreshock and there won't be any more quakes linked to it.\n\nThe numbers are a little different for California, which is very seismically active. There, about half of the biggest earthquakes were preceded by foreshocks, according to the USGS. But that means half were not.\n\nUnfortunately, it's impossible to know if any one quake is a foreshock.\n\nAftershocks are defined as smaller earthquakes that happen in days after a larger quake. As the USGS puts it, they represent \"minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the mainshock.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/08/08/earthquake-japan-tsunami/74716587007/", "title": "Earthquake hits southwest Japan leading to tsunami warning", "text": "A strong earthquake rattled southwestern Japan Thursday triggering tsunami advisories, the United States Geological Survey is reporting.\n\nThe notable quake registered a magnitude 7.1, the USGS said, and took place about 12 miles southeast of Miyazaki, a city on the island of Kyushu.\n\nThe quake occurred at 4:43 p.m. local time (12:43 a.m. EST).\n\nIt was not immediately known if anyone was injured or whether damage was reported on the island but public broadcaster NKS said waves as high as 50 cm (more than 1.6 feet) had already been observed.\n\nThe outlet also reported Japanese Meteorological Agency on Thursday issued a megaquake advisory, per local protocol.\n\nThe possibility the quake was a foreshock for a larger earthquake is always of concern, but less likely with every hour that passes, said Ole Kaven, a USGS research geophysicist.\n\n\"The rule of thumb is that there’s a 5% chance of an event larger than the main shock happening, and that probability will decrease the more time that passes,\" he said.\n\nEarthquake:Magnitude 4.5 earthquake hits Utah; no damage or injuries immediately reported\n\nJapanese government checking for damages, casualties\n\nThere have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants on the island, Reuters reported, and officials were \"checking for damage and casualties,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.\n\nAccording to its last census, Miyazak had an estimated population of just under 400,000 people.\n\nData provided by USGS showed the earthquake registered more than 15 miles deep in the ocean.\n\nCould this quake have been related to Tuesday's LA quake?\n\nIt’s very unlikely the Japanese earthquake was related to the magnitude 5.2 earthquake that struck northwest of Los Angeles on Tuesday night, but not impossible, USGS said. That quake has resulted in more than 270 aftershocks so far, though all have been smaller.\n\nEarthquakes that occur large distances apart can be linked, by the seismic waves passing through the earth’s crust, said Tom Parsons, a research geophysicist with USGS.\n\n“We see it around the world,” he said. “They could increase the water pressure within a fault, or the shaking could trigger another fault that’s close to slipping,” he said.\n\nSuch events, called “dynamic triggering,” tend to happen within a day or two after the initial earthquake. But even when it does happen, they tend to be very minor, no more than magnitude 1 and 2, Parsons said.\n\n“The likelihood of the Los Angeles earthquake having an impact in Japan is pretty small,” he said. “It’s typically the larger earthquakes that can trigger longer waves that pass through the crust.”\n\nGiven the large number of earthquakes that occur each day around the world – more than 1,300 are detectable every day – the number of dynamically triggered temblors is quite small, he said.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

There was a live-stream screening at the island’s Dreamland Theater that night that drew 250 patrons, many of whom reacted loudly to the film, according to Thayer.\n\nHallmark Channel will next show the film at 8 a.m. Dec. 8, and it’s due to play again at various times through the month.\n\nWhile the island remains the story’s setting, the movie was actually filmed in Canada — including on the Sunshine Coast of Gibsons, British Columbia, according to online and social media reports. Some of Thayer’s Facebook fans clearly didn’t agree with that decision-making, with many over the past couple of weeks protesting “The movie should have been filmed on Nantucket!”\n\nNew Christmas movie filmed in Falmouth:Romantic 'Cape Cod Christmas' TV movie premieres as stars ride in Falmouth's holiday parade\n\nBut Thayer was not part of that choice. The author did not respond to an interview request from the Times, but said in a Facebook Live talk with fans just before Thanksgiving that a film company had twice taken a yearlong \"option\" to turn “Let It Snow” into a movie, and the next thing she heard was when “Nantucket Noel” was in production.\n\n“I had no say after I signed the contract of what was in the movie and I had no communication with anyone at all,” she said.\n\nThayer noted during the chat that there is a shot of Brant Point in the movie, but joked about the non-Nantucket-like pine trees that can be seen across the water in some beach scenes. The lighthouse that figures prominently in the film does have the distinctive red and white striping of Sankaty Head Light.\n\nWhat Nancy Thayer likes about the movie\n\nThe author said she particularly liked two plot additions in the movie — the viewing of a holiday boat parade and a Snow Ball event — that she wished she’d thought of for the book. She also approved of the movie’s casting, particularly Payton Lepinski as enthusiastic young Wink. Thayer called it “a little iffy,” though, that in “Nantucket Noel,” Wink is the daughter of the son of the mean landlord rather than the son's niece, as in the “Let It Snow” book.\n\n“Wink was right on,” though, Thayer said about being excited by the movie depiction. “Wink was my favorite character. When I saw just a picture of her, I was thrilled. … Wink just came into my mind and started the book and suddenly there she was (in the movie) and she was real.”\n\nThayer also singled out Bruce Dawson for praise in playing rich landlord Oscar, who is Wink’s grandfather who moves to Nantucket and starts making changes. “I thought he was excellent, he was so much the character,” Thayer said on Facebook Live about Dawson.\n\nWhen writing the book, she said, she had based that character on wealthy people who move to Nantucket and tear things down and don’t become involved with the community. While some invest in local nonprofits and are part of the island, others are hardly seen, she said.\n\nA staffer at Mitchell's Book Corner on Nantucket, whom Thayer says has beautiful hair, inspired lead Christina. In \"Nantucket Noel,” Christina is played by Sarah Powell, a Canadian actress who portrays Abigail Pershing on Hallmark Channel’s “The Good Witch” series, and has appeared on other TV shows, including “Schitt’s Creek.”\n\nChristina's love interest of Andy is played by Trevor Donovan, best known as Teddy Montgomery in the CW’s “90210.” Donovan is a veteran of Hallmark movies, including “Marry Me at Christmas” and “SnowComing,” as well as “USS Christmas” for the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel.\n\nLongtime author and Nantucket resident\n\nThayer has lived on Nantucket year-round for more than three decades, and is active in the literary scene, including leading a discussion this week at the Nantucket Atheneum with Lynne Reeves, author of “The Dangers of an Ordinary Night.” Thayer is due to be signing her own books this weekend as part of the Nantucket Stroll holiday festivities.\n\nShe has written about three dozen novels in 40 years, including “Girl of Summer,” “Summer House,” “Surfside Sisters,” “The Hot Flash Club,” “Beachcombers,” “Island Girls” and “The Guest Cottage.” In 2015, Thayer was awarded the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award for Mainstream Fiction.\n\nHer “Family Reunion” novel was published in May, and “Summer Love” is due next spring. Previous holiday releases include “A Very Nantucket Christmas: Two Holiday Novels,” featuring “A Nantucket Christmas” and “An Island Christmas.”\n\n“All my novels are about family and friendships, which I believe are the foundation of a happy, if complicated, life,” she says on her Amazon.com author page. Her website describes her books — translated into multiple languages — as focusing on “the mysteries and romance of families and relationships: marriage and friendships, divorce and love, custody and step parenting, family secrets and private self-affirmation, the quest for independence and the normal human hunger for personal connections.”\n\n'Fikry' movie:'Big Bang Theory' star Kunal Nayyar is filming on Cape Cod\n\nDuring her Facebook Live chat, Thayer noted that her Christmas books are specifically about the importance of community.\n\n“Nantucket really does have a strong community. We’re so small in the winter … especially at a place like the grocery store, it’s wonderful because we run into people we know,” she said. Noting how the population more than doubles in the summer, she said the island is “much more of a community in the winter when we’re all frozen here and a gale is blowing and we can’t get off-island on a plane or a boat.”\n\nOne fan asked during the Facebook Live session why Hallmark Channel changed the name of Thayer’s book. The author said she was happy that “Nantucket Noel” specifies the island location, but the main reason was repetition. Hallmark, the behemoth of the wildly popular feel-good Christmas TV-movie craze, had already used the title “Let It Snow” for another film in 2013.\n\nContact Kathi Scrizzi Driscoll at kdriscoll@capecodonline.com.

Its effects could be chilling ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIf 2020 renewed calls for racial equality as Black Lives Matter protests exploded throughout Europe, 2021 brought in the backlash as parts of the political establishment waged a so-called “war against woke.”\n\nStripped of its original meaning of a person being awake to progressive issues, “woke” has been appropriated from the Black vernacular and turned into a political lightning rod in the West’s culture wars. It is now used pejoratively by lawmakers and pundits from both left and right, criticizing the perceived excesses of social and racial justice movements.\n\nThe politicization of the word, which has seen degrees of success in the United States, has bolstered political resistance to calls for more equality in Europe. The amorphous term has also been interpreted differently, depending on where it is deployed.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, woke is used to “describe anything that could previously [be] described as ‘politically correct,’” Evan Smith, a visiting fellow at Australia’s Flinders University and author of “No Platform: A History of Anti-Fascism and the Limits of Free Speech,” told CNN. The term is “used to describe a broad range of ideas [and] movements concerned with social justice,” including anti-racism, intersectional feminism, trans rights and critical histories of the British empire, he said.\n\nCultural institutions and academics have been targeted by members of the ruling Conservative Party for supporting those movements. In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson accused a charity set up in the name of Winston Churchill of trying to “airbrush” the “giant achievements” of the former wartime leader.\n\nThe charity’s mistake? Being accused in rightwing tabloids of being “woke,” for changing its name from the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust to The Churchill Fellowship and acknowledging that Churchill’s views on race would not be accepted today.\n\n“The Prime Minister has always been clear that whilst it’s legitimate to examine Britain’s history and we should aim to educate people about all aspects of our complex past, both good and bad, and not erase them,” the spokesperson said at the time according to PA Media. “We need to focus on addressing the present, and not attempt to rewrite the past and get sucked into the never-ending debate about which well-known historical figures are sufficiently pure or politically correct to remain in public view.”\n\nThese anti-woke government interventions have power. They “sharpen the public’s sense of moral purpose and help to galvanise voters in a country they perceive to be under siege,” wrote Nesrine Malik in the left-of-center newspaper, the Guardian, in October. “They include the defunding of academic institutions and museums, and even interfering in the appointment of senior personnel at the BBC.”\n\nMany in the French establishment view “woke” as a heinous US import of theories on race, post-colonialism and gender, which they say pose a risk to French values and identity, Samuel Hayat, a politics research fellow at French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), told CNN.\n\nA protester holds a banner on Champ de Mars, in Paris on June 6, 2020, as part of Black Lives Matter protests in the city. GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe term gained traction among French politicians and its press in 2021, say French observers. In May, Elizabeth Moreno, French President Emmanuel Macron’s party diversity minister, told Bloomberg that “woke culture is something very dangerous, and we shouldn’t bring it to France.” When asked in August whether “wokism [is] a just cause, in your opinion” by weekly political magazine Le Point, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is the socialist candidate in the upcoming presidential elections, said: “it is very important that journalists shed light on these emerging movements, but I will not be campaigning on them.”\n\nWhen a major French dictionary included a gender-inclusive pronoun in its online edition in November, French lawmaker François Jolivet, from Macron’s party, called the dictionary’s authors on Twitter “militants of a cause that has nothing to do with France: #wokisme.”\n\n“Woke is seen as a threat that comes from a society thought to be multicultural and violent and does not have the same values on secularism that France does,” Hayat said.\n\nThe word plays against the French egalitarian, anti-elitist mindset, said Hayat, placing all the theories someone might struggle to understand, such as intersectional feminism, “into a single phenomenon that came from outside France.”\n\nAs Franco-American relations plunged to new lows this fall over a security deal the US forged in secret with the UK and Australia, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer opened a think tank to uphold French values against what he described as “wokeism.”\n\nSpeaking to France’s Le Monde newspaper about his think tank, Blanquer said “wokeism” is an ideology that “fragments and divides, and has conquered certain political, media and academic circles.” He added that the backlash to “wokeism” helped “bring Donald Trump to power; France and its youth must escape this.”\n\nNew bogeyman\n\nAccording to Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar from Toulouse Capitole University, woke’s arrival in France’s culture wars is part of a wider reaction among members of Macron’s party, La République en Marche (LREM), against left-wing and progressive views, rearing its head after the brutal murder of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020.\n\nPaty’s death followed multiple Islamic terrorist attacks on French soil. But the French government’s response to his beheading opened up a full-scale culture war over secularism, freedom of speech and Islamophobia as the country’s interior minister closed a Muslim group that tracked anti-Muslim hate crime.\n\nThat period also saw “Islamo-leftism” – a controversial yet ill-defined far-right term accusing left-wing academics and activists of enabling Islamic extremism or terrorism – enter the mainstream political discourse as Education Minister Blanquer blamed it for “wreaking havoc” in universities.\n\nHe was backed by 100 academics who, in an open letter to Le Monde, blamed imported “indigenist [sic], racialist, and ‘decolonial’ ideologies,” in French universities for “nourishing hatred of the ‘Whites’ and of France.”\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron is seen at a December 13, 2021, press conference, months before the country's presidential election. Atilla Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBy the start of 2021, France’s Minister of Higher Education Frédérique Vidal announced the launch of an investigation into French academic research on CNews, a French channel that has been compared to Fox News. It would look “at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide,” while singling out colonialism and race studies, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe French research organization Vidal tasked with launching the inquiry agreed to carry out the research. It however noted that Islamo-leftism was not a scientific term and condemned “attempts to delegitimize different fields of research, such as postcolonial studies, intersectional studies,” Centre national de la recherche scientifique [CRNS] wrote in a press release.\n\nConflating academics and researchers with Islamic extremism amounts to McCarthyism, said Alouane, referring to the anti-Communist crusade in the early 1950s by US Sen. Joe McCarthy.\n\nWeaponizing woke is another attempt at bringing academics, researchers and human rights activists to heel, say critics.\n\n“This is a witchhunt against people who question the status quo,” Alouane added. “Instead of trying to make things better, to tackle issues related to discrimination, racial profiling, and the history of French colonization … these academics [and] researchers are considered to be a threat to so-called Republican values.”\n\nIt also raises questions about academic freedoms, Hayat told CNN. France only needs to look at how Hungarian leaders chipped away at its education sector, banning gender studies in colleges and forcing the Central European University (CEU) out of the country for failing to comply with their nationalist worldview.\n\nWhile crude racial stereotypes over genetics and skin color are frowned on in mainstream contemporary discourse, terms like wokeism and Islamo-leftism serve to reinforce dog whistles such as, “they do not belong to our culture. They do not abide by our Christian values,” Alouane told CNN. “It is just neo-racism.”\n\nThe anti-woke discourse comes just months ahead of France’s presidential election, where the main ideological threat to Macron comes from the right and far right, not the supposed woke left, said Alouane.\n\nAccording to some polls, Macron may end up facing off against either far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen or the rightwing Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse in the second round of voting.\n\nAnti-woke rhetoric may be part of an effort to neutralize Macron’s right-wing opponents. It is an effort Alouane finds ironic. “The funny thing is, if a far-right candidate makes it to the second round, we will [be told] to save the Republic against the far right – even though this administration has been playing with far-right ideologies the whole time,” she said.\n\nChilling effect\n\nAs in France, many experts say the British government’s anti-woke crusade is aimed at making electoral gains.\n\nAided by right-wing elements of the British media, Johnson’s government has used the so-called “war on woke” as an opportunity to score points with their mainly English and Brexit-supporting electorate – some of whom switched allegiance from the opposition Labour Party at the 2019 general election.\n\n“It is fertile territory for the Conservatives as they are pressing a button that has been pressed a few decades now in regards [denouncements of] political correctness,” Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, told CNN.\n\nIt also places Labour in a difficult position as its leader, Keir Starmer, attempts to “shake off the ‘far left’ tag” the party gained under his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, author Evan Smith said.\n\nJohnson’s culture war tugs at the split in Labour, between its socially conservative members, who think the party is too preoccupied with identity politics, rather than class, and its younger and more diverse base, who are happy for Starmer to do more, say experts.\n\nHistory has been the main battleground, where the Conservative government pits patriotism against any attempt to reckon with Britain’s colonial past.\n\nIt is a narrative that has played out in the education sector, which has seen a government-picked commission release a race report that fended off calls to “decolonize” Britain’s schooling curriculum. Instead, it advocated for “a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modeled African/Britain.”\n\n“British history is not solely one of imperial imposition – Commonwealth history and literature reveals a more complex picture, in which ideas traveled in multiple directions, cultures mixed and positive relations formed that today underpin diaspora around the world, which many ethnic minority children in the UK will feel part of,” the report wrote. Critics accused the report of being a whitewash that puts a positive spin on slavery.\n\nSpeaking to the House of Commons last year, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said “any school which teaches these elements of critical race theory as fact, or which promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views is breaking the law.”\n\nBoris Johnson's government has announced plans to combat so-called \"cancel culture\" in universities. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe government has not shied away from threats of intervention when cultural institutions follow progressive causes. If they “go too woke, they risk going broke,” Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said in October, reiterating his warning that such institutions could be defunded if they cave to “an aggressive brigade” of social justice activists.\n\nIn the last 18 months, heritage charity the National Trust faced threats to its funding from Conservative lawmakers for exploring its properties’ links to slavery and colonialism, and the Royal Museums Greenwich, in London, found itself under the microscope when the government reportedly refused to reappoint a trustee who advocated decolonizing school curriculums.\n\nThe Museums Association, which represents thousands of people working in the sector, warned of “a climate of fear” among “museums and museum staff, especially those working on subjects relating to Britain’s imperial past,” in response to a February meeting between museums, heritage bodies and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS], which Dowden headed at the time. “We support the rights of everyone working on these issues to do so free of interference, threats and intimidation,” the Museums Association added.\n\nThe BBC has also come under scrutiny from Conservative lawmakers calling for the license fee, which funds the broadcaster, to be scrapped.\n\n“A lot of Conservatives don’t like the state funding of a media company, and they think the BBC crowds out sympathetic broadcasters,” Bale said. “The whole anti-woke agenda to some extent is cover to move BBC from a license fee model to a subscriber-based one.”\n\nThis atmosphere can have a chilling effect on cultural institutions that may feel compelled to think twice about what programs they support or which people they hire. This is alleged to have played out at the BBC, when media executive Marcus Ryder’s job application was reportedly blocked due to his support of anti-racism initiatives. The BBC has strenuously denied those reports.\n\nSupporting anti-racism causes should not be an impartiality issue, Ryder told CNN. “What the BBC needs to do is re-examine its [impartiality] guidelines and decide how it should define ‘controversial’ and whether that can be independent of party politics,” he said. “And it needs to see how this framing works with people whose very existence sits outside the ‘normative standards’ – and this can apply to gender, race, sexuality, etc.”\n\nA BBC spokesperson told CNN that “impartiality is a core value of the BBC and something we apply to all our news coverage.” The spokesperson added: “The BBC plays an important role in informing and facilitating debate about subjects of public interest, some of which are divisive. That being said, the BBC is not impartial on racism or any other characteristics protected by law.”\n\nThe policing of institutions by culture warriors acts as a way to undermine the real, lived experience of minorities. It allows for concerns about racism, transphobia or violence against women to be framed as not being of material concern to ordinary people, Neema Begum, a British politics professor at the University of Nottingham, told CNN. The long-term effect of this is just “more polarization,” she added.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nBritain’s anti-woke crusade sometimes borders on the farcical – from a “woke watch” segment on GB News, a British television news channel critics say was set up to find an audience amid the culture wars, to a lawmaker bemoaning that civil servants are still “woke-ing from home.”\n\nNor has every skirmish against social justice movements been a win for the government. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused England’s national football team of engaging in “gesture politics” for taking the knee before its matches in a protest against racism, and refused to condemn those who booed the players for doing so.\n\nBritish Home Secretary Priti Patel accused the England football team of \"gesture politics\" for taking the knee before matches. Mike Egerton/PA/Getty Images\n\nBut the tactic backfired when the country rallied around the team after some of its players experienced racial abuse online in the aftermath of England’s Euro 2020 final defeat in July. By the end of the Euros, polling showed most England football fans supported the team taking the knee.\n\n“You don’t get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as ‘Gesture Politics’ & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we’re campaigning against, happens,” England footballer Tyrone Mings wrote in a Twitter post responding to a tweet by Patel condemning the post-final racism.\n\n“It is clear the British public cares quite a lot [about] the equalities agenda, and it is quite easy for that kind of [government] mobilization to backfire,” Christopher Bertram, emeritus professor of social and political philosophy at Bristol University, told CNN.\n\nIt also shows that while the anti-woke messaging works with their base, British society is getting more multi-ethnic, tolerant and woke, Bale said.\n\n“The Conservatives are going to have to make a decision if they carry on railing against the way society is going,” Bale said. “There is a long-term risk for them as it alienates [younger] future voters who they need to keep on side,” Bale added. “There is a limited number of grumpy, older White men to get off on this kind of stuff.”\n\nEven the 73-year-old grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames, has heard enough, calling the furor over the Churchill Trust “so sad and so pathetic” in an interview with the Times. “Apparently anyone who modernizes anything or does anything to remotely bring it up to date is ‘woke.’” he said. “It’s absolute b****cks.”", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/05/11/little-women-review-pbs-masterpiece-adaptation-maya-hawke-julie-walters/593994002/", "title": "'Little Women' review: PBS's new adaptation is a warm bath of love", "text": "Returning to the March family home is like collapsing into the arms of an old friend.\n\nWarm, idyllic and impeccably acted, PBS Masterpiece's new adaptation of Little Women (Sunday and May 20, 9 ET/PT, times may vary, ★★★ out of four) is a beautiful if slight interpretation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel about four sisters growing up poor in 19th-century Massachusetts.\n\nWe didn't need another adaption of the book, which has already been made into three films, including one in 1994 starring Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon. It's been brought to the stage and assigned to countless high-school English classes. But just because we don't need something sweet and comforting doesn't mean we shouldn't indulge. And Little Women is a welcome indulgence.\n\nThe three-hour miniseries hits all the major points that you love and remember: Amy (Kathryn Newton) burns Jo's (Maya Hawke) book, Beth (Annes Elwy) gets terribly sick with scarlet fever and Meg (Willa Fitzgerald) marries Mr. Brooke (Julian Morris). But the new version takes some liberties with its interpretations of the characters. Beth's shyness is portrayed as social anxiety, and she's often unable to venture outside her house. And because the actresses are all of similar ages, Amy's immaturity often comes off as entitled brattiness.\n\nOverall, the four young stars have great chemistry and give the adaptation verve and life. Hawke excels in the complicated and foundational role of Jo, the adventurous tomboy and de facto protagonist. The daughter of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman comes out swinging in her debut role, imbuing Jo with a quiet energy and a desperation for something more than her small life. Although she often looks eerily like her mother, Hawke quickly proves herself more than just another famous daughter (and you'll soon see her in Netflix's Stranger Things).\n\nNeed a break?

The actors spit wordy, period dialogue with delight, and the lazy, airy pacing and jingly score are both fitting and easily identifiable for any Masterpiece devotee.\n\nFans more recently acquainted with the book or with the 1994 movie might be perturbed by the slight changes, but going in cold is preferable.

From its immortal opening sentence, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,\" Pride & Prejudice has enchanted readers around the world, in every language, for 200 years.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why the story of how proud, rich Mr. Darcy and pert, poor Elizabeth Bennet fall in love continues to win our hearts.\n\n1. It's the ultimate \"happy ever after\" tale.Pride & Prejudice established the template for an infinity of romance novels, yet no subsequent love story has ever come close to equaling the delights of the original. In P&P, opposites repel then attract: Mr. Darcy is sullen and arrogant. Elizabeth is vivacious and charming. He is rich, she is poor. He is madly in love, she can't bear him. In a scene both hilarious and dramatic, Elizabeth squashes Mr. Darcy's massive pride when she rejects his first proposal. To win her, Darcy is forced to change, to become more kind and polite. But Elizabeth also changes, though her journey from prejudice is less visible.\n\n2.It's fun. The plot of P&P scarcely seems to be the stuff of comedy. Here are five unmarried girls in rural England who will face poverty once their improvident father kicks the bucket since his estate must pass to a male heir. If they can't snag husbands, their career options involve downwardly mobile humiliations such as working as governesses or paid companions to the wealthy. And yet the novel, brimming with sparkling dialogue, \"is a pure joy to read,\" as Anna Quindlen once put it. Perhaps it is Elizabeth's father, Mr. Bennet, who best explains its appeal: \"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?\"\n\n3. It's the rom-com of all rom-coms. Which is why P&P has been adapted for screens big and small around the world. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth have been portrayed by Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson (1940) and Matthew Macfadyen and the radiant Keira Knightley (2005). There is even a 2004 Bollywood musical, Bride and Prejudice. But for many fans, the ultimate adaptation is the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle. Her co-star Colin Firth may have won an Oscar playing a British monarch, but to Darcy fans, he is a god thanks to a certain scene involving a wet white shirt. These days, you can watch a Web adaptation on YouTube called The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which stars Ashley Clements as Lizzie.\n\n4. Sex, lies and runaway teens. The next time someone dismisses Pride & Prejudice as a fussy old story about the breeding habits of early 19th-century Brits, point out that the novel's villain, George Wickham, would probably be arrested today as a serial pedophile. An Army officer in his 20s, Wickham is a smooth operator who tries to seduce underage girls for fun and profit. Though he fails to lure Mr. Darcy's 15-year-old heiress sister into marriage, Wickham succeeds in deflowering and shacking up with Elizabeth's 16-year-old sister, Lydia, without benefit of clergy, thanks to her \"animal spirits.\"\n\n5. P&P isn't just \"how to marry a millionaire, Regency style.\" You can divide the world into two groups: mad romantics who adore those passionate Brontë tales about women yearning for tormented psychos like Heathcliff, and more pragmatic souls who admire Elizabeth Bennet's decision to marry for love and money. Readers know that Austen, who never married, disapproves of Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Lucas' decision to marry a \"conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man\" simply for money. Mr. Darcy, however, wouldn't be Mr. Darcy without the ka-ching of 10,000 pounds a year and the big estate up north. Elizabeth herself jokes about her change of heart regarding Darcy: \"I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\n\n6. Before the Kardashians, there were the Bennets. Reality TV didn't invent miserable, weird families. Just look at Lizzie's parents, the supremely ill-matched Ma and Pa Bennet. When not locked in his library reading, Mr. Bennet entertains himself by teasing and tormenting his whiny dimwit of a wife in front of their offspring. The deepest bond in the novel isn't romantic love, it's affection between siblings. (Austen adored her own sister Cassandra, who, in turn, encouraged Austen's writing.) Even when Elizabeth dislikes Mr. Darcy, she admits he's an outstanding brother to his little sister. And it's sibling solidarity, not rivalry, with Elizabeth Bennet and her older sister, the head-turning beauty Jane. Indeed, it is a worried Elizabeth rushing to help Jane, fallen sick while dining with wealthy new neighbors, that captured the heart of British writer Martin Amis, who wrote: \"Impelled by sibling love, Elizabeth strides off through the November mud to Netherfield, that fortress of fashion, privilege, and disdain. She arrives unannounced, and scandalously unaccompanied, 'with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.' By now the male reader's heart is secure (indeed, he is down on one knee).\"\n\n7. Back then, well-off people's purpose really was to eat, drink and be merry. Name the one activity that Mr. Darcy, Bingley, Sir Lucas and Mr. Bennet all avoid: Work! They visit the ladies. Hunt birds. Attend balls. Ride horses. Travel. The one worker bee in the bunch — Elizabeth's uncle Mr. Gardiner — is socially handicapped because of that icky thing called his job. Even military life appears to be a social club for swanky young studs — pretty remarkable since P&P was published at time when Napoleon was rampaging through Europe.\n\n8. Now, as then, we choose to see what we want.First Impressions was Austen's original title. Though far less catchy, it does convey perfectly Austen's important message: First impressions are often wrong. For example, Darcy's little sister is often mistaken for proud when she's simply painfully shy. Other first impressions are dangerous. P&P's one truly evil character is the slick seducer Wickham, who charms everyone, even Elizabeth, who prides herself on being nobody's fool.\n\n9. Hypocrisy is always good for a laugh. Some of Austen's funniest and sharpest scenes involve hypocrites. There's Mr. Collins, the clergyman. Upon learning that his teenage cousin Lydia is living in sin, this man of God writes a letter to Mr. Bennet, noting that \"the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison\" and closes by urging, \"Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection forever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.\" Nice. ​And while Mrs. Bennet embarrasses her family with her loud voice and silly ways, she's Emily Post compared with the snobbish Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the novel's rudest character.\n\n10. Technology might change, but human nature remains the same. Give cellphones to the youngest Bennet daughters — the boy-crazy shopaholics Kitty and Lydia — and they would fit right in at any high school. Their father is every Baby Boomer dad ignoring both his upside-down mortgage and his out-of-control kids. The one homely Bennet female, Mary, is the 19th-century version of an insecure, overachieving nerd.\n\nIn the end, although Austen crafted her characters with a quill pen dipped in ink, they have remained fresh, instantly recognizable and fascinating for 200 years. Whether people read P&P on a print page, a tablet or some future gadget, the love story of how Mr. Darcy won Elizabeth Bennet, will, no doubt, continue to captivate readers for another two centuries.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/14/anna-karenina-keira-knightley-joe-wright/1675587/", "title": "Knightley, Wright have a long history with history", "text": "Susan Wloszczyna, USA TODAY\n\nKnightley and Wright have now made three movies together: 'Pride & Prejudice,' 'Atonement,' 'Anna Karenina'\n\n\"It feels like we've grown up together,\" director Wright says\n\nWright credits Knightley with proposing they make 'Anna Karenina' together\n\nTORONTO — Ever since Lillian Gish and D.W. Griffith joined forces on dozens of silent classics, film history has been filled with notable actress-director teams who conjured magic multiple times.\n\nA real-life romance can kindle such cinematic couplings: Woody Allen with Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. Ingmar Bergman with Liv Ullmann. Tim Burton with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nThen there are platonic partnerships between artists who are sublimely simpatico: Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich. George Cukor and Katharine Hepburn. Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman.\n\nBut few current duos have proven as durable as Joe Wright, a brash purveyor of visual panache, and Keira Knightley, the stunner who ranks among Hollywood's most bankable female talents.\n\nOpening Friday is their third and most daring collaboration, a sumptuously audacious adaptation of Anna Karenina that sets most of Tolstoy's chronicle of love and betrayal among Russia's 19th-century aristocracy inside a decaying theater. Considering that scenes include a heart-stopping horse race at full speed across a stage, it is little wonder that the adjective \"bold\" figures heavily in early reviews.\n\nThe British twosome — a self-proclaimed show-off who got his start at a puppet theater owned by his parents and a child performer who came of age as a soccer player in 2002's Bend It Like Beckham — for some reason gravitate toward literary-based period pieces. Not that Wright would describe them that way. \"I like to think of them as being fantasies,\" he says. \"I'm not interested in historical re-enactment. They allow us to dream and think in more expressive ways.\"\n\nWright declares his most frequent leading lady to be \"my sister in celluloid,\" and the sibling-like connection that was forged in 2004 during the making of an emotionally unbound interpretation of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice appears to have inspired some of their best work.\n\n\"It feels like we've grown up together,\" says the filmmaker, 40, whose London home is just a few doors down from where 27-year-old Knightley resides. \"We've seen each other through some good times and some bad times, and that's a lovely process. I like the idea of working with someone who has seen me at my weakest and also with success.\"\n\nNot that they always agree. Both have been upfront about their heated debates. That includes much discussion over which role Knightley would take in their second effort, the 2007 World War II drama Atonement, which earned seven Oscar nominations, including best picture.\n\nWright's preference for glamorous Cecilia, whose posh mannerisms are in stark contrast to Knightley's girlish portrayal of free-spirited Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice, won out and allowed the stylish actress to make a lasting impression in a showstopper of an emerald-green gown.\n\n\"He understands what I'm talking about,\" the actress says. \"We do argue occasionally, and like siblings, you kind of know that you have to get over the argument because you're not going to stop being siblings. And so it's never the end of the world when you argue. There is a trust in the fact that underneath anything that is going on, you're still going to love each other.\"\n\nShe stands by her Mr. Wright even if her characters are sometimes subjected to abuse and worse. \"We have worked three times, and he has killed me twice,\" she observes. \"We've done three commercials, and he had me beaten up in one of them.\"\n\nAdds Wright, \"But you've made a lot of love, though.\"\n\nShe nods. \"A lot of love.\"\n\nBut don't get Knightley started on the countless hours of rehearsal time she invested in learning Anna Karenina's intricate dance numbers, in which arms intertwine and flutter provocatively.\n\n\"Keira still hates me for that,\" says Wright with a wicked laugh.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" she concedes, \"even though he cut another dance sequence that took ages.\"\n\nParallels in their private lives abound. Both have struggled with dyslexia. Both became involved in long-term relationships and subsequently broke up with cast members from Pride & Prejudice: Knightley with Rupert Friend (TV's Homeland) and Wright with Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise, out Dec. 21).\n\nAnd they each have entered a settling-down phase. In 2010, Wright married Anoushka Shankar, a Grammy-nominated musician and daughter of celebrated sitarist and Beatles associate Ravi Shankar. Their son, Zubin, turns 2 in February. Knightley became engaged to her own musician, James Righton of the Klaxons, in May.\n\nTheir influence on each other even extends into their off-hours, such as in wardrobe choices. Today, they are a vision in black (her Celine shift) and blue (his natty dark denim suit).\n\n\"I'm wearing John Pearse,\" says Wright, dropping the name of the tailor who once co-owned the notorious '60s boutique Granny Takes a Trip. \"Jacqueline Durran (the costumer for Pride & Prejudice and Atonement) made an exquisite denim dress for Keira and I was quite jealous of it. I felt I wanted a denim suit. I didn't think a dress would suit me.\"\n\nSays Knightley, with a saucy smile, \"Oh, I don't know ...\"\n\nThey have come a long way since everyone from Austen cultists to Colin Firth fans (who consider the actor to be the definitive Mr. Darcy) questioned the wisdom of attempting to top the six-part 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride andPrejudice a decade later. Back then, Knightley was known for supporting roles in the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure and the ensemble comedy Love Actually.\n\nHowever, Pride & Prejudice proved to be her entree into the big leagues after it earned her her first Oscar nomination. Wright's reward? A brand-new career path. His feature-directing debut allowed him to move on from the TV projects he had been doing in England to being sought after for theatrical movies.\n\nNo small feat, Wright notes. \"My producer, Paul Webster, on Pride & Prejudice did keep saying to me, 'One in 10 first-time directors get to make another film.' \"\n\nKnightley laughs. \"Nothing like working under pressure.\"\n\nHe glances fondly at her. \"I think I owe my career to Keira, really.\"\n\nKnightley gently scoffs: \"Bull---- you do.\"\n\nTim Bevan, whose production company, Working Title, has produced all of Wright's vehicles with Knightley, thinks it is a match made in costume-drama heaven for both parties.\n\n\"Joe brings out the best in Keira,\" he says, while noting that the actress often gets bashed by hometown critics for being a little too one-note. \"He can extract an emotional performance out of her that others are unable to do. He treats her with intellectual respect. Every actor has their tricks and looks, and he knocks that out of her. He insists on proper honesty on-set.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wright benefits from Knightley's charismatic wattage. \"The reason I got him to see her on Pride is that I pointed out that she is a movie star, an English movie star,\" Bevan says. \"What that does for him is to get these movies made.\"\n\nWhile Wright likes to say that Knightley was the one who brought up the possibility of doing Anna Karenina together while making Atonement, she claims it wasn't so simple.\n\n\"We were having a discussion of great female characters,\" she says. \"This was one. He remembers me reading it during Atonement. I thought I had read it earlier. But Anna Karenina was at the forefront of my mind. We also discussed Hedda Gablerand Antigone.\"\n\nShe says Wright called her two years later and asked, \"Do you remember that talk? Do you fancy doing it?\"\n\nBoth feel she is the perfect age now to pull off a role as mature as an aristocratic woman who tosses away her marriage and her standing in society after falling for a dashing philanderer.\n\n\"Keira was 18 when we made Pride, and when we made Atonement, she was 21,\" he says. \"A lot has happened to her since, and that informs your understanding of the world, eventually. Keira is a proper grown-up now, and it really is a proper grown-up performance. She was incredibly powerful when she was 18 and 21, but it wasn't as focused or as direct. And that's changed. And I've changed, too.\"\n\nSuddenly, there is a knock on the door, and a tray is brought in stacked with plates of sushi and bowls of miso soup.\n\nContinuing his thought about change, Wright jokes, \"I now eat sushi.\"\n\nSays Knightley, \"You now get sushi brought to you.\"\n\nWright does want to clarify a wrong impression that arose during the film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. \"Everyone keeps asking me, 'Is she your muse?' She is not my muse. My wife is my muse.\"\n\n\"That is a very good muse to have,\" Knightley concurs.\n\nStill, he can't help but act somewhat peeved when the actress discusses an upcoming project, a reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise (including The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games) in which Chris Pine takes over the role of author Tom Clancy's CIA agent, previously played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. Knightley is cast as Ryan's wife.\n\nWright can hardly wait to inquire, \"Who is directing?\"\n\n\"Kenneth Branagh,\" she answers, \"who is also playing the baddie.\"\n\nWright, who next tackles a stage revival of Trelawny of the \"Wells\" at London's Donmar Warehouse, is amused by his own overreaction to the news. \"I get a little bit jealous when I hear that. You are supposed to wait for me in a field of lavender.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/07/18/10-must-see-highlights-sherlock-holmes-exhibition-science-museum-oklahoma/7394534002/", "title": "10 must-see highlights in 'Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition' at ...", "text": "The game's afoot at Science Museum Oklahoma.\n\nAn encompassing interactive experience based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's (1859-1930) iconic books, \"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition\" is inviting aspiring investigators of all ages to explore the science, history and methods of the world's most famous fictional detective.\n\nDeveloped in close cooperation with the Conan Doyle Estate, the exhibition is on view through Sept. 6 on the museum's second floor.\n\n\"'Sherlock Holmes' is an incredibly immersive and thoughtful environment. You're definitely seeing the influence of the Conan Doyle Estate with this partnership,\" said Sherry Marshall, Science Museum Oklahoma president.\n\nGeoffrey Curley, the exhibit's designer and content developer, said Science Museum Oklahoma is the ideal place to showcase Sherlock.\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes, he was an investigator, he was a scientist, he had a ton of medical theory behind him as a character. But it all came down to the scientific method, and he used it in every single case,\" Curley said. \"The scientific method is used in forensic science, it's used in everyday science, it's used whenever we have a question about anything that's surrounding us.\"\n\nThe immersive \"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition\" requires an additional ticket beyond regular museum admission. It includes hands-on activities suitable for all ages. But the centerpiece of the exhibit is a Sherlockian mystery to solve, and that is recommended for visitors 7 and older. The suggested time to explore the exhibit in full is about one hour.\n\nHere are 10 highlights to look for in \"Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition.\"\n\n1. The sleuth's inspiration\n\nAlthough Sherlock Holmes wasn't a real person, Conan Doyle based him on Dr. Joseph Bell, one of the astute professors he studied under at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in Scotland. Bell is depicted in a large portrait in the exhibition.\n\n\"You'll notice that he's clean-shaven, has very sharp eyes, kind of an eagle nose, short black hair, exactly how Sherlock Holmes is described,\" Curley said.\n\nThe exhibit also details how Bell's astounding skills at observation and dedication inspired his student.\n\n\"He (Conan Doyle) was a doctor himself. ... The center of medical innovation at the time was Edinburgh, and he was surrounded by these brilliant doctors and brilliant minds. And he applied that to his character as he was writing,\" Curley said.\n\n2. The 'Scarlet' letters\n\nAlong with collaborating closely with the Conan Doyle estate, Curley and his team worked with the Elmer L. Andersen Library at the University of Minnesota, which boasts one of the world's largest gatherings of material related to Sherlock Holmes. The library has loaned the exhibition a rare copy of the magazine \"Beeton's Christmas Annual\" for 1887, which featured Sherlock Holmes' rather inauspicious debut.\n\n\"'A Study in Scarlet' was the first story that Conan Doyle wrote with the Sherlock Holmes in it, and it was published as a Christmas annual, so sort of like a special holiday book. And when it came out, it was not that popular at the time. Sherlock hadn't really taken off, so a lot of people threw them out,\" Curley said, leaving few in existence today.\n\n3. The hole in the head\n\nSherlock Holmes couldn't solve crimes without data, and his creator couldn't write those twisty mysteries without physical evidence like the exhibit's real-life skull dramatically marred by a huge hole.\n\n\"That was a woman who was murdered with a blunt instrument,\" Curley said. \"This is an example of artifacts that Conan Doyle would have seen when he was studying to be a physician.\"\n\nAlthough forensic science is now taught at colleges like the University of Central Oklahoma, in Conan Doyle's day, that sort of training wasn't widely available.\n\n\"Forensic scientists at the time of Conan Doyle were mostly physicians anyway,\" Curley said. \"Doctors would use observation and comparison to see if there was damage to a particular body at a crime scene, how would it match. They wanted to be able to get an understanding of what a blunt force wound would look like, so if there was a crime that took place, they could go and compare them.\"\n\n4. Rare leaves from a 'Hound'\n\nConsidered one of the most famous and beloved novels ever written, 1902's \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" marked Conan Doyle's highly anticipated return to his most famous character after the author had killed off Holmes in the 1893 story \"The Final Problem.\"\n\nAs part of a promotional campaign when the book was published, the original manuscript was divided up into individual leaves. Book stores that ordered enough copies of the novel were sent one of the leaves to use for their displays.\n\n\"So, the leaves of the manuscript were all separated and scattered around the world. And who knows what people did with them: They hung up in their windows, they gave them to their kids, they burnt them. So, very few of these are united around the globe. So, these are two of the four leaves that the Andersen Library has,\" Curley said.\n\n\"What's really interesting about this is that Conan Doyle typically writes meticulously. He knows exactly what he's going to write before he puts it on paper. But with this one, you can see there are a lot of edits in here. So, this is a rare performance for Conan Doyle to have these edits. But they're just so fun to sort of see what he was thinking when he was writing and what was his mindset at that point in time when he was pulling this work together. So, these are really special pieces.\"\n\n5. The car from the 'Shadows'\n\nIn 2012, Guinness World Records awarded Sherlock Holmes the world record for the most portrayed literary human character in film and television, noting the fictional sleuth had been been depicted on screen more than 250 times.\n\nSince his creation in 1887, Curley said the character has been played by about 120 actors and counting, including luminaries like Sir Christopher Lee, Charlton Heston, Peter O'Toole, Christopher Plummer, Peter Cook, Roger Moore, John Cleese, Jonny Lee Miller, Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey Jr. \"Superman\" star Henry Cavill became the latest to portray the famous detective in Netflix's 2020 film \"Enola Holmes,\" about the sleuth's sister.\n\nThe exhibit includes props, costumes and memorabilia from the BBC series \"Sherlock,\" the CBS show \"Elementary\" and Guy Ritchie's \"Sherlock Holmes\" film franchise, including the prop car from the 2011 sequel \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\"\n\n\"The word 'Sherlock' is used as a synonym for detective. It's in our marketing and advertising, you see it in everyday conversation, but it's also really been applied to cultural innovations in writing, films, television, even games and toys,\" Curley said.\n\n6. The innovations of the past\n\nThe immersive exhibit has the feel of a vintage London train station and is set up like an exposition of various sciences, technologies and innovations of the day, from the photograph to the phonograph.\n\n\"The sweet spot for Sherlock Holmes is around 1885. ... At the end of the Industrial Revolution in London at the time, there were these huge innovations in technology that were happening,\" Curley said. \"Even though they're based in sort of a historic fashion, there's still the sciences that we use today in forensic science. So, everything we're teaching here applies to today's detective work.\"\n\n7. The news of the day\n\nMuch as cellphones have revolutionized modern life in the digital era, the exhibit delves into the sweeping changes in the way people communicated during Conan Doyle's day.\n\n\"The telegraph was a huge change. It was totally cutting edge. You're able to have publications of newspapers twice a day. You're able to get news from around the world within minutes, as opposed to within days. It really changed everything,\" Curley said.\n\n\"And it allowed for these sensational stories of crime and mystery to be broadcast on just immediately as they happened.\"\n\n8. The ill-advised ingredients\n\nAlthough it might initially seem out of place in an exhibition devoted to a famous fictional detective, the cosmetics aisle is arguably one of the most fascinating in the show.\n\nSherlock's knowledge of the natural world often proved essential to closing cases, especially since many beauty products popular around the turn of the 20th century were, in fact, hazardous to one's health.\n\n\"Cosmetics at that time were, of course, very fashionable. Women particularly liked to have the very pale skin and sort of the dewy eyes. And in order to get that look, which is a lovely, beautiful appearance, you'd use some really pretty toxic chemicals: arsenic, nightshade,\" Curley said. \"So, it turned out that poison was kind of the murder weapon of choice for women at that time.\"\n\n9. You know his methods\n\nAs Holmes might say, \"You know my methods, Watson,\" and the centerpiece of the exhibition is the chance to play detective, Sherlock style. Visitors are invited into Holmes' house, where they are tasked with helping him on a head-scratching case. Activities include examining a crime scene, heading into a mock-up slaughterhouse to study blood spatter and doing experiments with various plants and chemicals.\n\nPenned exclusively for the exhibition by award-winning writer and Conan Doyle biographer Daniel Stashower, the puzzle is a solid facsimile of the kind of crime Holmes himself might take on, requiring deductive reasoning, keen observation and maybe a little luck to figure out.\n\n'You're transported to Baker Street, you go into the office, you're doing these experiments, basically, the exact same way Sherlock Holmes would,\" Marshall said.\n\n10. The spot-on re-creation\n\nEven if you don't want to tackle the mystery, it's worth stepping into the sitting room of the exhibit's re-creation of Sherlock's London flat at 221B Baker Street.\n\n\"What's really interesting is that when Conan Doyle wrote the stories he was writing in Southsea. So, he was down in Portsmouth when he was writing. He didn't live in London, and as far as we know, he never actually set foot on Baker Street before he wrote about it. So, you'll notice the architecture in this particular room is what he wrote as opposed to what's factual. So, there was never a broad window in Baker Street ever,\" Curley said.\n\nBut historians knowledgeable about the Sherlock Holmes stories helped Curley and his team create a space that could rival even the most carefully crafted film or TV sets the character has inhabited.\n\n'Sherlock Holmes: The Exhibition'\n\nWhen: Through Sept. 6.\n\nWhere: Science Museum Oklahoma, 2020 Remington Place.\n\nAdmission: Exhibition tickets must be purchased in addition to general admission.

Did a friend recommend or forward this to you? If so, subscribe here. Have feedback? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey! Now, here’s Charles Curtis on the NFL doing away with its endzone slogans.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: the NFL has finally gotten rid of racism.\n\nWell, actually ... per USA TODAY Sports: The messaging we normally see in the end zone during NFL games will have \"Choose Love\" and \"It Takes All of Us\" for Super Bowl 59.\n\nMissing from end zones will be \"End Racism.\" Per NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, \"the choice of messages was made in response to several deadly tragedies throughout the United States since the start of the new year.\"\n\nThe tragedies McCarthy is referring to include the California wildfires and the Potomac plane crash in Washington, D.C. While they're obviously tragic, it's difficult to pinpoint a reason why they'd necessitate the removal of the NFL's slogans in this instance. One thing really doesn't have much to do with the other.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nIt was that message that was written starting in 2020 in end zones that always felt performative, in the same way that the league started fining players for doing the finger guns celebration.\n\nFor what it's worth, \"End Racism\" was written in the NFC title game in Philadelphia. But it's also worth pointing out that this comes in the middle of President Donald Trump fighting DEI initiatives and closing offices in the government aimed at diversity. Trump is reportedly aiming to be in attendance on Sunday, and we're talking about the same president who just blamed DEI for the plane and helicopter crash.\n\nEven if this is all a coincidence, it's not a good look with all of that swirling around. Frankly, taking away \"end racism\" in the face of the last few weeks is a bit of a slap in the face.\n\nWe do need to give the NFL some credit in the face of all of this: the league has been pouring money into combating racial and social injustice. So there's that! And that's so much more impactful than just two words written on a field.\n\nBut for \"end racism\" to disappear in the context of what's going on in recent weeks? It needs to be called out.\n\nReunited and it feels so good?\n\nKevin Durant might be a Golden State Warrior again soon, Mike Sykes writes. But...it wouldn't make much sense if this were to actually happen.\n\nHere's the deal: The Warriors have been calling around about \"every All-Star player\" they could think of, from LeBron James to Zion Williamson, trying to get Steph Curry some help. The player who seems to be the most available these days is Kevin Durant, who the Suns have reportedly insisted they're not trading.\n\nAccording to NBA insiders Marc Stein and Jake Fischer, however, there's a \"rising belief around the league\" that Durant can be moved.\n\nWhy? Because it's the only way for the Suns to acquire Jimmy Butler before the trade deadline on Thursday. Bradley Beal won't waive his no-trade clause so he's out of the question. A Durant deal could land Phoenix with the assets needed to get the Heat's star.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Why would you trade Durant just to get Jimmy Butler?\" Well, folks. There's no good answer to that question. Here's more from Stein:\n\n\"Why would the Suns want Butler if they no longer have Durant on the roster? No one asked by The Stein Line has been able to furnish a good answer to that question, but rumbles persist that a scenario that transports Butler from South Beach to the desert — with Durant moving back to the Bay Area — is indeed in play.\"\n\nIt doesn't make any sense. But, uh, I guess it's a thing. We'll see.\n\nTom Brady is free\n\nRemember all of those restrictions imposed on Tom Brady in his broadcast job because of his ownership role with the Raiders? Typically, he can't do simple things to prepare for the broadcast, like attend team practices, visit team facilities or even criticize officials during games.\n\nThe gloves are off for the Super Bowl, though. Well, kind of.

Here is a 39-year-old quarterback, a few years removed from four neck surgeries. He leads the NFL with 10 interceptions in six games, with just seven touchdown passes.\n\nBut this is Peyton Manning. A first-ballot hall of famer. The most prolific quarterback ever. His numbers are ridiculous.\n\nManning has passed for more than 70,000 yards over his career, an NFL-record 537 touchdowns, with five MVP awards.\n\n“You look at the MVPs, the Super Bowl victory, the countless records he holds,” linebacker Clay Matthews said. “I think it just goes to show the type of athlete that he is. It’s hard to come in year in and year out and live up to that standard. He’s managed to do that.”\n\nThose numbers can be intimidating for opposing defenses. So can his 14 Pro Bowls, and seven All-Pro mentions. For more than 15 years, he played the quarterback position as fine as it ever has been played. But this Peyton Manning, the one the Green Bay Packers will play Sunday night, isn’t that Peyton Manning.\n\nAll things Packers: Latest Green Bay Packers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThis Peyton Manning leads the NFL’s 29th-ranked offense. The Broncos went 23 straight possessions without finding the end zone earlier this month, a stretch of eight quarters.\n\nManning has thrown an interception in every game this season, with multiple picks in his past three games. For the first time since his rookie year, he has more interceptions than touchdowns six games into a season.\n\nStrip away the past two decades, all the accolades and accomplishments, the legacy. You’re left with an aging quarterback tired of answering questions about his twilight.\n\n“You could ask,” Manning said Wednesday during a round of questions about his health and diminished ability. “Once again, to talk about myself puts me in an uncomfortable position. I’m sure our trainer would be willing to do an open interview on the health of me and the entire team. Good luck getting that interview.\n\n“Actually, I feel pretty good.”\n\nManning will need to play pretty good this week.\n\nFor all the talk about Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers against a Broncos defense that may be the best in the NFL, this could be the matchup that matters. An aging Manning, with a slowed release and slower fastball, must survive a Packers defense that ranks first in the NFL with 16.8 points allowed per game and second with 23 sacks.\n\nEven in his prime, Manning was susceptible to the pass rush. That makes him no different than any other quarterback, Matthews noted. But Manning isn’t in his prime. Pressure him this week, and things could get ugly on national television.\n\n“Try to get him off his spot,” Matthews said. “We know Peyton is the type of player who, if he has time to sit in the pocket, he’s going to pick you apart. I think it puts extra emphasis on the fact that, him not taking many hits and sacks, but at the same time we need to do a good job of getting him off the spot. Getting him moving his feet, and hopefully we can take advantage of a few throws. That’s obviously a point of emphasis this week, and hopefully that comes to be.”\n\nIn his mind, Matthews said, he isn’t looking at Manning any differently than in the past. It’s dangerous to underestimate him, of course. Manning will always command respect.\n\nEven at his age, with his medical history, he can find unconventional ways to win a game.\n\n“I don’t think you can outthink him,” cornerback Casey Hayward said.\n\nAround the Packers’ locker room, defensive players referred to Manning in reverent tones. Many of them grew up watching the quarterback in Indianapolis, where he led the Colts to two Super Bowls, winning one. They realize Manning’s stature in the game’s history is larger than life, something legendary.\n\nThey’re also aware of Manning’s struggles.\n\n“I’m sure he wishes he had some throws back,” Matthews said. “And I’m sure he wishes he had more touchdowns and less interceptions, but that’s part of the deal. We’ve all had our ups and downs in our career, and I know a lot of people want to give him a hard time. Especially 39 (years old), and perhaps in his final year, final two years, whatever it may be.\n\n“You put on the tape, there’s some impressive throws that he possesses, and he’s made in critical parts of the game. I think a lot of people want to focus on that.”\n\nManning has had to change his weekly routine to stay fresh for Sundays. He has adapted to his age, Manning said, with regular “body maintenance” that was unnecessary as a younger player. He also takes fewer reps through the week. Manning no longer practices on Wednesdays, though he did this week with the Broncos coming off their bye.\n\nThe extra rest should help, physically and mentally. Which is why the Packers won’t expect anything less than Manning’s best, even if his best isn’t what it used to be.\n\n“He’s capable of doing anything and everything that he’s done in the past,” safety Micah Hyde said. “He’s just like any other quarterback – if you get pressure off him, make him throw off his back foot, you can get turnovers off of him. At the same time, if he’s on his A game and the O line is blocking for him, and the receivers are breaking tackles and things like that, he can look like the greatest Peyton Manning. The best ball that he’s ever thrown in his life.\n\n“We’re going to go into this game expecting Peyton Manning to play his A game.”\n\n-rwood@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @ByRyanWood", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/giants/2024/02/10/new-york-giants-super-bowl-david-tyree-eli-manning-plaxico-burress-wide-right/72550761007/", "title": "New York Giants: Ranking their 10 greatest Super Bowl moments", "text": "Those four Vince Lombardi trophies on display in the lobby of the New York Giants' training facility represent the greatest moments the franchise has ever had.\n\nOn the eve of Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs set to play for their own Lombardi, with Patrick Mahomes seeking to deliver a championship repeat and Taylor Swift's trek from Japan to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce, the Giants are another year removed from the Super excellence they believe defines the organization.\n\nCan Brian Daboll and Joe Schoen get Big Blue back in contention for the Big Game? That's the goal, and coming off a 6-11 campaign, with plenty of work to be done, the challenge is certainly a daunting one.\n\nWe all have unforgettable memories from when the Giants finished on top, certain plays that could have gone the other way and reversed the outcome. It's why Super Bowl XXXV against the Ravens is a distant fifth for the Giants in their history.\n\nAsante Samuel's dropped interception in Super Bowl XLII.

Steve Smith, Mr. Reliable\n\nOne of the most impactful plays in Super Bowl history that always gets lost in time.\n\nThe Helmet Catch happened, and video highlights suggest that Plaxico Burress' game-winning touchdown catch came right after. But that might not ever take place if not for Steve Smith's clutch 12-yard grab on a third-and-11 from the New England 25-yard line with 45 seconds left.\n\nSmith was such an indispensable player on that team, and his fifth reception proved to be enormous.\n\nOne play later, Eli Manning hit Burress to seal Super Bowl XLII and the rest is NFL history.\n\n9. Chase-ing down Gronk\n\nChase Blackburn had submitted his paperwork to become a substitute middle school math teacher in his Ohio hometown. Weeks later, called back to the Giants as a starting middle linebacker, Blackburn was chasing down Patriots legend Rob Gronkowski and intercepting Tom Brady in a critical play that swung Super Bowl XLVI in the Giants' favor.\n\n8. By George (Martin): Big Blue decks John Elway\n\nLate in the second quarter of Super Bowl XXI, the Giants trailed the Broncos, 10-7, and Denver was driving to extend its lead. John Elway was sacked on first down and threw an incomplete pass on second down before George Martin chased Denver's Hall of Fame quarterback into the end zone on third-and-12.\n\nMartin decked Elway for a safety, pulling the Giants within 10-9, and Big Blue used that momentum to roll in the second half en route to a 39-20 victory.\n\n7. Jay Alford: A rookie rises up\n\nThe Giants took the lead on Manning-to-Burress late in Super Bowl XLII, but everyone on Big Blue held their breath with time still on the clock. The prospects of seeing Tom Brady with the ball and Randy Moss on the field were enough to cause extreme worry.\n\nBut facing second down at the Patriots' own 25, Brady was obliterated by rookie Jay Alford, who worked his way free on the interior and delivered a sack that all but sealed the triumph.\n\n6. Mark Ingram refuses to go down\n\nThe Giants found themselves down 12-10 at halftime of Super Bowl XXV, but they received the ball first in the second half and set a different tone during a record-setting drive that lasted almost 10 minutes.\n\nFaced with a third-and-13, Jeff Hostetler completed a pass to receiver Mark Ingram, who took over and delivered the highlight of his career. He broke five tackles to get to the sticks for a 14-yard gain.\n\nHad the Bills stopped Ingram, the Giants might have had to kick a field. Instead, the drive continued and Ottis Anderson powered into the end zone five plays later to give the Giants a 17-12 lead.\n\n5. Thou shall not pass (into the end zone)\n\nThis was a series of plays, actually, and the Big Blue Wrecking Crew flexed its muscles.\n\nThe Broncos drove the length of the field and were knocking on the door at the Giants' 1-yard line on the first drive of the second quarter in Super Bowl XXI.\n\nLawrence Taylor decked John Elway behind the line of scrimmage for a loss of 1. Harry Carson stuffed Gerald Willhite for no gain. Carl Banks tackled Sammy Winder for a loss of four. Then the Broncos missed a 23-yard field goal, so even though they still led 10-7, the Giants were the ones that send a message.\n\n4. 'Manning lobs it, Burress alone, touchdown New York'\n\nManning and Burress delivered the iconic answer to Michael Strahan's famous \"17-14\" plea.\n\nManning lofted a 13-yard pass to the far left corner of the end zone for Burress, who cleanly beat New England's Ellis Hobbs by running right past him to catch the game-winning touchdown of Super Bowl XLII.\n\n3. 'Rio is grand - and that throw!\n\nPerhaps the best throw of Manning's career in one of the most pivotal moments. The perfect route run by Mario Manningham with a spectacular catch.\n\nThe Giants don't win Super Bowl XLVI without the play that was confirmed by replay, as Manningham hauled in the 38-yard reception with a toe-tap between defenders on the Patriots' sideline. Five plays later, Ahmad Bradshaw scored the decisive touchdown.\n\n2. Wide Right ... enough said!\n\nScott Norwood lives in Bills' infamy, obviously, but the play itself is one of those still celebrated in Giants' history, and rightfully so. Norwood pushed a 47-yard attempt wide right on the final play of Super Bowl XXV on Jan. 27, 1991, giving the Giants a 20-19 win and their second Lombardi trophy.\n\nImages of elation include Reyna Thompson at the point of the kick, thrusting his arms in the air, and Everson Walls' moment of exultation that was captured on the cover of Sports Illustrated.\n\n1. David (Tyree's helmet) slays Goliath\n\nImagine if Eli Manning threw the ball to right guard Chris Snee, as he later joked he thought about doing.\n\nYet Manning spun away from the grasp of a crowd of Patriots, heaving a throw to the middle of the field where David Tyree was. He was open for a split second before Patriots safety Rodney Harrison came charging, but Tyree was able to pin the ball against his helmet for an incredible 32-yard catch that lives on as one of the most improbable plays in the history of the sport.\n\nFour plays later, Burress and the Giants were celebrating in the end zone.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2024/08/15/nfl-kickoff-rules-returns-preseason/74807289007/", "title": "NFL kickoff rules already throwing teams for a loop", "text": "You ain’t seen nothing yet.\n\nPardon the grammar, but that pretty much sums up the preseason rollout of the NFL’s new “dynamic” kickoff. What happens in August won’t necessarily be in Bachman-Turner Overdrive when September comes around as NFL teams adapt to the most radical kickoff makeover in, like, forever.\n\nTake it from some sharp football minds.\n\n“I think people will feel their way in the preseason for two reasons: You don’t want to show a lot and you don’t know a lot,” Pittsburgh Steelers special teams coach Danny Smith told USA TODAY Sports following a recent training camp practice in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.\n\n“That’s for real. That’s coaches. Players. Officials. Nobody does. It’s new to all of us. I think we’ll all grow together for a few weeks, and then I feel it will take off.”\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nJim Harbaugh, the new Los Angeles Chargers coach, vouched for the preparation headed by his special teams coaches, coordinator Ryan Ficken and Chris Gould, since the team hit the field for OTAs in May. And he, too, proclaims to be uncertain when envisioning strategy for the regular season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sept. 8 at SoFi Stadium.\n\nBigger returners? Precision kickoffs?\n\n“I just don’t know,” Harbaugh told USA TODAY Sports following a camp practice last week in El Segundo, California. “You probably think anything and everything is possible. To say we haven’t decided yet how we’ll do it for the Raiders game would be accurate.”\n\nAs Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay put it, “It just feels weird. I know the intent is right. We’ll try to figure it out.”\n\nOf course, the NFL, drawing on the expertise of many special teams coaches, adopted the new kickoff play (beginning with a one-year trial this season) in an effort to bring the return back into the game – while at the same time aiming to reduce the high-speed collisions that resulted in a disproportionate rate of injuries.\n\nLast season, the league had the lowest rate of returns in its 104-year history with just 21.8% of kickoffs run back. For context, consider that in 2010, before rules were instituted in the name of safety, 80% of kickoffs were returned. And boy did the essential removal of the kick-return leave a glaring mark on the classic, overtime Super Bowl 58 matchup. The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers combined for 13 kickoffs…and all 13 went for touchbacks.\n\nEnter the new rule that the league, hardly short on drama and unpredictability, hopes will provide another layer of intrigue to add to the package.\n\nAnd what a coincidence: The new rule comes in the year that former Chicago Bears star Devin Hester, the best kick-returner in NFL history, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nWhy is the NFL calling it dynamic? Well, that’s wishful thinking (or subliminal messaging) from Roger and Co., though it remains to be seen whether kicking teams will be content with booting the football through the end zone rather than risk giving up long returns.\n\n“However we feel about it, we have to be able to adjust and make sure that we adapt and it can be something that’s an advantage for us,” McVay told reporters following a recent joint practice with the Chargers. “We’ll continue to really put our heads together…I think we also need to probably have some fluidity with it if there are adjustments as we go.”\n\nSure, it’s way early here. Yet if the first week of the preseason was any indication, the NFL’s script has potential to achieve the desired result. Of the 139 kickoffs across the league, 80.6% were returned. That’s a sharp increase from the first preseason week in 2023, when 65.1% of 152 kickoffs were run back, according to NFL data. The average drive start at the 29-yard line during Week 1 of the preseason increased from 23.8 at the same point a year ago.\n\nThe key twists? Unlike the previous kickoff that came alive when the kicker’s foot struck the football, the action doesn’t begin now until the kickoff is touched or hits the turf in the “landing zone,” which extends from the goal line to the receiving team’s 20-yard line. The coverage team sets up at the receiving team’s 40-yard line, while the receiving team aligns nine players from the 30- to 35-yard line, aka the “restraining line.” Any kick that doesn’t reach the landing zone results in the receiving team taking possession at its 40-yard line.\n\nKickoffs that hit the landing zone and then wind up in the end zone can be returned or downed for a touchback that brings the ball to the 20. Kicks to or through the end zone results in a touchback that brings the ball out to the 30.\n\nGot it?\n\n“I’m excited about it,” said Smith, the NFL’s longest-tenured special teams coach. “It’s made me work. It’s revived. This ain’t the same ol' stuff. You’d better study and you’d better coach your players. They’d better know what the hell they’re doing, because it is complex and it’s extensive.”\n\nAnd it will take some getting used to. The best illustration of that came Saturday at Jacksonville, when the Jaguars were awarded a safety after Mecole Hardman – a, well, dynamic kick returner and receiver for the Chiefs who scored the touchdown in overtime that clinched the repeat Super Bowl victory – reached beyond goal line to down the kickoff while his feet were in the end zone. The football bounced from the end zone to the field of play. Under the previous rule, it would have been a touchback.\n\nMore confusion coming?\n\n“I don’t know if it’s going to be much confusion on it,” Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said of the safety during his postgame news conference. “I think it’s a good coaching point for all teams, to really coach our returners in that situation. It’s definitely going to be on the coach’s video that’s going to come out this week. It’s a really good teaching moment for everybody, us included, for our returners. It’s just a great way to learn that rule and learn the game of football.”\n\nIn other words, the coming season will require some special education when it comes to kickoffs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/10/03/nfl-stadium-rankings-footballs-30-venues-from-best-to-worst/75461025007/", "title": "NFL stadium rankings: Football's 30 venues from best to worst", "text": "Among the distinctive visuals provided by every NFL game are the venue-specific ones – stadiums adding their own colors, backdrops and quirks that provide unique layers to football environments that fans have (generally) come to appreciate in person and/or on platforms like EA Sports’ signature “Madden NFL” video game.\n\nThe arrival of Week 5 means the start of this year’s International Series – London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium the host for Sunday morning’s meeting of the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings.

Also scheduled to be featured prominently during the 2028 Summer Olympics, SoFi is unique in its design as there’s a canopy that covers a majority of the stadium, a massive 360-degree double-sided video board hanging from the ceiling, and the YouTube Theater is attached on the outside of the bowl. It's located in the heart of Inglewood and across the street from the iconic Kia Forum (formerly known as the Great Western Forum), so there’s even a nostalgic element as fans drive up.” – Tyler Dragon\n\n5.

I mean, there’s no other NFL stadium that features a hologram of the team’s owner with an AI-generated ability to take questions from fans: 'Meet Jerry Jones – An Interactive Experience.' What a hoot. Personally, I think the best look for this vibrant palace is when the retractable roof is open and the retractable glass doors behind each end zone are opened.\n\n\"No, you can’t miss the TV. Two gigantic video boards suspend 90 feet above the playing field, measuring 160 feet long and 72 feet wide. Not including the side boards, that’s the equivalent of 3,200 52-inch flat-screen TVs. Jones will tell you the idea for the boards was inspired when he attended a Celine Dion concert in Las Vegas and loved the huge video board at the back of the stage. In any event, no worries if you leave your seat. You can get lost and not miss a bit of the action. There are video screens everywhere – at concession lines, on concourses, even in restrooms ... with 3,000 monitors throughout the stadium.\n\n\"Besides the 10 stadium clubs, wine bars and more concessions options than you can shake a stick at, you can be blown away by the art gallery that accents the place. There are more than 38 commissioned pieces of art, including the 'Sky Mirror' outside one of the main entrances. That doesn’t include the hundreds of photos of Cowboys players and key moments from the franchise’s history displayed throughout. Restless? You can also take in the game on one of the two outdoor plazas (with manicured lawns and of course, huge video boards and concessions) adjacent to the stadium. All in all, there’s something for everyone to see – not a bad perk if the game is a dud.” – Jarrett Bell\n\n6. Allegiant Stadium – Las Vegas Raiders\n\n▶ Year opened: 2020\n\n▶ Capacity: 65,000\n\n▶ Surface: Natural Bermuda\n\n▶ Raiders’ record there: 17-17\n\n▶ Super Bowls hosted: 1 (58/LVIII, 2024)\n\n\"Do you have money? Lots of friends? Then Allegiant Stadium would actually be a cool place to watch a game. I think I walked every square inch of the place before last season's Super Bowl. My main takeaway was how much 'club' seating – suites on every level, exclusive lounges – Mark Davis packed into the place. Vegas is the perfect town for that type of strategy, and it all seems like a cool time. The gripe about location is that the better end of The Strip is on the opposite side, far from the stadium. Does it live up to the $1.9 billion price tag? Difficult to say. It clearly was made with designs of hosting concerts and who knows what else. But there are no bad sightlines for football games, and the in-stadium food is top-notch.\" – Chris Bumbaca\n\n7.

The customer-friendly principles that Falcons owner Arthur Blank built into the building represent a huge reason the venue pops. They call it 'fan-first pricing' when it comes to concessions, which means patrons can get a $2 soda (with three free refills) and a $5 beer, contrasting the gouging that exists at so many stadiums. And the food has a 'best of Atlanta' theme, with local vendors serving it without an in-stadium markup.\n\n\"There are wide concourses, including a '100-yard Club' extending the length of the field in the upper deck. Then there’s the vibe, juiced during Falcons games by a DJ situated on a plaza and by 'The Dirty Birds Nest,' a section (134) in the lower deck that is pretty much a party-within-a-game. And hey, the stadium is accessible by the subway system known as MARTA, which has done its part in easing traffic. All in all, the city demolished the Georgia Dome and made a glitzy stadium way better than its predecessor. Now if the Falcons can only field a consistent winner.\" – Jarrett Bell\n\n8.

It’s the noise. Goes perfectly with the 'Sea of Red' visual in the stands. With the crowd noise once measured at a Guinness-record 142.2 decibels, one might find it difficult to think, let alone bark signals to be heard while in the midst of such a rowdy environment. Hand signals. That’s the ticket.\n\n\"Sorry, but despite the huge bucks dropped on the naming rights deal, I’m still challenged to call the home of the Kansas City Chiefs GEHA Field. I mean, it’s been Arrowhead since it opened. In any event, Taylor Swift apparently thinks it’s a cool venue. And no place in the NFL does tailgating like Arrowhead, which can boast the best-smelling parking lot in the league because, in these parts, the rabid fans know a thing or two about how to barbecue.\" – Jarrett Bell\n\n9.

But the atmosphere never fails to deliver, hardcore Saints fans treating every home date as Mardi Gras – decked out appropriately, of course – and typically making this one of the toughest places for visiting teams to play. There’s no avoiding the din of the crowd in the open air press box … until you leave the premises, which isn’t a long walk from the city’s famed French Quarter. Whether a regular-season game in October or the Super Bowl – whether the lights are working or not – cool place to take in a game.\" – Nate Davis\n\n10.

Make sure to visit the Steelers’ Hall of Honor Museum inside the stadium before hopefully taking in a late-season contest against the Ravens with the wind whipping (and blowing field-goal tries off target) and the sod torn up. Of course, gonna be tough to ever top Bane blowing up ‘Gotham City Stadium’ in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ … though props to ex-Pittsburgh receiver Hines Ward for scoring despite the explosives.” – Nate Davis\n\n11.

Are we early to our seats, because Dolphins fans are still tailgating outside? They play tennis and race Formula 1 cars here, too? It may not boast the historic charm some NFL venues offer, but it’s a slice of an eclectic city where sports and entertainment converge. Don’t forget your bathing suit.” – Safid Deen\n\n12.

It can be distracting to players, but the shadows created by the retractable north end-zone window and/or sliding roof can create some wild shadows on the field. The statue of Peyton Manning, adjacency to downtown Indy – and ability to get there via underground walkways that guard against the elements – are nifty bonus accents.\" – Nate Davis\n\nT-13.

The Linc is nothing special in itself – this place is made by the fans. The building might have the highest per capita cussing rate in North America and is always a difficult environment for the visiting team (and fans) – and usually the home team, too. Reach out far enough from the east side of the stadium and you can practically high-five somebody traveling south on Interstate-95. The entire setup in Philly is a transit lover’s dream, with Wells Fargo Arena (home of the 76ers and Flyers) and Citizens Bank Park (home of the Phillies) accessible via SEPTA. It’s a beautiful combination of massive structures all separated by parking lots on the south side of town.\" – Chris Bumbaca\n\nT-13.

The Ravens have revealed a gradual renovation process that began earlier this year. There is a certain steepness to the upper sections that makes it feel as though fans are on top of the field. Those wearing purple and black create an aesthetically pleasing visual – certainly more so than the surrounding area, but if you’re cool with tailgating on train tracks, then go for it.\" – Chris Bumbaca\n\nT-13.

Its sleek silver exterior is striking, and the retractable roof protects those inside from the desert sun. The entire field can be moved in a single tray which rolls outside so the grass can soak in Arizona's sunlight – and also clears the interior for events that don't require the turf.

OK, it took way too long to erect a statue of the legendary Barry Sanders outside of Ford Field – it finally happened last year – but at least it didn’t take as long as it did for the franchise to win another playoff game!\n\n\"The Lions came back to the Motor City in 2002 after their 27-year journey into the wilderness of the Pontiac Silverdome and appreciation for the current venue begins with the real estate axiom: location, location, location. Even if the traffic pattern is rather squeezed, there’s some serious civic pride flowing from the fact that all four of Detroit’s major pro sports teams play at sparkling downtown facilities within walking distance of each other. Thus, there are no shortage of options for stuff to do before and/or after the games given the vast menu of restaurants, bars and casinos in nearby Greektown, along the Woodward corridor or in other parts of downtown. And hey, Ford Field is undoubtedly special to Jerome Bettis, the hometown hero who had his Super Bowl XL farewell at the place.\" – Jarrett Bell\n\n17.

No doubt, it can be a drag to get in and out of the Patriots' home as traffic flows (or not) with essentially one way in and out on U.S. Route 1 through Foxborough, Massachusetts. Still, the place scores major points with its lighthouse – at 22 stories, the tallest in the country – situated on a plaza on the open north end of the stadium. And that’s part of the background for the largest outdoor hi-def video board in the nation, which spans 370-feet wide and 60-feet high. Of course, visiting teams might find the boat horn that blares when the Patriots defense lines up on third down as rather annoying. Then again, that slice of New England charm pales when compared to having jammed communications – which more than one suspicious visiting team has complained about.\n\n\"No, Gillette Stadium isn’t as intimidating as it was when Tom Brady was the host. But it can still serve 'Patriot Weather' as the season gets deeper. The whole setup is so much better than it used to be before Robert Kraft bought the franchise during the 1990s. The facility is adjacent to Patriot Place, a sprawling shopping, dining and entertainment destination – and, in addition to tours that take you to the observation deck at the top of the Lighthouse, the Patriots Hall of Fame (and pro shop) can add some value before you hop back on to the congested highway.\" – Jarrett Bell\n\n20.

It has a Silicon Valley feel with around 9,000 club seats and 174 suites, but there’s not really a bad spot in the place. The stadium is located in Santa Clara, roughly 43 miles from San Francisco – and it's actually more convenient for out-of-state fans to fly into San Jose rather than San Francisco. However a major perk, for all the journalists or those fortunate enough to be inside the press box, is the top-of-the-line catering.\" – Tyler Dragon\n\n21.

But really, with its huge glass panels and eco-friendly upgrades, NRG Stadium has more persona than that – especially when the rodeo is in town. When it opened, it was the first NFL venue with a retractable roof – a fabric piece of work that lets the light shine in and splits at the 50-yard line. Seems right to have such a notable distinction. The Astrodome opened in 1965 as the first domed stadium in the U.S. and still stands nearby as a historical landmark on the grounds of Reliant Park – and quite the reminder of just how far the H-Town stadium game has evolved.\" – Jarrett Bell\n\n22.

That’s basically the model for Soldier Field. The Bears wanted a modern stadium while keeping the history and distinction of the building’s original Neoclassical style. They failed miserably in both aims. By putting a new bowl inside the old façade, the Bears limited their seating capacity and now have the smallest stadium in the league, without the bells and whistles of those built in the last 30 years. The massive glass and aluminum structure atop the stately columns is an architectural abomination. And don’t even start on the grass, which somehow gets patchy and thin the moment it’s put down. The only good thing about Soldier Field is the views from the upper deck – and I’m not referring to what’s happening on the field.\" – Nancy Armour\n\n23.

Of course, in Nashville, the case was closed when it happened for the Tennessee Titans in the 1999 playoffs.\n\n\"What’s not up for debate is how Nissan Stadium (known as Adelphia Coliseum when the 'Miracle' occurred) is a neat complement across the river from downtown, offering close proximity to food and entertainment. Its concept within a park works (there’s even a zip line for the kids), and the parking lots are closer than at most stadiums. On the flip side, Titans fans have grumbled for years about a subpar in-game experience – the complaints including a scoreboard that skimps on updates of out-of-town scores, predictable promotional content and spotty Wi-Fi.

It’s that kind of place. Gritty. Cold. Old. Like the dank cellar of NFL stadiums. When the Bills open a new $1.7 billion-plus home in 2026 in the parking lot of the current stadium, it will be fair to wonder about the culture shock for the rowdies known as the 'Bills Mafia.'\n\n\"Yeah, the Bills play in one of the league's oldest venues, with seatbacks attached to aluminum benches, but 'The Ralph' (as it is affectionately known, paying homage to franchise founder Ralph Wilson) still has a certain charm with atmosphere fueled by the 'Mafia' ... and Lord only knows what type of beverages. I mean, who else breaks tables with body slams as part of a pre-game tailgating tradition? Hey, it is their home, their furniture. I’m guessing that tradition and others will somehow live on at the new Highmark.\n\n\"Then there’s the weather. The Ralph sits on a path known for heavy 'lake effect' snow, and the treacherous wind that can come off Lake Erie without a blizzard – capable of turning a perfect spiral into a curveball – might be more notorious. It’s no wonder that when Buffalo drafted Josh Allen in 2018, a prerequisite was that he possessed a cannon arm – a la Bills legend Jim Kelly. No, the Bills don’t want a dome.

Both coaches would be enshrined, too. The Packers had guile and experience and a field general named Bart Starr. The Cowboys had youth and superior team speed and their “Doomsday Defense.”\n\nYes, it would have been a great game on any day, in any kind of weather.\n\nIt would be played, though, on New Year’s Eve day in Green Bay, in the kind of weather that tested the limits of what a man could endure.\n\nAll things Packers: Latest Green Bay Packers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe official low temperature at Austin Straubel Airport that day was 17 below zero. With Arctic winds whipping out of the northwest, the wind chill dipped to 50 below at Lambeau Field, its turf frozen solid and topped by a layer of ice, so that players slipped and slid and fell on what felt like jagged concrete.\n\nThe game would be decided in the closing seconds, at the conclusion of a drive that bordered on the mystical, with Starr plunging into the end zone to put a symbolic exclamation mark on the Lombardi era.\n\nFifty years ago Sunday, on Dec. 31, 1967, the Packers edged the Cowboys, 21-17, in a game for the ages.\n\nThe Ice Bowl.\n\nIt was and remains the coldest game in NFL history. It is among the most memorable games in league annals because of the wretched conditions, what was at stake and the dramatic way it ended.\n\n“I think it’s the most talked-about game, including Super Bowls, in history,” said Gil Brandt, then the vice president of player personnel for the Cowboys. “The ’58 Giants-Colts (championship) game doesn’t even compare. No comparison.”\n\nFor the Packers, the Ice Bowl was validation of everything they had learned from Lombardi, everything the great coach espoused and represented, a victory as hard-fought and as sweet as any they’d ever known, or ever would know.\n\n“You play for 12 years and somebody says, ‘What’s your biggest moment?’ ” split end Boyd Dowler said. “There’s absolutely no doubt about it. That was it.”\n\nFor the Cowboys, the disappointment of coming so close, of falling short in a game they felt they should have won, still haunts and taunts and stings far worse than the decades-old, still-lingering effects of frostbite.\n\n“I think about it all the time,” said halfback Dan Reeves. “I can still remember every play. People talk about that game more than any other. Unfortunately, they show us losing every year.”\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Ice Bowl, what follows is an oral history of the game, as told by those who played in it and witnessed it.\n\nSETTING THE STAGE\n\nThe Packers had beaten the Cowboys, 34-27, in the 1966 NFL Championship Game at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and went on to win Super Bowl I.\n\nBut Green Bay went 9-4-1 in ’67 and limped into the playoffs on the heels of season-ending losses to the Los Angeles Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers. Hall of Fame running backs Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung were gone. So, too, was the team’s aura of invincibility. This was an aging team that had lost key players to injury.\n\nThe Cowboys finished 9-5 in the regular season and then destroyed the Cleveland Browns, 52-17, in the Eastern Conference final. They were itching for a fight with the Packers.\n\nMilwaukee Sentinel sportswriter Bud Lea: “This was not a very good Packer team. They had lost so many guys because of injuries. (Jim) Grabowski, Elijah Pitts … no Hornung anymore, no Taylor. And they were getting old. They still had Ray Nitschke and Herb Adderley and Willie Davis and Dave Robinson, but they were getting old.”\n\nDowler: “One thing we had in our favor was that was our final championship season, and we’d been there. We’d won four world titles before we hit the field in '67 and we’d won two in a row. Lombardi’s goal forever was to win three in a row. His goal pretty much became our goal.”\n\nReeves: “We had played them the year before in the championship game in Dallas. We had first and goal at the 2 (in the closing seconds) and couldn’t get in the end zone. I really felt they were the best team the year before, but I thought we had an excellent chance to beat them in ’67.”\n\nCowboys defensive end George Andrie: “I was very confident. It was going to be our day, there was no doubt about it in my mind. We knew we were better than they were. I knew we could handle them. We had the speed and the defense and we had the coach and we knew how to defend them. We knew we could shut down their running game and we knew we could get to Bart Starr.”\n\nBrandt: “I thought it was two very, very good football teams. Green Bay had some great players. I think it was more of a veteran team against a young, ascending team. We had Ralph Neely, who went on to become an all-decade tackle. Mel Renfro is in the Hall of Fame. Bob Hayes is in the Hall of Fame. We had some very good players and a very good quarterback in Don (Meredith).”\n\nPackers halfback Donny Anderson: “The Cowboys had a fabulous football team. Vince told us all week they were better than we were. He just did that to motivate us. But they really did have some great players.”\n\nBrandt: “I would be lying if I said I didn’t think we were going to win.”\n\nCALM BEFORE THE STORM\n\nOn Saturday, Dec. 30, both teams worked out in Green Bay, though Lombardi had to be ordered by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to let the Cowboys practice at Lambeau Field. It was a sunny, near-windless day and the temperature was a comfortable 25 degrees.\n\nNo one had an inkling of what was coming.\n\nLea: “The Cowboys stayed in Appleton but they wanted to test the field. Lombardi told them, ‘Nobody touches my field. It’s lined for the game.’ Pete Rozelle was in Oakland for the AFL Championship Game. Jim Kensil was second in charge of the NFL and the Cowboys told him, ‘Get this idiot Lombardi to let us use the field.’ Kensil got a hold of Rozelle and Rozelle called Lombardi and said, ‘Darned right they’re going to use the field. It’s the championship game.’ They pulled back the tarp. I was out there that morning. It was about 21 degrees. No wind. Not bad.”\n\nBrandt: “We worked out on Saturday afternoon and it was about 30 degrees, nice and sunshiny. We went to Oneida Country Club for an NFL function that night and it was still relatively nice. Clear skies, the stars were out.”\n\nPackers fullback Chuck Mercein: “It was almost a balmy day, 30s or high 20s. Sunshiny, no wind that I can remember. We were running around like a bunch of colts in the field. I don’t think I even looked at the weather report for Sunday.”\n\nReeves: “We actually worked up a sweat. It was a nice day, and the forecast for the next day was the same.”\n\n‘A DRASTIC CHANGE’\n\nWeather forecasting was not as accurate in 1967 as it is today, and local meteorologists didn’t foresee Arctic air sweeping down from Canada in the overnight hours.\n\nThe Packers and Cowboys awoke on the morning of Dec. 31 blissfully unaware that the temperature had plunged into the double digits below zero.\n\nLea: “It was a drastic change. I guess it was Meredith who got the wakeup call at the hotel in Appleton, something like, ‘Howdy doody, Packer backers, it’s 7 o’clock in the morning and it’s 16 below.’ He said, ‘Sixteen below what?’ She said, ‘Go outside and you’ll find out.’ He went outside and said it was like getting hit in the head with a two-by-four.”\n\nMercein: “My clock radio went off that morning and I heard, ‘It’s 16 below zero’ and I just couldn’t believe what I heard. I even called the radio station and said, ‘I don’t think I heard that right.’ That was my awakening. I was incredulous.”\n\nPackers linebacker Dave Robinson: “Win or lose, right after the game we were going back home to (New) Jersey. The night before the game I loaded all our belongings in the car. I was so tired I left the car parked outside. The next morning I went to cook breakfast and my wife said, ‘It’s 20 below zero.’ I said, ‘No, it’s not that cold. You mean 20 above zero.’ She said, ‘No, 20 below.’ I went outside and the car wouldn’t start. I called the towing service to get a jump and the guy said, ‘You’re No. 110 on the list.’ I saw a car running next door. There was a young guy in the car. I said, ‘I’m in trouble. Can you take me and my wife to the game?’ He said, ‘I don’t know. I’m visiting my girlfriend.’ I said, ‘I’ll give you two tickets if you take me to the game.’ He went inside and told his girlfriend and she jumped at it. That’s how I got to the game.”\n\nReeves: “I remember it very distinctly. Walt Garrison and I roomed together. We stayed in Appleton, Wisconsin. We always ate our pre-game meal four hours before the game. Walt and I put our coat and tie on and we went outside and we said, ‘Dang, it’s cold out here.’ Being from the south, which both of us were, we thought if it’s 32 degrees, how much colder can it get?”\n\nBrandt: “I went downstairs at the Holiday Inn and I asked the woman at the desk how cold it was and she said the wind chill was 41 degrees (below zero). There were five bus drivers gathered around the fireplace. They were all wearing boots and when I asked about them they said, ‘These aren’t boots. They’re galoshes.’ I asked where they got them and they said, ‘Prange’s, but it’s closed Sundays.’ They said they cost $9 so I said, ‘For $25, would anybody have a size 12 and be interested in renting them for the afternoon?’ One guy said, ‘I got a size 12, and you got the boots.’ So I rented the galoshes.”\n\nAndrie: “We woke up that morning and it was a shock. There’s no doubt about it, our attitude changed somewhat. Most of the guys on our team were from the south. It was a letdown the morning of the game.”\n\nRobinson: “It was 13 below at kickoff, 20 below at halftime and 22 below when the game ended. That’s crazy. We shouldn’t have played. The only one who could have canceled it was the commissioner. Pete Rozelle was in Oakland for the AFL Championship Game. Why the heck would the NFL commissioner say he had to see the AFL game? He was there for one reason and one reason only: he wanted to be in California. He did a lot of things anti-Packer. I don’t think he and Vince got along very well. He made us play the game and it was terrible.”\n\nAN OXYMORON: PRE-GAME WARM-UPS\n\nThe players arrived at Lambeau Field, many of them doubting the game would be played. They were poorly prepared for the brutal elements. Receivers and running backs did not wear gloves back then and cold-weather undergarments made from synthetic fabrics had not been invented.\n\nThe Packers hastily erected crude plywood dugouts, which offered little protection from the biting wind. Butane heaters were fired up on the sidelines and players stuck their feet in them until their rubber cleats melted.\n\nNo matter what they did, there was no escaping the cold.\n\nAlternate referee Jim Tunney: “I’m a California kid. My blood was thin. (The officials) went to Mass at St. Willebrord and then we went down to the Army-Navy store. It was closed because it was New Year’s Eve day but there was a guy inside doing inventory. We banged on the door until he opened it. We bought everything we could to stay warm – mittens and pantyhose and garbage bags. We cut holes in the plastic bags and put them over our heads and taped them around our waists. I wish Mr. Gore had been around to have invented GoreTex.”\n\nReeves: “We went out for the pre-game warm-up and the football felt like a brick. I held for field goals and extra points. Usually, you’d be out there for 20 minutes. We were back inside in six or seven minutes.”\n\nAndrie: “During warm-ups, we had our hands on the ground and they were getting cold. The whole defensive line, we went to the equipment guy and said, ‘We need some gloves.’ Ernie Stautner, our defensive line coach, said, ‘You don’t need to be wearing gloves. We need to show them we’re tougher than they are.’ ”\n\nBrandt: “When we came out to take pre-game warm-up, there wasn’t a person in the stands. It was completely empty. We went back into the locker room and came out 15 minutes before kickoff and there was not an empty seat.”\n\nPackers PR director Chuck Lane: “I was in charge of the press and the problem was the press box wasn’t heated. I asked some of the press crew to go across the street to the Mobil station and had them pick up some antifreeze. We splashed that against the windows, so at least we could see out. Of course, the stuff ran down the windows and onto the tables and made a mess.”\n\nLea: “Every time a guy opened the damned door to the press box, it was like the Arctic Circle blowing in. Honest to God. Our typewriters froze. I moved back to the second row and had coffee there and it froze on the ledge.”\n\nAnderson: “Lee Roy Caffey and Tommy Joe Crutcher, my Texas buddies, we were saying, ‘I wonder if they’re going to play this game?’ We kept thinking Lombardi was going to come out and say, ‘The game’s been canceled.’ (Center) Kenny Bowman and (holder) Bart Starr and (kicker) Don Chandler and Willie Wood, the return man, went outside to practice kickoffs and field goals. They came back in and Willie looked like he was frozen. Bart looked like Santa Claus; his cheeks were as red as could be. We were waiting for Vince to tell us the game was canceled and he came out and said, ‘All right, guys, let’s go get it.’ ”\n\nTHE ELECTRIC BLANKET\n\nDuring the summer preceding the ’67 season, Lombardi spent $80,000 on an underground heating system, a first in the NFL. A grid of electric coils, buried inches below the surface of the Lambeau Field turf, were designed to keep the grass soft and provide a good playing surface in cold weather.\n\nThere was one problem, though. The field was covered overnight with a tarp, which trapped the heat and created condensation. When the tarp was removed before the game, the moist turf immediately started freezing.\n\nMercein: “No one realized when you put a tarp on top of that thing, the heat condenses and goes back into the ground. The ground was very, very moist and soft. As soon as they took the tarp off, it fast-froze. You could almost see it freezing. It was incredible.”\n\nPackers receiver Bob Long: “Lombardi was proud of his electric field. The day before the game, he was telling everybody the field was going to be perfect. They pulled the tarpaulin off and that wind out of the west just froze it like an ice rink.”\n\nLane: “I’d gone out on the field that morning and I was walking around with Bob Schnelker and Ray Wietecha, two of our assistant coaches. The ground appeared to be freezing up. We said, ‘Somebody’s got to go tell the coach.’ They didn’t want to do it so they said, ‘Why don’t you?’ I did an interview with NFL Films a while ago and they said, ‘How’d it go?’ I said, ‘I’d rather have to tell Vince that his wife was cheating on him.’ He loved that electric field. He loved the gadgetry of it. He thought he was ahead of everyone else in the league. And he was. But he was real upset when I told him about the field.”\n\nLea: “Lombardi got mad at Chuck Lane, like he did something to the system. He swore at him: ‘What do you mean? Damnit!’ So Vince goes down to the field and, my God, it’s freezing. He looks over at (Cowboys general manager) Tex Schramm and says, ‘It’s not going to be bad.’ Schramm is shaking his head and saying, ‘This is terrible.’ ”\n\nBATTLING THE ELEMENTS\n\nNothing about the game would be routine.\n\nMetal whistles stuck to officials’ lips, pulled away skin when removed and were ditched in favor of verbal commands. Players slipped and fell in comedic fashion on the icy turf.\n\nThe halftime show, featuring the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse marching band, was canceled because instruments froze and wouldn’t play; 11 members of the band were transported to local hospitals and treated for hypothermia after a pre-game practice.\n\nOne person died in the stands.\n\nTunney: “We used a metal whistle in those days. I think it happened to (referee) Norm (Schachter) and Bill Schleibaum, the line judge. They tried to blow their whistles and the metal stuck to the their lips and pulled the skin right off their lips.”\n\nRobinson: “The officials decided not to use whistles. The ref said, ‘When it’s ready for play we’ll say ready and when the play’s over we’ll say stop.’ In regular games, some guys hit late. In that game, everybody hit late. ‘Didn’t you hear stop?’ ‘No, I’m waiting for the whistle.’ ”\n\nReeves: “Offensively, you had a little bit of an advantage as far as running routes, but it certainly wasn’t conducive to an offensive game. When you think about it, that’s what football ought to be. You play in all kinds of elements.”\n\nTunney: “I was the alternate referee. My job was to keep track of the down and distance. I stood on the Packers’ sideline and whenever there was a break in the action I was over at the bench with my fanny at the heater. Those guys on the field couldn’t really run. They kind of wobbled around.”\n\nLong: “Our defensive backs figured out early in the game that Bob Hayes, the great speedster for the Cowboys, he was so cold that he put his hands in his pants when he wasn’t in the pattern. When he was going to receive a pass, he’d take his hands out of his pants. It was a giveaway. Our defensive backs shut down Bob Hayes that day, and Hayes was a big weapon.”\n\nReeves: “The field was such a factor that it was difficult to get anything done. It was hard to cut if you’re a running back, hard to throw it if you’re the quarterback, hard to fire out of your stance if you’re an offensive lineman.”\n\nRobinson: “The field had a crust on it. When we came out for the third quarter, you had to stomp on it. By the end of the game it was frozen solid. In hindsight what they should have done – because the halftime show was canceled – they should have covered the field with a tarp. That probably would have softened it up some for the second half. With the wind blowing, the elements, it just froze solid.”\n\nReeves: “You can’t explain to people who haven’t been in that kind of weather how cold it was. Seeing those people in the stands … we didn’t have a choice, but what the heck were they doing out there?”\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n» WWII pilot offered plane's-eye view of the Ice Bowl\n\n»The untold story of the Ice Bowl's first touchdown\n\nPACKERS TAKE COMMAND\n\nThe Packers jumped out to a 14-0 lead, with Dowler catching touchdown passes of 8 and 43 yards from Starr in the first and second quarters. Both times, he beat Cowboys safety Mel Renfro on post patterns.\n\nAnderson: “We wouldn’t have been in the game if Boyd hadn’t caught those two touchdowns. He was a quarterback in college and he understood defenses. This story, which very few people know, we were in a tight formation on the weak side on Boyd’s first touchdown. Boyd was in tight and nobody was guarding him. So Bart called an audible and Boyd released from the line of scrimmage. I don’t know if Mel forgot to cover Boyd, but that was the first touchdown.”\n\nDowler: “The second touchdown, we were third down and about a foot. We did play-action pass a lot in that situation. That was also a post pattern from the left side, but I was split; I wasn’t in tight like I was on the first touchdown. The first word in the huddle if it was going to be a pass was ‘fire’ or ‘pass.’ Bart said, ‘Pass 36 left post.’ I left the huddle early and I was messing around with Renfro a little bit. Renfro looked like he was inching up (to the line of scrimmage). I ran at him like I was going to block him. I don’t know what happened to the corner. It was really a breakdown in the defense. When Bart threw the ball, I thought, ‘I better get moving.’ I thought he might have overthrown me but the wind was against us. The ball was perfect.”\n\nPackers center Ken Bowman: “I do remember Boyd telling us he could beat (Renfro) on a post. The thing that Bart did great, when the receivers came back and said, ‘I can beat this guy on a square in or square out,’ he categorized that and put it in the back of his head. When he needed it, he would call the route: ‘All right, you told me you’d get open. Don’t be lying to me now.’ ”\n\nLong: “I saw Boyd practice every day and I’m telling you, I don’t think I ever saw him drop a pass. In my opinion, he was the Randy Moss of the ’60s – 6-foot-5, long stride, great hands. But we hardly ever passed. A typical game for Bart Starr would be 12 for 15, no interceptions and one or two touchdowns. If you caught three passes, that was a lot. Now you see guys catching 10, 12 passes a game and they may have 18 thrown at them. If Boyd played today he’d be in the Hall of Fame.”\n\nDowler: “People have asked me, ‘How do you catch the ball when it’s that cold?’ Well, you put your hands together. When it’s thrown that well, there’s no reason to drop it, whether it’s below zero or 80 degrees.”\n\nBowman: “Boyd Dowler is kind of the forgotten man. He scored 14 points. They want to talk about people on that team that belong in Canton, there’s a guy who belongs in Canton. He was the prototype flanker.”\n\nTWO MISTAKES, AND A NEW GAME\n\nWith help from the Packers, the Cowboys rallied to score 10 points before halftime.\n\nFirst, left defensive end Willie Townes knocked the ball out of Starr’s hands and Andrie picked it up and ran 7 yards for a touchdown. Then the normally sure-handed Wood muffed a punt, Dallas recovered and Danny Villanueva kicked a 21-yard field goal.\n\nSuddenly, the score was 14-10.\n\nAndrie: “On my touchdown, we knew it was a passing down. I didn’t get a real good start off the ball but I recovered. Willie came in from the left and stripped the ball and it bounced right in front of me. I was thinking, ‘Do I fall on it or try to pick it up?’ But it bounced perfectly into my hands and I rumbled into the end zone. I like to say I sprinted, but the writers said I rumbled, whatever that means. It was a big play at the time. Not because I made it. It was a big uplift.”\n\nBowman: “George Andrie from Marquette scooped up that fumble and ran it back into the end zone. I know because I tackled him in the end zone.”\n\nAndrie: “It was Bowman? I always thought it was Jerry Kramer who tackled me.”\n\nRobinson: “Willie Wood had some of the surest hands on the team. He just dropped it. Just one of those things.”\n\nDowler: “We hurt ourselves. We had some things that didn’t go well. We got sacked and fumbled. Our pass protection broke down a little bit. … I’m glad we had 14 points in our pocket when we started screwing up. That would have been a terrible thing to go home with a loss after having a 14-point lead on a day like that.”\n\nA STALEMATE, AND THEN …\n\nThe game devolved into a slippery, sloppy shoving match in the third quarter, with neither team doing much of anything offensively.\n\nThen, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Reeves peeled out to his left and took a pitch from Meredith. The Packers’ defense reacted to run but Reeves suddenly stopped and threw a pass to Lance Rentzel, who had gotten behind Packers’ safety Tom Brown and was wide open.\n\nThe Packers had practiced for the option pass but the Cowboys almost always ran it with the right-handed Reeves running to his right.\n\nThe 50-yard touchdown was the longest play of the game and gave the Cowboys a 17-14 lead.\n\nReeves: “Coach Landry said the Packers wouldn’t expect it going to the left. We had run the running play several times in the game and their defensive back was coming up fast. Don Meredith told me he was going to call the (option). I was just trying to keep my hands warm. I actually came out of the huddle with my hands in my pants. We shifted from the I formation to what we called the green formation and I moved over to left halfback and at the last second I took my hands out of my pants. Gosh, Lance was so wide open. The safety, Tom Brown, was supposed to stay back and when I pulled back to throw he said a cuss word. I thought, ‘Gosh, don’t overthrow it.’ ”\n\nRobinson: “The play they scored on, we practiced for it all week. Phil (Bengtson, the defensive coordinator) assumed that Reeves being right-handed, he always threw it running to his right. The guys on that side of our defense hadn’t seen it. I knew what the play was as soon as they lined up, but they ran it to the other side.”\n\nReeves: “We got the lead and you think, ‘We’ve got this thing won.’ Because the field was so bad.”\n\nAN UNLIKELY HERO\n\nAfter Pitts (Achilles’ tendon) and Grabowski (knee) were injured on consecutive series in a loss to the Baltimore Colts on Nov. 5, the Packers were desperate for help at running back.\n\nLombardi called Milwaukee native Chuck Mercein, a fullback who had been cut by the New York Giants and was about to sign with the Redskins. In fact, he and his wife had packed their car and were headed for Washington the next morning.\n\nMercein idolized Lombardi and jumped at the opportunity to join the defending world champion Packers. And he would play a critical role in the Ice Bowl.\n\nMercein: “I was completely familiar with the Packers. Great organization. Great coach. I was thrilled. (Redskins coach) Otto Graham was a little upset with me for a while. It wasn’t a hard decision. I was honored Coach Lombardi asked me to play. My life changed dramatically and forever. I got to be a part of the legendary third championship in a row and to play for the greatest coach in the history of the game. Just a wonderful experience.”\n\nBrandt: “During the middle of the year, both the Cowboys and Packers lost running backs. We got into a (bidding war) for this young man from Yale. I lost the recruiting battle. Chuck later told me Vince called him personally, but was it really Vince? That’s the oldest trick in the book. I wasn’t smart enough to call him and say, ‘This is Tom Landry.’ I wanted to sign him.”\n\nLea: “Chuck was a Milwaukee kid growing up. He loved Lombardi and, my God, to play for Coach Lombardi? He came right up to Green Bay.”\n\n68 YARDS TO HISTORY\n\nThroughout the third quarter and most of the fourth, the Packers had gone nowhere on offense, generating just three first downs. Starr had been sacked eight times. The field was impossible. Several players had frostbite on fingers and toes.\n\nThe Packers’ dynasty was teetering on the edge of collapse.\n\nWood fielded Villanueva’s final punt at the Packers’ 32-yard line. There were 4 minutes 50 seconds left in the game.\n\nTo a man, the Packers knew this was their last chance.\n\nDowler: “I didn’t think, ‘We haven’t done anything worth a crap.’ That didn’t cross my mind at all. We had a whole team full of winners.”\n\nMercein: “The thing I vividly recall, the offense is running on the field and the punt return team is running off and Ray Nitschke was on the field, screaming at the offense, ‘Don’t let me down! Don’t let me down!’ He was an intimidating figure. He had no teeth, snot was coming out of his nose, there was blood and mud on his uniform.”\n\nRobinson: “When the offense went on the field, some of us were yelling, ‘You guys have to do something.’ Subconsciously, we were thinking the offense isn’t going to get more than 10 yards. We said, ‘Listen, we have got to get ready. If we go back in there we’ve got to get a turnover.’ ”\n\nMercein: “Truthfully, we had enough time left. We got in the huddle and Bart stepped in and said just a few words: ‘OK, this is it. Let’s get it done.’ I looked into the eyes of the guys in the huddle and saw nothing but poise and confidence. There was no fear. We hadn’t done a damned thing in the whole second half, but that’s what we were built for. The last two minutes of a game.”\n\nTHE DRIVE\n\nOn first and 10, Starr faked a double handoff to Mercein and Anderson and then threw a swing pass to Anderson, who gained 6 yards in the right flat. Mercein then ran right for 7 yards and a first down.\n\nStarr hit Dowler over the middle for 13 yards. Dowler suffered a concussion on the play when Cowboys cornerback Cornell Green tackled him and his helmet slammed into the frozen ground.\n\nOn the next play, Mercein missed a chip block on Townes, who tackled Anderson for a 9-yard loss. But then Starr threw consecutive passes to Anderson in the right flat. The first went for 12 yards and the second for 9 and a first down.\n\nThen Starr lobbed a pass to Mercein, who was alone in the left flat. Mercein eluded linebacker Dave Edwards and gained 19 yards before stumbling out of bounds at the Cowboys’ 11.\n\nDowler: “When I got my head banged on the ground, I went out of the game for a few snaps. The play after that, Donny got thrown for a loss because we missed a block. We were second and 19 and we overcame that loss. Bart threw two balls in a row to Donny. If those plays don’t work, we’re dead in the water.”\n\nAnderson: “You couldn’t talk in Bart’s huddles. If you wanted to talk, you had to do it outside the huddle, before the play was called. I was always checking the linebacker and I told Bart, ‘I’m out here and Chuck Howley is not watching me. If you need me, I’m here.’ ”\n\nDowler: “Bart called the right plays at the right time. Yes, you have to execute. But he could have called any number of plays that wouldn’t have worked.”\n\nAnderson: “It was probably a little bit of a miracle that we could do what we did. The conditions were so pitiful. The ground was frozen. People have asked me, ‘How did you run?’ You actually ran flat-footed because you couldn’t dig into the turf. I guess I had a head start on them. I knew where I was trying to go and they didn’t.”\n\nA PERFECT CALL\n\nOn first and 10 from the 11, Starr called “54 give,” a dive to the fullback off left tackle. The Packers called it the “sucker” play.\n\nThere were two keys to making the play work. Left guard Gale Gillingham pulled to his right and had to influence the Cowboys’ great defensive tackle, Bob Lilly, to follow him. And left tackle Bob Skoronski had to keep Andrie from sliding left and covering the hole vacated by Lilly.\n\nIt worked to perfection. Lilly followed Gillingham, Skoronski sealed off Andrie and Mercein burst forward for 8 yards to make it second and 2 at the 3-yard line.\n\nPackers right guard Jerry Kramer: “Bart comes back to the huddle and says, ‘Ski, can you make that block on Andrie?’ Instead of Skoronski saying, ‘Gee, I think I can. I’ll do my best. Let’s try it,’ Ski says, ‘Call it. On two.’ He had to get off the ball and get position on Andrie, or Andrie was going to kill Chuck in the hole.”\n\nAnderson: “Lilly was always quick off the ball and he would follow the (pulling) guard. We called it the sucker play. Gale Gillingham pulled out and Lilly followed him and Chuck went right up the middle behind him.”\n\nLong: “That drive made Chuck’s whole career. He’ll be forever remembered for that drive. He made those great plays.”\n\nMercein: “I realized that was a singular moment in my career. It means more to me because I was able to pay it forward, the faith that Vince Lombardi had in me. There were plenty of other backs he could have picked up. Seldom does it happen where you can repay someone for their faith in you.”\n\nANDERSON’S PHANTOM TOUCHDOWN\n\nOn the next play, Anderson took the handoff and scored. Or, at least he thought he did. Many of the Cowboys later admitted they thought Anderson had gotten in the end zone, too. But the officials ruled Anderson had come up just short and placed the ball a foot from the goal line.\n\nStill, it was good for a first down.\n\nRobinson: “All the guys I talked to from Dallas said Donny definitely scored on the play. You see it on film. Guys throw their hands in the air and grab their helmets. They thought the game was over.”\n\nAnderson: “There wasn’t any doubt in my mind that I scored, because I was halfway across the goal line. But they didn’t give it to us. I remember when I got up the official moved the ball back about 10 inches from the goal line. My waist was across the goal line. I said to myself, ‘How did he determine where I was?’ That’s what Lombardi said in the film (review) on Tuesday: ‘Well, it looked like they took one away from you there, kid.’ I kind of lived with that.”\n\nPLUNGE TO DAYLIGHT\n\nAnderson got the call on first and second downs, but slipped in the backfield and barely made it back to the line of scrimmage each time.\n\nStarr called the Packers’ final timeout with 16 seconds left and trotted to the sideline to confer with Lombardi. He told the coach that if he called a wedge play – a handoff to Mercein – he thought he could keep the ball, shuffle his feet and dive into the end zone behind the blocks of Bowman and Kramer.\n\nLombardi’s response?\n\n“Then run it, and let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nBecause it was third down and Green Bay was out of timeouts, Landry reportedly told his defense to be ready for Starr to throw a pass. If no one was open, he would throw it away and the Packers would attempt to send the game into overtime with a field goal.\n\nLea: “The Packers didn’t even have a quarterback sneak in their playbook. They had never run it. Ever.”\n\nDowler: “Bart didn’t tell us he was going to keep it in the huddle. Now, there are a couple guys who will tell you they knew. It doesn’t matter. Maybe Bart felt he’d get a better action from Mercein by not telling anybody. All I know is it worked.”\n\nMercein: “I was convinced I would be getting the ball. We didn’t have a whole lot of plays for short yardage. We had a couple dives and we had a wedge play. Bart said, ‘Brown 32, wedge right.’ I never heard him say, ‘I’m keeping the ball.’ I had 34 of the 68 yards on that drive. I thought that was going to be the cherry on the cake.”\n\nKramer: “I got up to my position on the line and when I put my left foot down, it was in a little bit of a divot and I kind of wiggled my foot back and forth and it was like a starting block. It was a perfect thing. It gave me tremendous traction. If you watch Ski at left tackle, his feet slip out from under him and he goes flat on the ground. He doesn’t hardly get out of his stance.”\n\nBowman: “We broke the huddle and Jerry was out there trying to dig a trench. I’ve often thought that was a mistake. (The defense) has got the upper hand if they know it’s a pass play or a run. And you don’t try to dig a trench if you’re pass-blocking. I’ve always thought that almost gave it away.”\n\nKramer: “I anticipated (left defensive tackle) Jethro Pugh being high. I watched him on film in short-yardage situations. On every play, Jethro was high. So I believed strongly he was going to be high. You look at Lilly, he’s got his nose about 8 or 9 inches from the dirt and he stays down. Jethro flat came up.”\n\nMercein: “As soon as I saw I wasn’t getting the ball my next worry was, ‘Don’t assist Bart. Don’t push him.’ It was very hard to stop so I just raised my hands in the air to show I didn’t push him because that would have been a penalty. It would have been catastrophic.”\n\nAnderson: “I didn’t even know it was Bart who scored. I was on the weak side. I thought Chuck threw up his hands because he scored. I didn’t find out Bart scored until I got to the sideline.”\n\nBowman: “I talked to Jethro about 20 years ago and I told him, ‘You had 13 years with the Cowboys and it’s a damned shame the only play they’re going to remember you for is the Ice Bowl play.’ I tried to give him some kudos and tell him he was a great player. I told him, ‘The one thing that always bothered me, I couldn’t believe when I came off the ball how high you were.’ I came off the ball and all I saw was ribcage. I’m licking my chops. Jethro said, ‘When you guys called that timeout and Bart went over to the sideline, Tom Landry told us the only thing that made sense was Bart was going to call a quick slant and if it wasn’t there he was going to throw it away and play for overtime.’ I don’t know how truthful that was, but Jethro’s excuse for being high was he was going to pass rush.”\n\nRobinson: “Landry said the only thing Bart Starr can do is run a bootleg or roll out and pass because if they run it and don’t get in, they won’t have time for another play. The Cowboys I talked to said that came from Landry. They were favoring the outside. They weren’t looking for anything up the middle.”\n\nAndrie: “I really thought (Lombardi) was going to kick the field goal and we were going to go into overtime. I’ll say this: Bart Starr took it on his shoulders and he performed.”\n\nDowler: “I talked to a person who played for the Cowboys – I’m not going to say his name – at a function a number of years ago. He said the sneak was not a good call because if Bart wouldn’t have gotten in we wouldn’t have enough time for another play. Well, who knows that? It’s subjective. I told him, ‘I was in the huddle for nine years with Bart and in all those games I don’t think he ever made a bad call. So that’s so much for your opinion.’ ”\n\nLea: “Afterwards, Landry said it was a stupid play because if it didn’t work time would have run out and the Cowboys would have won the game. Landry said, ‘Lombardi’s not a gambler. He took a hell of a gamble and won.’ ”\n\nA CONTROVERSY LINGERS\n\nThough Bowman and Kramer executed a double-team block on Pugh on the winning touchdown, Kramer always has received the bulk of the credit. All these years later, it still rankles Bowman.\n\nBowman: “I came in after the game and basically my toes were all white and frostbit. Domenic Gentile, our trainer, he had me and Nitschke put our feet in ice water. That’s the way they treated it. It took about 45 minutes and by the time I got out of the training room and had my toes all nice and pink again the place had pretty much cleared out. But I heard Jerry got up on the podium and took the bows.”\n\nKramer: “You know, I’ve watched that play 1,000 times and I can’t see Kenny make contact. I got into Jethro and I moved him back. Kenny may have hit his elbow, but I can’t tell. But I know that I got into Jethro’s chest with my head up and my legs moving. Jethro was going to do one thing: he was going to move backwards. If Kenny had gone out and gotten a hot dog, the same thing would have happened. There’s no pride of ownership here. That’s just the way it was.”\n\nBowman: “I remember Lombardi calling Jerry to the podium before I went into the training room. He passed my locker as I’m getting undressed and I told him, ‘Don’t forget to tell them it was a double-team.’ I didn’t think I had to remind him. He said, ‘You’ve got 10 more years to make another block like that. Let an old guy get the glory.’ I guess that’s what he did. He took the credit in his book, ‘Instant Replay.’ Somebody interviewed Jethro and he actually said I got a better block on him than Jerry. I didn’t write a book. Jerry did.”\n\nLong: “I think Kenny, in looking back, should have gotten more credit on his assistance of the block that Jerry Kramer made. Kenny was kind of frustrated at not getting more credit for the block.”\n\n'THE ESSENCE OF LOMBARDI'\n\nThe Packers had won their third consecutive NFL title with a 68-yard drive in the harshest conditions imaginable, after stalling for much of the second half.\n\nIt neatly summed up the Lombardi era. Somehow, the players reached deep within themselves and found the strength and determination to move almost unerringly down the field.\n\nAs they had done so many times under Lombardi, when the Packers needed to make plays, that’s exactly what they did.\n\nLane: “I always contended that was the essence of Lombardi, that he willed victory with his strength of character and all he stood for – precision, hard work, the simplification of roles. The Cowboys were kind of a high-tech team and the Packers were a sledgehammer operation, highly disciplined. It was a reaffirmation of Lombardi’s values and his influence. That final drive was the hallmark of Vince Lombardi.”\n\nLea: “It was the greatest drive I saw in Packer history. And I covered a lot of games. Less than 5 minutes to play, they’re losing 17-14 and they go 68 yards. There were no mistakes, no fumbles, no dropped passes. Nothing. Nobody is ever going to have a drive like that in those conditions.”\n\nDowler: “I don’t know if I had these real big thoughts of, ‘This is why we came here,’ or, ‘We’re going for our third straight championship.’ I didn’t have time to think about that stuff. I thought about doing what I was supposed to do. Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t make mistakes. Do what you’ve been trained to do. In hindsight, you can make it bigger than it was.”\n\nAndrie: “How they did it? Well, you know, that’s a question I guess we’re still living with. They just kept throwing those short passes, making 8 yards, 10 yards. They had big backs. Our speed in that particular situation was nullified and their methodical power was the difference. … The clock wasn’t ticking fast enough.”\n\nDowler: “When it’s crunch time and it’s time to make plays, some teams do and some don’t, some players do and some don’t.”\n\nAnderson: “That drive was what Vince and his players were all about. We never had a thought about losing the game. He had taught us how to be extraordinary when the chips were down.”\n\nKramer: “It’s really an amazing thing, that final drive. We had not had much success before that. Something turned on inside of us and all of a sudden everybody is doing their job and we’re moving down the field. I’ve wondered for years how to define and explain that. I use the analogy of the lady lifting a car off her baby. It’s impossible. It can’t happen. But something happens in her body and her mind. She has to lift that car to save her baby and somehow she does it.”\n\nRobinson: “Some of the Cowboys said they lost because of the field. That is the biggest bunch of bull there is. When the game started the field was muddy. We were winning at halftime, before the field got really bad. We scored 14 points. We dominated. So it wasn’t the field.”\n\nKramer: “I don’t think it was the field. It was their mistakes that made the difference. They were a damned good team but they were an inexperienced team playing an experienced team.\"\n\nDowler: “We were an unusual group of people. A bunch of winners, I know that. I guess you learn how to win, and we did. We learned it pretty quickly and we learned it well. We knew what we were doing and we knew how to do it. And that’s just what we did.”\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nOf the 44 starters for the Packers and Cowboys in the Ice Bowl, only 29 are still living. The average age of the 15 remaining Packers is 78.3; the average age of the 14 surviving Cowboys is 76.5.\n\nTwo players declined to participate in this oral history, saying they had been diagnosed with dementia. A handful of others, including Starr, would not have been able to contribute much, if anything, because of cognitive issues.\n\nAndrie said he was still bothered by the lingering effects of frostbite.\n\n“I am affected when it gets real cold,” he said. “My hands get numb.”\n\nReeves has a scar in his upper lip, the forever reminder of a collision with Packers defensive tackle Ron Kostelnik.\n\n“He busted my facemask,” Reeves said. “I had a tooth knocked through my upper lip. I see that scar every time I shave.”\n\nThe Packers went on to win Super Bowl II. It would take three more years for the Cowboys to get to the Super Bowl and four before they would finally win it.\n\nAs the years have gone by, the Ice Bowl has taken on near-mythic status. The attendance at Lambeau Field was 50,861, but players say they still run into people who claim to have been in the stands that day.\n\nThose who really were there will never forget it.\n\n“Obviously, if we’re still talking about it after 50 years,” Anderson said, “it must have been a pretty good game.”\n\nORIGINAL ACCOUNT: Bud Lea's game story from Jan. 1, 1968 | Box score\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\n\nThe following is the list of people interviewed for the oral history of the Ice Bowl:\n\nDonny Anderson: Packers running back, made several big plays on the winning drive.\n\nGeorge Andrie: Cowboys defensive end, recovered a fumble by Bart Starr and returned it for a touchdown.

Brown tossed his gloves and shirt into the stands. He waved to fans as he jogged through the end zone and into the tunnel.\n\nBeforehand, teammate Mike Evans appeared to try to calm down Brown, who had three catches for 26 yards in the game.\n\nAfter Brown bailed on the Bucs, quarterback Tom Brady helped lead a comeback. Brady connected with Cyril Grayson for a 33-yard touchdown play with 15 seconds left to secure a 27-24 victory.\n\nFAREWELL, ANTONIO BROWN:With explosive exit, ex-Buccaneers WR has finally worn out his welcome in NFL\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nTIMELINE:Antonio Brown's abrupt exit from game just the latest in long line of controversies\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nWhy did Antonio Brown leave Sunday's game?\n\nWhile the reason for Brown's premature exit is not apparent, FOX Sports' Jay Glazer reported that Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians had asked the receiver to go into the game and Brown refused. Arians on Monday denied an NFL Network report that Brown had told the coach he was injured.\n\nWhat is Antonio Brown's status with the Buccaneers?\n\nFollowing Sunday's win over the Jets, Arians said that Brown was off the team.\n\n\"He is no longer a Buc,\" Arians said. \"All right? That’s the end of the story. Let's talk about the guys who went out there and won the game.\"\n\nBrown was appearing in his second game since being suspended Dec. 2 for three games for violating the league’s COVID-19 protocols. The NFL said in a statement then that Brown was one of three \"players (who) misrepresented their vaccination status under the NFL-NFLPA COVID-19 Protocols.\"\n\nWhat did Antonio Brown say after the game?\n\nFollowing the game, Brown tweeted \"Super Gremlin.\" On Instagram, Brown wrote \"Football is what we do, not who we are!\" and then posted a photo of himself in his Buccaneers uniform to Instagram, writing \"Thanks for the opportunity.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, Brown posted a rap song called \"Pit Not The Palace\" on multiple music platforms. A teaser for the song was published Christmas Day on Twitter and Instagram by Brown’s label, CAB Records.\n\nWhat did Tom Brady say about Antonio Brown?\n\nBrady had advocated for Brown in the past, and he asked for compassion in the aftermath of Sunday's incident.\n\n\"That’s obviously a difficult situation. I think we all want him to – I think everybody should find – hopefully do what they can to help him in ways that he really needs it,\" Brady said. \"We all love him and care about him deeply. We want to see him be at his best. Unfortunately it won’t be on our team. We have a lot of friendships that will last … I think everyone should be very compassionate and empathetic toward some very difficult things that are happening.\"\n\nA costly decision for Antonio Brown\n\nBrown was close to adding some performance bonuses to his $3.1 million salary. According to Spotrac, Brown was eight catches, 55 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown away from three separate $333,333 bonuses.\n\nBy walking off the field Sunday, Brown theoretically left behind nearly $1 million in potential bonus money. His 2021 season stat line: 42 receptions for 545 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nWhat is next for Antonio Brown?\n\nWhile his talent is undeniable, Brown has a long history of personal conduct issues and bizarre behavior.\n\nAfter Brown's successful tenure with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Buccaneers were the third team to take a chance on the receiver whose career at one time appeared on a path for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, after expressing a desire to leave the Steelers, the team traded Brown to the Oakland Raiders. Brown never played a down for the Raiders, but his brief tenure with the team was filled with drama. Brown was sidelined during training camp after burning his feet in a cryotherapy session. In the meantime, there was a grievance over which style of helmet Brown was allowed to wear. After unleashing a tirade at general manager Mike Mayock, the Raiders released Brown.\n\nBrown then was quickly signed by the New England Patriots. Brown appeared in one game for the Patriots, who released him a day after Brown allegedly sent threatening text messages to one of two women who accused him of sexual assault.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2020, Brown was charged with felony burglary and battery with two misdemeanors after a moving truck driver claimed he was assaulted by Brown and his trainer. Brown pleaded no contest and did not get jail time.\n\nBrown was suspended July 31, 2020, eight games for violations of the league's personal conduct policy.\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2020, the Buccaneers signed Brown. The receiver was a part of the team that won Super Bowl 55, catching a touchdown pass in the 31-9 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Brown's season was not without incident, however. In November, the NFL opened an investigation after Brown allegedly destroyed a surveillance camera and threw a bike at a security-guard shack inside his gated community in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nIt seems very doubtful that after Sunday's bizarre incident that another team would take a chance on the troubled Brown.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pro/browns/2021/08/12/cleveland-browns-malik-jackson-super-bowl-leadership-2021-nfl-season-myles-garrett-jadeveon-clowney/5524521001/", "title": "Cleveland Browns Malik Jackson Super Bowl leadership 2021 NFL ...", "text": "BEREA — Malik Jackson has yet to play a down for the Browns, but he has already made a difference.\n\nWhen NFL players switch teams, it can take a while for them to establish a commanding presence in a new environment, yet there are also outliers who bring instant leadership to a locker room.\n\nA free-agent acquisition in March, Jackson fits the second category.\n\n“Having him on the team is like having an extra coach,” Andrew Billings, who's projected to start at defensive tackle alongside Jackson, said last week during training camp.\n\nIn June, Jackson spearheaded a defensive line get-together at House of Athlete, a state-of-the-art training facility in Weston, Florida, founded by former NFL wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Jackson, Billings and All-Pro end Myles Garrett were among about seven Browns defensive linemen who worked out for three days under the guidance of Troy Jones, HOA's director of performance science and education.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“Brandon Marshall has a great spot down there at House of Athlete. Working with Troy, it was really an honor. I took the D-line down there during the OTAs and we were able to work with the coach, just get together, have a little fun, do some work,” Jackson told the Beacon Journal last week.\n\n“We were able to have a good time together, laugh together, really speak, get to know each other's voices, just get to understand who each other are, and I thought it was a good experience.”\n\nMyles Garrett looks to take charge, too:Star defensive end thinks his leadership more important than ever: 'We've had the talent' before\n\nJackson, 31, is one of two Browns players who has won what is now in the organization's crosshairs — a Super Bowl. The other is linebacker Malcolm Smith. Coincidentally, they have known each other since their days growing up in the San Fernando Valley. Jackson said Smith was the first person he called when the Browns came into focus as a suitor.\n\nThe appeal of reuniting with another familiar face — defensive coordinator Joe Woods — led Jackson to the Browns. Woods knows Jackson well and wanted him to become an important piece of the puzzle as General Manager Andrew Berry overhauled the defense in the offseason.\n\n“[Woods is] the reason I came,” said Jackson, who joined the Browns by signing a one-year deal worth $4.5 million with incentives.\n\nAs a member of the 2015 Denver Broncos, Jackson recovered a fumble by quarterback Cam Newton in the end zone for his first and only career touchdown in a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. At the time, Woods was the Broncos' defensive backs coach.\n\nJoe Woods not feeling more pressure with influx of talent on defense: 'I've been on the hot seat for 30 years'\n\nThe title run taught Jackson camaraderie among players is “the most important” ingredient to success in the NFL, and it's exactly what he has been striving to build with his new linemates, whether their quality time has been spent at House of Athlete, CrossCountry Mortgage Campus in Berea or elsewhere.\n\n“If I tell you, 'come on, man, get your s--- together,' I'm not coming from a mean place. I'm coming from a place where we've just got to get it. I've seen what your best is, so if we don't have that camaraderie and you're thinking I'm being disrespectful and you're taking it to the streets, that's not what it is,” Jackson said.\n\n“Being able to come together, have a conversation, understand who each other are, how we talk, what happens when we get mad, but still understanding, still letting everybody know, it's still about respect and it's always going to be about respect [is vital].”\n\nAsked Tuesday what Jackson has brought to the Browns, the first word out of coach Kevin Stefanski's mouth was \"leadership.\"\n\nThe Browns hope their revamped defense can establish enough trust and chemistry to hit the ground running in the Sept. 12 regular-season opener against the defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nStefanski said having veterans like Jackson, linebacker Anthony Walker Jr., safety John Johnson III and nickelback Troy Hill among the new faces bodes well for the defense.\n\n\"Guys who aren't afraid to take leadership roles on is important when you're talking about a defense jelling or a team jelling,\" Stefanski said.\n\nCleveland Browns' Malik Jackson donates Juneteenth books to students\n\nJackson's leadership extends beyond football.\n\nHe is committed to donating copies of the Juneteenth-themed children's book “All Different Now: Juneteenth, the First Day of Freedom” written by Angela Johnson and illustrated by E.B. Lewis. Students from George Washington Carver STEM School in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District received books in June. Jackson said he and his camp are working on sending more books to other schools and libraries in the area.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation two months ago to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, where Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger announced all slaves were free.\n\n“We'd like to hopefully [donate books] all around the country, but just want to start in the community that's blessing me,” Jackson said. “It really was on my heart because of what Juneteenth meant to me. A lot of people think that it just became a holiday, but it's been a holiday for decades. It just finally got that significance [of being established as a federal holiday].\n\n\"I wanted to let these kids know the truth about what really happened. The book allows a parent to really dictate the conversation with how much they want to tell depending on how young the kid is.\"\n\nMalik Jackson is feeling good nearly two years removed from foot injury\n\nAlthough the impact Jackson would like to have on the community transcends sports, he knows people are counting on him to deliver on the field, too.\n\n“He's a missile,” linebacker Sione Takitaki said. “You want guys like that up front that disrupt things and get after the quarterback. It starts up front with our defense.”\n\nA Pro Bowl selection with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2017, Jackson suffered a Lisfranc injury as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2019 opener and underwent season-ending foot surgery.\n\nJackson rebounded last year to play 15 of 16 games, with one start, for the Eagles, but he said in March “mental blocks” coming off a major injury interfered with his 2020 season. He logged 48.8% of the snaps and had 28 tackles, 2½ sacks, 13 quarterback hits, two passes defensed and a fumble recovery. He finished 61st among the 125 qualifying defensive tackles ProFootballFocus.com graded.\n\n“I feel good. I'm not thinking about the foot too much anymore. I'm not worried about how it's going to feel or if I do something. So that's taking a lot of worry off my mind,” Jackson said.\n\n“I'm just ready for this season to get started, to really go out here and reach these incentives that the team has blessed me with and really just get these team goals and get as far as we can. We understand what we have and what we can accomplish, but we've just got to get it done. I'm just ready to continue to build myself out here [in camp], but really when that season comes, turn it on and just be exactly who I know I am.”\n\nMalik Jackson isn't as low-key as Myles Garrett, Jadeveon Clowney\n\nJackson said playing on a line with former No. 1 overall draft picks Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney at right and left end “boosts up the expectations” for the entire group. Jackson has been learning their personalities and styles.\n\n“Myles is super quiet. He just gets his work done. Then you turn on the film, and you're like, 'Wow, he's showing up,'” Jackson said. “Clowney, he's really the same. Just quiet. Comes out here, tells all the jokes, really funny guy. But when you turn on the film, there's nothing funny about it.”\n\nBrowns analysis:Jadeveon Clowney vs. Jack Conklin — four games and 2021 training camp have been telling\n\nJackson's demeanor is different. After two-time Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb broke off a long gain to the left in an 11-on-11 period Tuesday, Jackson yelled toward the offense's players and coaches, challenging them to run the ball directly at him.\n\n“I'm talking s---. I'm in your face. I'm letting you know what's up,” he said.\n\nJackson knows firsthand what a dominant pass rush can accomplish. The Broncos had 14 sacks in their three 2015 playoff games, including the Super Bowl. Von Miller had five postseason sacks. DeMarcus Ware had 3½. Jackson's fumble recovery for a TD came off a Miller strip-sack.\n\nThe Browns dream of their defensive front dominating in similar fashion.\n\n“We've just got to go out there and do it,” Jackson said. “That's just staying healthy, knowing our plays, and when we get out there, just play fast and physical. I know with our two ends, they're going to get that done.\n\n“It's just up to me and Andrew [Billings] and everybody else on the inside just to match that intensity and make sure we are where we're supposed to be, so when they make that quarterback step up, we're right there. We'll play hard. We'll play together. We have four dogs on that D-line at all times, and we're just going to go after it and get it.”\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/12"}]}

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/14/pa-grand-jury-report-catholic-clergy-sexual-abuse-names-details-catholic-dioceses/948937002/", "title": "Pa. priest abuse: List of 301 names, with details, from grand jury", "text": "On Aug. 14, Pennsylvania released a statewide grand jury report on what the state attorney general's office called an \"honest and comprehensive accounting of widespread sexual abuse by more than 300 priests.\"\n\nThe report, more than 800 pages long, lists the name of 301 priests and provides details into specific accusations.

The victim reported that he was abused in Bender's bed, where oral and anal sex occured. Bender admitted to abusing the victim. He was sent to psychotherapy but again continued to serve as a priest.\n\nIn 1987, Bender was put on a leave of absence. He was eventually arrested, convicted and sentenced to probation. In 2006, while collecting retirement benefits from the church, Bender was arrested in Long Island, New York, while traveling to meet what he believed was a 14-year-old boy for sex.

Because Royer was under the authority of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia at the time of the sexual abuse, the Diocese referred this victim to Monsignor William Lynn, Vicar for Clergy of the Archdiocese.\n\nThe Diocese of Allentown began paying for counseling then referred the costs to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in June 2003.He was a fatherless, 12 -year -old boy.

Royer would abuse the child behind the airport in Allentown, in his home, and in the rectory.The child told a friend who did not believe him. During one abuse, the friend hid in the closet and watched Royer molest the victim.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville. Upon his release on November 31, 2005,\n\nYarrosh registered with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender. Upon his release from prison, Yarrosh was still a priest. On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

The victim told his father that he ha been in Lawrence's room for a tutoring session. At the end of the session, the talk between Lawrence and the victim turned to sex.

Father John Fischer testified that he walked in on Barletta and a young high school student in private chambers, and that the student was naked from the waist down, trying to pull up his underwear and pants as Barletta watched. Fischer recalled that Monsignor Hastings dismissed the report, and that fellow priests laughed it off.\n\nLater on, Bishop Trautman recorded details of a conversation that he had with Sister Donna Markham about Barletta. Trautman wrote that Barletta abused 5 children. Barletta was confronted with allegations of oral sex, naked messages, digital anal penetration and masturbation against a victim in 1994. When confronted, Barletta admitted his guilt to Trautman. The diocese paid for the victim’s counseling, but once the victim shared the story of abuse with a newspaper, Trautman advised that the victim should seek payment directly from Barletta.\n\nFrom 1975 though 1994 when he was dismissed from Erie Cathedral Prep, Barletta admitted abusing 25 children and young men. After 1994, there are documents that proved Barletta was still allowed to minister in the Diocese of Erie.\n\nDonald C. Bolton\n\n1952 -1954: Mt.

Her abuse began when she was 7 and continued until she was 11. Bolton came to her house to console the family over the death of a grandparent. The victim said held her on his lap and rubbed her back, legs, bottom and rear. Other instances of assault occurred when the victim was in confession, at ski resort and at a cottage in New York. At different times, Bolton fondled her, rubbed his penis against her and put his fingers in her vagina.\n\nIn another file, a mother of five children alleged that Bolton may have sexually assaulted four of them.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney.

He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D.

He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Will gas vehicles be banned?", "text": "WASHINGTON — The House passed a bill Wednesday that would bar the government from banning gas-powered cars for Americans.\n\nIt's unlikely the legislation can muster enough Democratic support to pass in the Senate, let alone get President Joe Biden's signature. But it is the latest development in months of Republican frustration over the Biden administration's policies promoting electric vehicles. They've argued the White House has used federal rulemaking to force Americans to give up their gas-powered cars and buy battery-powered ones.\n\nTheir anger stems from an April proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency that would set the strongest emission standards for new vehicles in the agency's history with the hope of slowing global climate change. As of 2021, transportation made up the greatest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the country.\n\nThe EPA estimates its rules would prompt more than two-thirds of new car sales to be electric by 2032, a rapid increase from their current share of around 8%.\n\n\"There's no hiding. The proposed rule is an electric vehicle mandate,\" said bill sponsor Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., on the House floor Wednesday. \"Not only does this EV mandate display breathtaking government overreach into the auto industry, but it's also unaffordable, unattainable and unrealistic for American consumers.\"\n\nIs the EPA's rule a mandate for Americans?\n\nThe EPA's proposal doesn't specify how automakers should reach the new requirements, which tells them to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions across their fleets or pay penalties for breaking the rules.\n\nBut regulators estimate automakers will use electric vehicles to do so — in part because the industry was already investing heavily in the vehicles beforehand.\n\nEven before EPA's proposal, car companies had invested tens of billions in shifting their production to electric vehicles. General Motors announced in January 2021 that it would no longer sell gas-powered cars by 2035, and other leading automakers similarly promised rapid shifts.\n\nGiven these investments, industry analysts expected a rapid rise from the current paltry EV sales numbers. Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this year that EV sales would make up around 50% of all new car sales by 2030 and 70% by 2035.\n\nStill, car companies have said it will be nearly impossible to shift to EV production so quickly.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group representing most automakers selling cars and trucks in the U.S., has said the proposal is \"neither reasonable nor achievable\" because there is a global shortage of the critical minerals needed to build EVs and because there aren't yet enough chargers to prompt consumers to take a chance on them.\n\nHowever, the Inflation Reduction Act, one of Biden's signature policies, pumped billions of dollars in incentives into manufacturing of low-emission vehicles, which may help car companies come closer to the goal.\n\nWhat does it mean for Americans buying cars?\n\nCar companies are going to continue building gas-powered cars in the years to come, as a majority of consumers remain skeptical of EVs and because bigger SUVs and trucks remain their major source of profits.\n\nGiven all the constraints, experts expect gas cars and trucks to be available until at least 2050, though a handful of states will phase them out as soon as 2035. To date, those states include California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.\n\nOnce purchased new, vehicles stay on the road for 12 years on average. So every new gas-powered car bought today will still be available in the used market for years to come. Plus, the EPA's rules are not yet finalized.\n\nAs car companies invest in them, the number of electric vehicles on the road is likely to increase quickly, even if businesses can't meet the government's required deadlines. That will mean more varied and reliable options for people who do want to drive electric vehicles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/10/supreme-court-tiktok-oral-arguments-live-updates/77543920007/", "title": "TikTok ban before the Supreme Court: Recap", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday over whether TikTok can be banned in the U.S. later this month in a case pitting two major issues − freedom of speech and national security − against each other.\n\nAt the end of two and a half hours of questions, the justices appeared ready to uphold a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell off its U.S. business or face a ban.\n\nSome of the 170 million Americans who use TikTok say the court has never confronted a free speech case that matters to so many people.\n\nThe Biden administration defended the law, saying the wildly popular short-form video app is a grave threat because China can use it to gather data on Americans or manipulate content to shape U.S. opinion.\n\nLawyers for TikTok and for a group of TikTok creators argued Friday the law deprives users of their preferred digital publisher, infringing on the right to free expression. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that as long as TikTok is owned by China-based ByteDance, U.S. national security is at risk.\n\nUnless the high court intervenes, Google, Apple and internet providers won't be allowed to make TikTok available after Jan. 19.\n\nFollow along for live coverage and updates.\n\nGroup led by billionaire Frank McCourt offers to buy TikTok\n\nProject Liberty, an advocacy group led by billionaire Frank McCourt, said Thursday that it had made a bid to ByteDance to purchase TikTok's U.S. assets.\n\nThe group's president, Tomicah Tillemann, said in a statement that the amount of the offer would be kept private \"until ByteDance is in a position to review our proposal.\" But McCourt has previously said he has received verbal commitments totaling up to $20 billion.\n\nMore:BookTok shaped a new generation of readers, authors.

They put us through our paces,\" said Francisco, who served as U.S. solicitor general during Donald Trump's first term. \"But what really came through is that they understand the importance of this case. We're very hopeful of a favorable decision.”\n\nTikTok and a group of TikTok creators want the high court to either overturn the law requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the app's U.S. business, or to postpone the Jan. 19 deadline so the incoming Trump administration can find a compromise that won't force the app to shut down.\n\n−Rebecca Morin\n\nTikTok’s impact on the U.S. economy\n\nLast year, TikTok issued an economic impact report arguing that it contributed $24.2 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and supported 224,000 jobs in 2023.\n\n“TikTok provides an opportunity for (small and midsized businesses) to grow by allowing them to market themselves both organically and/or through investing in paid advertising and creator marketing,” the report reads.\n\nReuters in November reported that TikTok's parent company ByteDance valued itself at about $300 billion, but it’s not clear how much the U.S. portion of TikTok's business is worth on its own.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nWhen did Trump change his mind on TikTok?\n\nAfter pushing for a TikTok ban during his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump has since argued that he can work to save the app.\n\nTrump’s change of heart may have stemmed from the app’s use in connecting him to young voters – his account has 14.8 million followers as of Friday. Those with ties the company may have also influenced Trump’s change of heart, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\nLess than two weeks after reportedly meeting with billionaire Jeff Yass, a major conservative donor with financial ties to ByteDance, in March 2024, Trump told CNBC that there are “a lot of good users, a lot of good” on TikTok. Yass' trading firm, Susquehanna International Group, purchased a large stake in ByteDance in 2012.\n\nIn 2020, Trump wrote that Chinese ownership gave Beijing access to \"Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\"\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat makes TikTok’s algorithm so effective?\n\nTikTok has been able to capture roughly 170 million Americans’ attention thanks to its algorithm-fueled “For You\" page.\n\nA 2020 blog post from TikTok said it focuses on various user interactions to decode users’ interests and tailor the app’s feed. This includes likes, shares, follows, and time spent watching; video information such as hashtags; and device settings like language preferences and location.\n\nThe app’s short video format gives it plenty of data to work with. While one YouTube video could take 10 minutes to watch, a TikTok user could scroll through dozens of videos in that same time frame, offering the app's algorithm plenty of input.\n\n“Every new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content – so the best way to curate your For You feed is to simply use and enjoy the app,” TikTok’s blog post reads.\n\nTikTok will also occasionally show users content outside of their interests, an “important and intentional component” to the app’s recommendations approach, according to the company.\n\nTikTok’s approach has received criticism. One December 2022 report from the watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate accused the app of pushing harmful content promoting eating disorders and self-harm into young users’ feeds.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nMore:Liv Schmidt, the rise of the 'Skinny Influencer' and the danger it poses to youth\n\nArguments conclude in Supreme Court TikTok ban appeal\n\nEach side has made its case to the nine justices and the high court has adjounred. Lawyers for TikTok will speak to reporters at 3 p.m. Eastern at the National Press Club.\n\nAlito questions temporarily blocking the TikTok ban\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked whether the court could temporarily block the law, which is scheduled to ban TikTok on Jan. 19.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the court shouldn’t do that unless TikTok was likely to win based on its First Amendment claim of a right to distribute its content. She said it wasn’t just an executive action, but done in concert with bipartisan majorities in Congress.\n\n“I think this court doesn’t have any basis to enter a temporary injunction unless it thinks petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of the First Amendment claim,” Prelogar said. “To be honest, I think there is no argument to be made that you should find that likely success.”\n\nAlito also asked whether the court could administratively halt the law temporarily. Prelogar said she would defer to the justices about whether they have enough time to decide the case, but that both sides were ready to argue the case Friday.\n\n“I think it is in the interest of Congress’ work and our national security to resolve the case and allow the statute to take effect,” Prelogar said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:What does 2025 hold?

There would still be a violation, she emphasized.\n\n“Whatever the new president does,” Sotomayor said, “doesn’t change that reality for those companies.”\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nMore:Donald Trump was sentenced, but he already has said he will appeal. Here's how that works\n\nKavanaugh: Can Trump choose not to enforce the ban?\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh probed whether President-elect Donald Trump – who opposes a ban – can choose not to enforce it after he takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said presidents, in general, have enforcement discretion.\n\nBut Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app may not feel that’s enough protection from the law’s stiff penalties, Kavanaugh said.\n\nMore:Will TikTok be banned? Billionaire Frank McCourt wants to buy the app. Here's what to know\n\nPrelogar said that’s not necessarily the case.\n\nBut she said Trump might want to review all the national security information that has been gathered since he was last in office before deciding whether to enforce the ban.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nPrelogar: ByteDance information sharing ‘eye-opening’\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the Biden administration discussed potential limits on ByteDance’s data sharing for years before Congress passed the law to ban it, but found no way to create a true firewall between U.S.-based TikTok and its Chinese-controlled parent.\n\n“That didn’t come across enough in the briefs,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\n\nMore:Think TikTok or Temu are safe? Cybersecurity expert says think again, delete them now\n\nPrelogar said there are enormous amounts of data flowing between TikTok and ByteDance to keep the algorithm updated about what are the best videos to promote. Under a confidential security agreement that ByteDance proposed, Prelogar said, a wealth of information about Americans goes back to China.\n\n“It’s eye-opening,” Prelogar said. “It creates this gaping vulnerability in the system because once that data is in China, the PRC (People’s Republic of China) can demand that ByteDance turn that data over and keep that assistance secret.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJustice Department says First Amendment not an issue\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch both pressed the Justice Department’s attorney on why the government’s concern about China’s content manipulation doesn’t make the law “content based” – which would implicate the 1st Amendment.\n\n“It’s kind of hard to avoid the word `content,’” Gorsuch said.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said she’s not disputing that the law is related to content. But the 1st Amendment would only come into play if Congress was trying to discriminate against particular subject matters or viewpoints, she said.\n\n“Here, Congress just wants to cut the PRC out of the equation altogether and all the same speech could continue to happen on the platform,” Prelogar said.\n\nPrelogar also emphasized that the law had broad bipartisan support, which is not always the case.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nRoberts asks if China is fueling American arguments through TikTok\n\nChief Justice John Roberts asked whether the government was saying “ByteDance through TikTok is trying to get Americans to argue with each other?”\n\n“If they do, I’d say they’re winning,” Roberts said to laughter in the court.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said it very well might be true.\n\n“China is a foreign adversary nation that looks for every opportunity it has to weaken the United States and to try to threaten our national security,” Prelogar said. “If it has control over this key communications channel, it’s hard to predict … exactly how it’s going to use that as a tool to harm our interest.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nGovernment says China disclosure not good enough\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch pushed the government on why requiring TikTok to disclose that China could manipulate content wouldn’t adequately address its concerns.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said a “generic, generalized disclosure” wouldn’t reasonably put users on notice about when the manipulation is happening.\n\nDoes that mean the average American won’t be able to figure out that cat videos can be manipulated by China, Gorsuch asked.\n\nPrelogar responded by comparing the situation to a sign in a store telling customers that one of the million items in that store causes cancer.\n\n“That is not going to put you on notice about what product is actually jeopardizing your health,” she said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nAlito asks if TikTok’s ‘magical algorithm’ is like a favorite shirt\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked whether another company could take TikTok’s place if the company went dark, “to take advantage of the very lucrative market.”\n\n“I’m just wondering whether this is like somebody’s attachment to an old article of clothing,” Alito said. “Is there some reason to think only ByteDance has devised this magical algorithm?”\n\nMore:Supreme Court Justice Alito spoke to Trump - says they didn't discuss legal cases\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for TikTok creators, said they have tried to post on other sites and “fallen dramatically short.”\n\n“I think empirically other companies have been trying for a few years to catch up with TikTok and replicate it and have been very unsuccessful,” Fisher said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJustice Department calls TikTok a `grave threat’\n\nLawyers for TikTok and the TikTok creators have completed their arguments. Now it's the Justice Department's turn.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar began her argument by saying TikTok poses a “grave threat” to national security from the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“No one disputes that the PRC seeks to undermine U.S. interest by amassing vast quantities of sensitive data about Americans and by engaging in covert influence operations,” she said.\n\nAcknowledging that millions of Americans enjoy expressing themselves on the platform, Prelogar said the law has a “laser like focus” on that threat by requiring TikTok cut ties with China.\n\n“The First Amendment does not bar Congress from taking that critical and targeted step to protect our nation’s security,” she said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok creators could win case for their content: lawyer\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett asked if there was any way for the TikTok creators to win the case – because of their concerns about having a place to post their content – even if the company were to lose.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for creators, said it’s possible because the core speech on the platform is the millions of videos posted daily. He said the court has recognized that American listeners have a right to receive information from specific places.\n\n“I think it’s possible,” Jeffrey Fisher said to laughter in the courtroom. “I don’t think we should.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nGorsuch raises concern about the government’s use of classified information\n\nIn one of the few concerns justices have expressed so far about the government’s position, Justice Neil Gorsuch said he worries about the Justice Department using classified information to help make their case about a national security threat.\n\nBecause the information is classified, TikTok isn’t able to look at it to counter it.\n\nThat issue came up when the appeals court considered the case. But when siding with the government, that court said they did not rely on the classified information.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nAttorney not sure Trump can extend TikTok deadline after taking office\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch asked if the incoming administration can extend the Jan. 19th deadline once Donald Trump takes office, even if the Supreme Court sides against TikTok.\n\n“Is that possible as you read the law?” Gorsuch asked Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for TikTok content providers.\n\nFisher said he wasn’t sure and said Gorsuch should ask the Justice Department’s attorney, who is up next.\n\nGorsuch said he plans to do that.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nEven if TikTok closes down, it’s keeping user data: lawyer\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether lawmakers could separate provisions of the legislation between security concerns over data collection and forcing TikTok to discuss its algorithm.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for the creators, criticized the law if the goal was to prevent data sharing.\n\nIf the company closes down, “TikTok gets to keep all data,” Fisher said. “It’s a very weird law if you’re just looking at it through a data-security lens. Maybe Congress could do better.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhat would a TikTok ban mean for users?\n\nA TikTok ban wouldn’t mean the app disappears from current users’ phones on Jan. 19.\n\nNew users in the U.S. would likely no longer be able to download TikTok from app stores, and it would become inaccessible through internet browsers. Current users would no longer be able to download software and security updates, and the app could become unusable over time.\n\nBut there may be ways for users to work around the ban. Content creators on the app have spread videos about using a virtual private network, or VPN, as a way to hide their location to access TikTok.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nThomas questions how law hurts TikTok users\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas asked how the law hurt the free speech of TikTok’s users.\n\n“It doesn’t say anything about creators or people who use the site,” Thomas said. “It’s only concerned about the ownership and the concerns that data will be manipulated or there will be other national security problems with someone who is not a citizen of this country.\"\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer representing TikTok creators, said the law regulates their text, images, real time communications and videos. He argued that Congress shouldn’t be able to dictate the ownership of platforms, such as forcing X, formerly known as Twitter, to close if it changed owners\n\n“American creators have the right to work with the publishers of their choice,” Fisher said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:What is Lemon8? Social media app grows in popularity but may be banned with TikTok\n\nListen in: Live Supreme Court arguments on the TikTok ban case\n\nAudio of today’s arguments can be accessed through the Supreme Court’s website.\n\nThe arguments are scheduled for two hours but are expected to go longer.\n\nLive Oral Argument Audio\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok content creators’ lawyer: `Mere ideas do not constitute a national security threat’\n\nThe lawyer representing content creators on TikTok opened his arguments by telling the justices the creators have the right to use the publisher of their choice.\n\nAmericans have long enjoyed the right to work with foreign publishers, Jeffrey Fisher said, calling TikTok the most vibrant speech forum in the U.S.\n\nThe government’s concern that China can covertly manipulate content on that forum is not enough to overcome the 1st Amendment issues, he said.\n\n“Mere ideas do not constitute a national security threat,” Fisher said, and restricting speech because it might sow doubt about U.S. leaders or undermine democracy “are the kinds of things our enemies do.”\n\n“It is not what we do in this country,” he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nKavanaugh: Potential TikTok data sharing ‘huge concern’\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said Congress and the president were concerned China is harvesting information about Americans over time to develop spies and blackmail people years from now.\n\n“Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?” Kavanaugh asked.\n\nNoel Francisco, a Tiktok lawyer, said the platform's data is stored on Oracle servers in Virginia. He said the law should be overturned or at least blocked temporarily because Congress didn’t consider alternatives such as \"massive penalties\" like fining or jailing TikTok workers for data disclosures.\n\n“I’m not disputing the risks,” replied Francisco. “I certainly acknowledge the risk but I think there are lots of reasons why that risk still can’t justify the law.”\n\nKavanaugh said concerns remain.\n\n“That seems like a huge concern for the future of the country,” Kavanaugh said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTikTok on Jan 19: `Essentially the platform shuts down’\n\nAsked by Justice Brett Kavanaugh what will happen on Jan. 19 if the law is not blocked, TikTok’s lawyer said the platform will shut down.\n\n“At least as I understand it, we go dark,” Noel Francisco said. “Essentially the platform shuts down.”\n\nAfter President-elect Trump takes office on Jan. 20, he said, “we might be in a different world.”\n\nTrump has said he thinks he can find another way to address the national security concerns without infringing on 1st Amendment rights.\n\nThat’s why, Francisco said, the Supreme Court should at least put the law on hold to “buy everyone some breathing space.”\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nRoberts asks for a previous decision that would back up TikTok’s argument\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pushed back on TikTok’s argument that the government’s interference with the company’s ownership infringes on the expression of other people.\n\nHe asked TikTok’s lawyer to point to a previous case where regulating a corporate structure has been treated as a violation of the 1st Amendment.\n\nFrancisco said he didn’t have an example at his fingertips. But he said it’s still clear that government telling a company “you have to stop talking unless somebody ese does something” directly affects the company’s speech.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nKagan: Doesn’t the law target a foreign company?\n\nJustice Elana Kagan pushed TikTok on why the main effects of the law are on TikTok, rather than the parent company ByteDance, which is not protected by the 1st Amendment.\n\nTikTok can still go out and find the best available algorithm if it’s divested from ByteDance, she said.\n\nTikTok’s lawyer said the effects on the American company are not incidental. The company won’t be able to operate in 10 days unless it’s sold.\n\nFrancisco also said ByteDance has 1st Amendment rights when it is operating in the United States, as do TikTok and its users.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nJustice Barrett: Congress concerned about China manipulating TikTok content\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett said TikTok’s examples of free speech include the independence to be supportive of China. She said the concern is with covert manipulation of those messages.\n\n“A lot of your examples talk about … the right of an American citizen to repeat what a foreign entity says, or say, ‘I’m hitching my wagon to China. I want to say everything China does,’” Barrett said. “Here the concern is about the covert content manipulation of the algorithm. That is something that ByteDance wants to speak, right?”\n\nNoel Francisco, a TikTok lawyer, said it was ultimately TikTok's choice whether to put content on the platform and he denied that TikTok wants to parrot Chinese propaganda.\n\n“We absolutely resist any kind of content manipulation by China at all,” Francisco said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nDoes China control TikTok? `Somebody has to be right.’\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch said the government and TikTok dispute how much control China has over the company and asked what the record shows.\n\n“Somebody has to be right,” he said.\n\nFrancisco said TikTok can choose not to use ByteDance’s algorithm, though that would be a bad business decision.\n\nBut if TikTok is being pressured by China to do something nefarious, the company can shut down. That underscores why TikTok, an American company, has First Amendment rights, Francisco said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok lawyer says nation’s history of preventing foreign control of media not relevant\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether the justices should consider the long history of the government preventing foreign control of media, one of the considerations cited by an appeals court judge who earlier sided with the government.\n\nFrancisco said that’s not important in this case because previous restrictions were tied to the limited number of broadcasting licenses available. There’s no scarcity on the internet, he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nThomas: What is TikTok’s speech?\n\nThe case turns at least in part on whether TikTok has a First Amendment right to keep operating, so Justice Clarence Thomas asked “exactly what is TikTok’s speech here?”\n\nThomas asked why a restriction on ByteDance, a Chinese company, represents a limit on TikTok.\n\nNoel Francisco, a former solicitor general representing TikTok, said it is the algorithm that decides what is the best mix of content for its users. Losing the ByteDance algorithm thorugh a sale of TikTok, would limit the app's ability to serve its users.\n\n“That’s a direct burden on TikTok’s speech,” Francisco said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nYoung people ponder a post-TikTok world\n\nNora Miller, 20, walked to the Supreme Court with a gaggle of Drake University students before the sun came up this morning for a shot at witnessing history. The case, Miller said, has been a constant topic of conversation among people her age.\n\nBut her classmate, Olivia Swaney, said the prospect of TikTok vanishing on Jan. 19 still doesn’t feel real.\n\n“This will be the first time we really see a whole lot of, like, regulation on social media,” Swaney said. “It feels unreal but real at the same time that we're having a Supreme Court case over an app that we all like to watch cat videos on.”\n\nIf the Court upholds the ban, Miller and Swaney say they’ll likely increase their use of Instagram because the algorithms of the photo app are the most similar. Others, including 21-year-old Eli Benson, say they might take a TikTok ban as a cue to decrease their social media consumption.\n\n“Maybe this is my sign to be done,” Benson said. “I would be ready for a little bit less social media.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump pledges to ‘save TikTok’ after first trying to ban it\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claims he can “save” TikTok and asked the Supreme Court to pause a law that could ban the social media platform in the U.S. − a big change from his first term, when he wanted it shut down.\n\nCongress agreed last year to ban TikTok by Jan. 19 unless it was divested from ByteDance, its China-based parent company, because of national security concerns about the Chinese gathering data on American users.\n\nThat position echoed Trump’s position in 2020, when he signed an executive order as president ordering ByteDance to sell or spin off its U.S. assets within 90 days. The order was challenged in court and never came to fruition.\n\nMore:Trump becomes first ex-president sentenced for criminal conviction: live updates\n\nSince then, Trump has accumulated 14.7 million followers on TikTok and founded his own social media platform, Truth Social. During 2024, he campaigned that he could “save TikTok.”\n\nTrump told the Supreme Court taht voters have given him a mandate to protect their free-speech rights.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nArguments begin in pivotal free speech case\n\nThe lawyer representing TikTok opened his argument by telling the justices that one of American’s most popular speech platforms will shut down in nine days unless they intervene.\n\nBanning TikTok, Noel Franciso said, would violate the free speech rights of the company and its users.\n\nThe law Congress passed is singling the platform out for “uniquely harsh treatment” because of the government’s fear about what might happen in the future.\n\nThere are better ways of addressing that concern, he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nCollege students question national security concerns central to case\n\nMonica Vasquez, 21, huddled with friends and fellow students from a University of California semester program in Washington, D.C., to stay warm as she waited to enter the Supreme Court.\n\nVasquez, a political science student, said she was intrigued by the case’s central questions about whether a ban on the video platform would inhibit the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\n\nLike many people her age, Vasquez said she predominantly gets her news from the social media platform and doesn’t see the national security concerns others have warned about.\n\n“People are like, ‘Oh, but they're stealing our data. I was like, 'Everyone's stealing my data,'” she said. “You're banning a whole app because of the fact that it's not run by America, it's a Chinese company. I think that's kind of insane.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nWill classified information come into play?\n\nNot all the information the government has to persuade the court that TikTok poses a “grave” national security risk can be presented in public. Classified information is also part of the record.\n\nThe appeals court judges who sided with the government said they did not rely on the classified information in upholding the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nLawyers for TikTok told the Supreme Court they shouldn’t even consider the classified materials since they weren’t part of the decision they’re reviewing.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok creators and small business owners fear death of app\n\nCallie Goodwin flew in from South Carolina with her friend and fellow TikTok content creator Sarah Baus to watch the oral arguments on Friday. Goodwin, 30, and Baus, 27, both said they rely on TikTok for their livelihoods.\n\nGoodwin, who owns a small greeting card and personalized gift store called Sparks Of Joy Co, said as much as 98% of her sales come from people who find her business on TikTok. Several months ago, during the height of the holiday gift shopping season, she said she sold over $30,000 worth of products on the app in just nine days.\n\n“If we were to lose TikTok, I really fear for the survival of my business,” Goodwin told USA TODAY while waiting in line Friday morning. She argues that TikTok’s unique algorithm allows small businesses like hers to flourish in a way other platforms, like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, don’t.\n\n“We've got 115,000 followers over on TikTok. We've got, like, less than 3,000 (followers) combined between Instagram and Facebook,” she said. “To have that entire community, that customer base, and that ability to reach our target audience wiped out would be devastating for my business.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nTikTok is a growing source of news for Americans\n\nThe debate over TikTok comes as the platform has grown in popularity as a source of information.\n\nAbout four in ten young adults in the U.S. regularly get news from the app, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nNo social media platform the center has studied has seen faster growth in the share of Americans who regularly turn to it for news.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nCreators want Trump to fulfill promise to 'save TikTok'\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, in a legal filing last month, urged the Supreme Court to pause the impending ban. He said that once he takes office on Jan. 20, he can find a way to address the national security concerns about TikTok without compromising free speech.\n\nIf the court does not do that, Trump could direct his attorney general not to enforce the ban. The problem with that is whether Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app will feel that’s enough protection from the law’s stiff penalties.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nMore:Can Trump save TikTok? The ‘Art of the Deal’ President wants to try\n\nTikTok or nothing, says one creator, snubbing Reels and YouTube\n\nAround 70 people waited outside the Supreme Court on Friday morning in 20 degree weather to hear oral arguments. Almost all were bundled up in with scarfs, hats and hoods over their heads — some wrapped themeselves in blankets and one man wore ski goggles.\n\nAshley Wilson, 30, arrived at the Court last night around 7:30 p.m. to get a spot in line. Aside from two brief bathroom breaks at her apartment in DC's nearby Chinatown, she’s been here for more than 12 hours.\n\nA lawyer by day, Wilson runs a TikTok channel where she streams court cases and discusses criminal law. Amid the Arctic chill, she was live-streaming her experience in line and explaining the contours of the case for followers.\n\nMore:No more 'Facebook jail': What will take the place of Meta's fact-checking system\n\n“I’m honestly going in with an open mind,” she said. “I’m ready to hear evidence, if there is evidence of threats. I'm not sure that we've covered evidence of that so so far about national security concerns, but I'm very open minded to hearing it.”\n\nIf the court upholds the pending TikTok ban, Wilson said she’ll likely find another hobby rather than migrating her content to another platform − like Meta’s Instagram Reels or YouTube.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen will the Supreme Court make a decision on TikTok?\n\nThe court is hearing the case on an extremely expedited basis because of the impending Jan. 19 deadline for TikTok to divest from its parent company, ByteDance.\n\nThe court could decide quickly whether to at least pause the deadline while the justices decide if they will uphold the law.\n\nAlthough that wouldn't be a final decision, it would give a strong indication of which way the court is likely to rule.\n\nWho is arguing before the Supreme Court?\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, is taking on one last big case before the change in administrations.\n\nPrelogar will face off against Noel Francisco, who was President-elect Donald Trump's solicitor general in Trump's first administration and is representing TikTok.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a partner at O’Melveny & Myers who has argued four dozen cases at the court, is representing TikTok creators.\n\nWhat is the legal issue being decided?\n\nThe justices are debating whether requiring the divesture of TikTok from ByteDance infringes on Americans' 1st Amendment rights of free speech.\n\nIf it does, the government has to convince the court that they have a good reason for doing so and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that goal.\n\nHow high a bar this will be for the government to clear depends on how much − if at all − the justices think the law is regulating speech.\n\nHow did the lower court rule?\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously upheld the law.\n\nJudge Douglas Ginsburg wrote that the law was was “carefully crafted” and is part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by China.\n\nTwo of three judges were appointed by Republican presidents −Trump and Ronald Reagan. The third was appointed by a Democrat, Barack Obama.\n\nWhat is the law TikTok is challenging?\n\nCongress last year passed the law being challenged with broad bipartisan support and President Joe Biden signed it into law.\n\nTikTok had proposed ways of addressing the government’s concern without a sale.\n\nBut the Biden administration concluded that some data of U.S. users would still flow to China and ByteDance would still be able to exert control over TikTok’s operations in the U.S. The administration also didn’t trust that ByteDance would comply in good faith and didn’t think the U.S. could adequately monitor compliance.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2025/01/13/tiktok-fate-one-week-ban/77670356007/", "title": "TikTok's fate: What to know as ban looms 1 week away", "text": "The Supreme Court heard arguments for two-and-a-half hours on Friday over whether TikTok can be banned in the United States in less than one week. By the end, the justices appeared ready to allow the U.S. government to force TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell the company or go dark.\n\nLast spring, President Joe Biden signed legislation into law that requires TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the popular social media platform or face a ban on national security grounds.The social media giant wants to delay enforcing the law, scheduled for Jan. 19, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nIf the ban takes effect on Sunday, Apple and Google would no longer be able to offer TikTok for downloads for new users, but existing users could still access the app. The U.S. government and TikTok agree that the app would degrade and eventually become unusable over time because companies would not be able to offer support services.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be sworn into office on Jan. 20 - just one day after the ban could be implemented. In late December, Trump urged the court to put a hold on the Jan. 19 deadline to give his incoming administration \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case.\"\n\nMore:What to know about RedNote, the app that Americans are downloading in case of TikTok ban\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat will the SCOTUS decision determine?\n\nIf SCOTUS upholds the legislation, ByteDance will have until Sunday to divest the U.S. operation of TikTok.\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Justice Samuel Alito asked if the court could temporarily block the law or administratively halt the law temporarily.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing for the Biden administration in defending the law, advised against a temporary block, unless TikTok was likely to win based on its First Amendment claim of a right to distribute its content. As for an administrative halt, Prelogar said she would defer to the justices on whether they have enough time to decide the case.\n\nWhen will SCOTUS make its decision?\n\nSCOTUS could release its decision at any time. The court does not need to release a decision by a specific date.\n\nHow would the TikTok ban affect users?\n\nIf ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Jan. 19, the platform will be banned in the United States. This means that it will become illegal for U.S. internet hosting services and app stores to distribute TikTok.\n\nTikTok users who already have the app downloaded on mobile devices will still have access to it, but they will be unable to update the app, which will likely become unusable over time. The TikTok website will become unavailable through U.S.-based internet hosting services.\n\nWould there be a way to work around the TikTok ban?\n\nHow exactly the ban would be implemented is uncertain, but content creators are using the time ahead of Jan. 19 to educate other users about virtual private networks (VPN), which allow online users to mask their locations. In theory, if a user used a VPN to set their location outside of the U.S., the user could be able to access TikTok.\n\nBut there are a few instances in which VPNs wouldn't work. Dan York, a senior advisor to the Internet Society, said popular VPNs could be blocked, and using an out-of-country location wouldn't work. Additionally, using a VPN could result in slower or unreliable connections, he said.\n\nYork also advised users to do thorough research before using VPNs, as there are malicious companies that may want to take advantage of users looking to use one for the first time.\n\nAre there any interested buyers?\n\nYes. Project Liberty, an organization led by billionaire Frank McCourt, announced last week that it made a formal offer to ByteDance to buy the U.S. assets of TikTok. Project Liberty's President Tomicah Tillemann said in a statement that the organization would not publicly disclose the bid amount.\n\nMcCourt, former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, announced last month that Project Liberty had secured verbal commitments of up to $20 billion for the purchase. \"Shark Tank\" host and investor Kevin O'Leary announced last week that he was joining Project Liberty on the purchase plan.\n\nIf Project Liberty successfully purchased TikTok, it would only be the U.S. assets, which do not include the algorithm, as China finds it to be its intellectual property.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY's Maureen Groppe\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

The 90-minute debate took place in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center and was moderated by \"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange between the two presidential nominees:\n\nDAVID MUIR: Tonight, the high-stakes showdown here in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Their first face-to-face meeting in this presidential election. Their first face-to-face meeting ever.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: A historic race for president upended just weeks ago. President Biden withdrawing after his last debate. Donald Trump is now up against a new opponent.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The candidates separated by the smallest of margins. Essentially tied in the polls nationally. And in the key battlegrounds, including right here in Pennsylvania, all still very much in play. The ABC News Presidential Debate starts right now.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Good evening, I'm David Muir. And thank you for joining us for tonight's ABC News Presidential Debate. We want to welcome viewers watching on ABC and around the world tonight. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump are just moments away from taking the stage in this unprecedented race for president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: And I'm Linsey Davis. Tonight's meeting could be the most consequential event of their campaigns, with Election Day now less than two months away. For Vice President Kamala Harris, this is her first debate since President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21st. Of course, that decision followed his debate against President Donald Trump in June. Since then, this race has taken on an entirely new dynamic.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And that brings us to the rules of tonight's debate: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. No topics or questions have been shared with the campaigns. The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions. And this is the clock. That's what they'll be seeing. Two minutes for rebuttals and one minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Their microphones will only be turned on when it's their turn to speak. No prewritten notes allowed. There is no audience here tonight in this hall at the National Constitution Center. This is an intimate setting for two candidates who have never met.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump won the coin toss. He chose to deliver the final closing statement of the evening. Vice President Harris selected the podium to the right.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's now welcome the candidates to the stage. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Kamala Harris. Let's have a good debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nice to see you. Have fun.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Welcome to you both. It's wonderful to have you. It's an honor to have you both here tonight.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Good evening, we are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.\n\nDAVID MUIR: So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country. Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago? When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually -- my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They've taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has -- which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening. You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get them out. We have to get them out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess. What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people. But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do -- everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it? We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America. What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues. And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say. Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our -- for our country. And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up. The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country. As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer. Vice President Harris has argued it’ll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They aren’t gonna have higher prices what’s gonna have and who’s gonna have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. I charge, I was the only president ever China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn’t like ‘em they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I’ve never seen a worse period of time. People can’t go out and buy cereal bacon or eggs or anything else. These the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they’ve done. They’ve destroyed the economy and all you have to do it look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump tariffs in place so how do you respond?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump’s presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I. and quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America’s work force, so that we don’t end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did let’s talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President XI for what he did during COVID. Look at his tweet. \"Thank you, President XI,\" exclamation point. When we know that XI was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I’ll let you respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy. Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. She's gone to my philosophy. But if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. You mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.\n\nWell, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have and she has destroyed our country with policy that's insane. Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President trump, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe V. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, \"I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn’t trust you on the issue of abortion because you’ve changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe V. Wade into the states.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And through the genius and heart and strength of six supreme court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do. Exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're going to see -- look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the supreme court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam vice president, I want to get your response to President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that’s not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe V. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion -- a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you, Vice President Harris.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter because this issue has now been taken over by the states.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I won't have to because again -- two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 --essentially 50-50 in both senate and the house. She's not going to get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans -- and then her I think probably her boss, if you call him a boss, he spends all his time on the beach, but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the supreme court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about -- this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost. To the millions and millions of people that had to pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying -- it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: But if I could just get a yes or no. Because your running mate J.D. Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D. In all fairness. J.D. -- And I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get -- they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to congress. Wonderful. Let's go to congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe V. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state to get on a plane sitting next to strangers, to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it. And what you are putting her through is unconscionable. And the people of America have not -- the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice president Harris --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, I have to respond. Another lie. It's another lie. I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. The IVF -- I have been a leader. In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. And the other thing, they -- you should ask, will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Come on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you do that? Why don't you ask her that question --\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Why don't you answer the question would you veto –\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Answer the question, would you veto--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month -\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board in this country. Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden administration. This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly. But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported. And that bill would have put 1,500 more border agents on the border to help those folks who are working there right now over time trying to do their job. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country. That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised. And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch. You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your, your desires. And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, on that point I want to get your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would like to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just ask, though, why did you try to kill that bill and successfully so? That would have put thousands of additional agents and officers on the border.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First let me respond as to the rallies. She said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're going to end up in World War 3, just to go into another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lot of towns don't want to talk -- not going to be Aurora or Springfield. A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far -- the reason they go is they like what I say. They want to bring our country back. They want to make America great again. It's a very simple phrase. Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I’ve seen people on television\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just say here this ...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I’m not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll find out\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond to the rest of what you heard.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Talk about extreme. Um, you know, this is I think one of the reasons why in this election I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans who have formally worked with President Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain including the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney. And if you want to really know the inside track on who the former president is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him. His former chief of staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the constitution of the United States. His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former secretary of defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in this election.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, I'll give you a quick minute to respond.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. Thank you. Because when I hear that -- see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them. They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose, whose, were just killed viciously and violently killed and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job I fire them. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. But just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any president, sitting president in history by far.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me continue on immigration. It was what you wanted to talk about earlier. So let's get back to your deportation proposal that the vice president has reacted to as well. President Trump, you called this the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. You say you would use the National Guard. You say if things get out of control you'd have no problem using the U.S. military.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With local police.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You also said you would use local police. How would you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants? I know you believe that number is much higher. Take us through this. What does this look like? Will authorities be going door to door in this country?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. It is much higher because of them. They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country. And this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow -- and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it. Because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country, but Vice President the...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: use me, the FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I'll let you respond, Vice President Harris.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I think this is so rich. Coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement. The former vice president called for defunding, federal law enforcement, 45,000 agents, get this, on the day after he was arraigned on 34 felony counts. So let's talk about what is important in this race. It is important that we move forward, that we turn the page on this same old tired rhetoric. And address the needs of the American people, address what we\n\nneed to do about the housing shortage, which I have a plan for. Address what we must do to support our small businesses. Address bringing down the price of groceries. But frankly, the American people are exhausted with the same old tired playbook.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Every one of those cases was started by them against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I'll win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of them. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country. They weaponized the justice department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis -- to the attorney general of New York and the D.A. In New York. Every one of those cases. And then they say oh, he was -- he's a criminal. They're the ones that made them go after me. By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They said oh, that's the toughest of them all. A complete and total victory. Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. A really quick response here, Vice President Harris, on this notion of weaponization of the justice department.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well let's talk about extreme. And understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the white house again. Understand, this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the constitution of the United States. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Someone who has openly expressed disdain for members of our military. Understand what it would mean if Donald Trump were back in the white house with no guardrails. Because certainly, we know now the court won't stop him. We know J.D. Vance is not going to stop him. It's up to the American people to stop him.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINDSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy. I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy – With the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We have a lot to get to. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't. You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one -- at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil. As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That’s not true. [mouthed, not audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In Minnesota, she went out -- wait a minute. I'm talking now. If you don't mind. Please. Does that sound familiar?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Don’t lie. [lie is audible]\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She went out -- she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get them out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion, so, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are not good things for the environment that she understands.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we have a lot of issues that we have to get to. We're out of time. Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days. I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Mr. President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them. The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office. You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do -- this group of people that have been treated so badly. I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What’s, when are they going to be prosecuted -- when are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world. And crime rates are down all over the world because of it --\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when are those, David, when are those people going to be prosecuted? When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted or in Seattle? They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?\n\nDAVID MUIR: But let me just ask you--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You might ask her that question.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You were the president. You were watching it unfold on television. It's a very simple question as we move forward toward another election. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day? Yes or no.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, you know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there. And on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured. And some died. And understand, the former president has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation. Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the president said, the former president said, \"Stand back and stand by.\" So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy ‘cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this -- and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this. Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let me just follow up here--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have said blood bash, bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse -- all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol. Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing -- and I'll tell you what I would do. And I would be very proud to do it. I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate ‘cause we're wasting a lot of time. Go down to -- because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it. They don't need bills. They have the right to do it. The President of the United States, you'll get him out of bed. You'll wake him up at 4:00 in the afternoon, you'll say come on. Come on down to the office, let's sign a bill. If he ... if he signs a bill that the border is closed, all he has to do is say it to the border patrol, who are phenomenal. If they do that, the border is closed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those people are killing many people, unlike J-6.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We talked immigration here tonight. I do want to focus on this next issue to both of you. Because it really brings us, this into focus. Truth in these times that we're living in. Mr. President, for 3 and a half years after you lost the 2020 election you repeatedly falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide. In the past couple of weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that?\n\nDAVID MUIR: Are you now acknowledging that you lost in 2020?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't acknowledge that at all.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But you did say that.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things. We need walls. We need -- and we have to have it. We have to have borders. And we have to have good elections.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our elections are bad. And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote. They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that's why they're allowing them to come into our country.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm, lost by a whisker, we didn't quite make it, and we should just point out as clarification, and you know this, you and your allies, 60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No judge looked at it.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And said there was no widespread fraud.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They said we didn't have standing. That's the other thing. They said we didn't have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost. If you look at the facts, and I'd love to have you -- you'll do a special on it. I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you -- we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter. Because we have to solve the problem that we have right now. That's old news. And the problem that we have right now is we have a nation in decline and they have put it into decline. We have a nation that is dying, David.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. Vice President Harris, you heard the president there tonight. He said he didn't say that he lost by a whisker. So he still believes he did not lose the election. That was won by President Biden and yourself. But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election just weeks away. He said, \"When I win, those people who cheated,\" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says \"Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.\" One of your campaign's top lawyers responded saying, \"We won't let Donald Trump intimidate us. We won't let him suppress the vote.\" Is that what you believe he's trying to do here?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I'm going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That's deeply troubling. And the American people deserve better.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strong man. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up? He said because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid. And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him. Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said Russia was afraid of him. I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president. But when this weak pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her, she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy. He got 14 million votes and they threw him out of office. And you know what? I'll give you a little secret. He hates her. He can't stand her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: But he had 14 million votes. They threw them out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she's running. I don't understand it but I'm okay with it – because I think we’re going to do pretty well.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, your time is up. We've got a lot more to get to.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and the hostages who are still being held, Americans among them. Vice President Harris, in December you said, \"Israel has a right to defend itself\" but you added, \"It matters how.\" Saying international humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians. You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain. Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when, end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, how would you negotiate with Netanyahu and also Hamas in order to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I were president it would have never started. If I were president Russia would have never, ever -- I know Putin very well. He would have never -- and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years. Have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden -- she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming president.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that. He's trying to again divide and distract from the reality, which is it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known when that he said when Russia went into Ukraine it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong un. And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again because they're so clear, they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace. That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're the ones -- and she's the one that caused it, that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country. Their crime rates are way down. Putin endorsed her last week. Said I hope she wins. And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gets paid a lot of money --\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Thank you. We have a lot of issues to get to.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with much more of this historic ABC News presidential debate from the National Constitution Center right here in Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr. President, it has been the position of the Biden administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly -- people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we're in for 250 billion or more because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with nato. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not going to protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I want to get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your president. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3. And we have a president that we don't even know if he's -- where is our president? We don't even know if he's a president.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And just to clarify here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They threw him out of a campaign like a dog. We don't even know, is he our president? But we have a president...\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President,\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ...that doesn't know he's alive.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Your time is up. Just to clarify the question, do you believe it's in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war? Yes or no?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. All right. Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to take this to Vice President Harris. I want to get your thoughts on support for Ukraine in this moment. But also as commander in chief if elected how would you deal with Vladimir Putin and would it be any different from what we're seeing from President Biden?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris Thank you. We heard from both of you on Ukraine tonight. Afghanistan came up in the last hour -- I wanted her to respond to something you said earlier.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have to respond.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Please I'll give you a minute here.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Putin would be sitting in Moscow and he wouldn't have lost 300,000 men and women. But he would have been sitting in Moscow\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: (inaudible)\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons. They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that. Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President...\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's the kind of talent we have with her. She's worse than Biden. In my opinion, I think he's the worst president in the history of our country. She goes down as the worst vice president in the history of our country. But let me tell you something. She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate. As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. You did bring up something, you said she went to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. Vice President Harris, have you ever met Vladimir Putin, can you clarify tonight?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We've talked about Ukraine and Vladimir Putin. I do want to talk about Afghanistan. It came up in the first hour of this debate.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: David, one thing.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on to Afghanistan.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen -- he's the head of NATO. He said I've never seen -- for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not going to protect you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump--\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise we would've never gotten it. He said it was one of the most incredible jobs that he's ever seen done.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Thank you. I want to turn to Afghanistan. We witnessed a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I do want to ask the vice president, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century. But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was president negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his national security adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And get this -- no, get this. And the president at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David. A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former president as president invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be commander in chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was -- we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left -- we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it. The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it. The agreement was, was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.\n\nDAVID MUIR: I want to move on.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And these people did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine. Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.\n\nDAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. I want to move on now to race and politics in this country. Mr. President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, \"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't. And I don't care. I don't care what she is. I don't care. You make a big deal out of something. I couldn't care less. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.\n\nDAVID MUIR: But those were your words. So, I'm asking --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. All I can say is I read where she was not Black, that she put out. And, I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. And that's okay. Either one was okay with me. That's up to her. That's up to her.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think it's – I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me \"Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?\" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, this is now your third time --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country. And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted -- they said, they pled guilty. And I said, \"Well if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty -- then they pled we're not guilty.\" But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm going to build it again. It's going to be bigger, better, and stronger. But they're destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies -- every single policy -- and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad – and she can't get away with that.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you, your time is up. Linsey ..\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I want to respond to that, though. I want to just respond briefly. Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people. I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And let's compare the plans. I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work. I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development. I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream by offering a ... help with down payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. That's the kind of conversation I believe, David, that people really want tonight as opposed to a conversation that is constantly about belittling and name-calling. Let's turn the page and move forward.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you. Let's turn to policy – let's turn to policy\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump we have to move on. President Trump.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let's turn to policy, please.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, we do have to move on to other issues.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. That's what her plan is until just recently.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: The former president has said something twice and I need to respond too. I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I'm sorry, we're going to move on, Vice President Harris. This is now your third time running for president. you have long vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. You have failed to accomplish that. You now say you're going to keep Obamacare. Quote, unless we can do something much better. Last month you said, quote, we're working on it. So tonight, nine years after you first started running, do you have a plan and can you tell us what it is?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today. And what I said, that if we come up with something, we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this. I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they would have done that, we would have had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was president, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided -- and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people -- I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of them. But let me just explain. I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be or let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing. But it's still never going to be great. And it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then I'd run it as good as it can be run.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have concepts of a plan. I'm not president right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we have to do that. And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, in 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private insurance and create a government-run health care system. Two years later you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. What is your plan today?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president private health care options. But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act. But I, I'll get to that, linsey. I just need to respond to a previous point that the former president has made. I've made very clear my position on fracking. And then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand. When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 60 times. I was a senator at the time. When, I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being – uh, you don't like him, you said at the time because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night. Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And thankfully, as I've been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you the American people. Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate dr, drug prices. He never did. We did. And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I've been vice president we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am president we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it, (in audible) in terms of where Donald Trump stands on that.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to move to an issue that's important --\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She made a mistake. Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for ten years. But it wasn't only him. It was, All of the Democrats that kept it going. And you know what? We could do much better than Obamacare. Much less money. But she won't improve private insurance for people. Private, medical insurance. That's another thing she doesn't want\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they want to have private. She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you. We have another issue that we'd like to get to that's important for a number of Americans, in particular younger voters, and that's climate change. President Trump, with regard to the environment, you say that we have to have clean air and clean water. Vice President Harris, you call climate change an existential threat. The question to you both tonight is what would you do to fight climate change? And Vice President Harris, we'll start with you. One minute for you each.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, the former president had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue. And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles. It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like what happened under Donald Trump.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going -- they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico. In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people. What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place. What they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they refuse -- you know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China? Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get -- why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars? This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, thank you.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.\n\nDAVID MUIR: We'll be right back with closing statements from both of our candidates. A historic night, this ABC News Presidential Debate from Philadelphia. Back in a moment.\n\nDAVID MUIR: The time has come for closing statements. And Vice President Harris, we begin with you.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past. And an attempt to take us backward. But we're not going back. And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us and we can chart a new way forward. And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world. I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an attorney general. A United States senator. And now vice president. I've only had one client. The people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you the American people.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump?\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So, she just started by saying she's going to do this, she's going to do that, she's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for 3 1/2 years. They've had 3 1/2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1/2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful white house, go to the capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do. But you haven't done it. And you won't do it. Because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in. You believe in things like we're not going to frack. We're not going to take fossil fuel. We're not going to do, things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not. Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We're not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. But I just ask one simple question. Why didn't she do it? We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline. We're being laughed at all over the world. All over the world, they laugh, I know the leaders very well. They're coming to see me. They call me. We're laughed at all over the world. They don't understand what happened to us as a nation. We're not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We're going to end up in a third World War. And it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. What these people have done to our country, and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country, many of them are criminals, and they're destroying our country. The worst president, the worst vice president in the history of our country.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump thank you. And that is our ABC News presidential debate from here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center. I'm Linsey Davis.\n\nDAVID MUIR: And I'm David Muir. Thank you for watching here in the U.S. And all over the world. And from all of us here at ABC News, good night.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/27/jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-backlash/74541493007/", "title": "JD Vance faces criticism over 'childless cat ladies' comment", "text": "Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance sparked controversy this week when a 2021 interview resurfaced in which he labeled women without biological children, including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America.\n\nIn the interview with Tucker Carlson on FOX News, the Ohio senator said that the government was being run by people \"miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nHarris doesn’t have any biological children, but she is a stepmother to her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff's two children, who fondly call her \"Momala.\"\n\nThe comments could haunt Vance, particularly in the 2024 presidential contest, which for many is not only a referendum on abortion access, but women's rights and freedoms to choose what happens to their bodies. In separate interviews also from 2021, Vance said that people who choose not to have children should have less political power and should face a higher tax rate.\n\nDemocrats feel the wind at their back after winning consecutive ballot initiatives upholding abortion access in reliably Republican strongholds like Kansas, Kentucky, and Ohio as well as a swing state like Michigan, but Vance’s assertion that childless Americans are a problem speaks to a growing chasm between the two parties that dives into sexual values, gender roles and personal life choices that make up American families.\n\nConservative activists, athletes and lawmakers, pushing back on what they say is an overreaching liberal social agenda, don’t necessarily disagree with the Ohio Republican, and have trumpeted a need to openly discuss why traditional views are still necessary even if they wince at the acerbic presentation.\n\nDemocrats, including a flood of women and men speaking out online, see it as another attack on their freedom to make decisions about their bodies and that elected officials should be looking at ways to lift all Americans.\n\n\"It feeds the narrative of division to try to pick and choose amongst which families are preferred,\" said Jocelyn Frye, President of the National Partnership for Women & Families Action Fund.\n\n\"Particularly, when you're the leader of all the people, you've got to be able to recognize the differences that all of those families face and be willing to think through how do we make sure that regardless of the type of family you have that you can still live a healthy life, and an economically stable life where you and your family can be successful and thrive.\"\n\nVance sought to dispel the controversy Friday, telling media personality Megyn Kelly: \"Obviously it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats. ... People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance … and the substance of what I said, Megyn — I’m sorry, it is true.\"\n\nIn an election already framed by the loss of reproductive rights for millions of American women in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision that ended Roe v. Wade, Vance’s comments may be an ill-timed reminder for Republicans and a good one for Harris’ allies of what’s at stake this year.\n\nA Gallup survey released in June found a record share of voters, 32%, say they would only support a candidate who shares their views on abortion. Of those 23% identify as supporting a woman’s right to have an abortion versus 8% who identify with the antiabortion position.\n\nJennifer Aniston, Meghan McCain and others denounce Vance\n\nThe comments by former President Donald Trump's running mate triggered outrage across the country.\n\nCelebrities like Jennifer Aniston, who traditionally stays out of politics but has been open about her fertility struggles, said on Instagram she couldn't believe the remarks were coming from a potential vice president.\n\n\"All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nActress Whoopi Goldberg said on The View: \"How dare you. And women, you heard how he thinks of you. This is not good for you, JD.\"\n\nPolitical commentator Meghan McCain, daughter of former Arizona Sen. John McCain, said the 39-year-old father of three, “caused real pain” and is is “activating women across all sides” including Trump supporters.\n\nHarris, who has two step-children, did not personally respond to the remarks, but her children and Emhoff's ex-wife have.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Kerstin Emhoff, Ella and Cole Emhoff's mother and ex-wife to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, said that, “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”\n\nMore:Kamala Harris's stepdaughter knocks JD Vance over 'childless cat ladies' remarks\n\nProfessor Nadia Brown, chair of the Women's and Gender Studies Program at Georgetown University, said Vance’s comment was meant to play into the “cat ladies stereotype” of being someone who is unlovable, who uses their maternal instinct for animals or non-human beings.\n\nHe's saying “if women cannot find love or fulfillment in romantic ways and their children, then somehow they are deserving [of] ridicule,” Brown said.\n\nThe comment seeks to tie women back to the home or to their private life as opposed to thinking about women finding fulfillment and love in their careers or with their animals, Brown said.\n\nVance is absolutely terrified of the power of American women, said Mini Timmaraju, CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All.\n\n“It’s that simple. He can see as clearly as the rest of us that voters are turned off by the GOP’s extremist agenda,” she said. “He’s spewing whatever kind of nonsense he can think of to discredit the undeniable political power of the 8 in 10 Americans who support the legal right to abortion.”\n\nSocial media quickly filled with photos of women with their pets, alongside snarky memes and many embraced it as a badge of honor. Democratic groups have arranged an organizing call titled \"cats and dog ladies unite\" for Tuesday evening. Shirts proclaiming the wearer is a \"miserable childless cat lady\" and \"childless cat lady for Kamala\" are for sale on Etsy. Childless dog and cat dad's are also jumping on board.\n\nDelia Cintron, 70, a retired manager at Estee Lauder, said she has been \"fuming mad at this absolutely backward individual\" ever since she heard Vance's comments.\n\nCintron said she chose not to have children of her own free will.\n\n\"It's absolutely sad. We are a country that moves forward, that comes to a higher level of consciousness and thinking and education. We lead the world,\" she said. \"I think that the choice is very clear. Women have to be in the room where decisions are made, where they lead, where this patriarchal society nonsense that want to keep women down and as functionaries to have children does not become a reality.\"\n\nMore:Vance's 'childless cat ladies' comment sparks uproar from Swift fans: 'Armageddon is coming'\n\n“It’s no surprise that JD Vance is appalled by 'childless cat ladies'. His plan is to keep women barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen with no human rights,\" said Carol Evans, 71, of West Asheville, N.C., a retired CEO of a nonprofit focused on cancer care for women. \"I see JD Vance’s “Childless cat ladies” comment as just one more effort to deny women their human rights.”\n\nMary Refling, 70, a retired college professor from New York who never had children of her own, said her first thought when she heard J.D. Vance’s “ridiculous” comments was that she was going to have fun with it.\n\n“I immediately started posting memes on Facebook, and I posted pictures of me with my cats with a snarky look on my face,” she said.\n\nA lot of her friends who don’t have children do love cats and dogs, she said.\n\n“The idea that because we are childless, we're miserable is a completely twisted way of looking at the modern structure of the family,” she said.\n\nFor Refling, who is married and has two stepchildren, it was a conscious decision to not have children because of the demands of an academic career. With her step-children, she had help from her husband’s ex-wife, she said.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is talking about looking to the future and not looking backwards,” she said.\n\nHarris finds her voice on women's issues\n\nThe vice president, who is the first woman to hold the seat, has arguably found her best political footing on the issue of abortion, regularly warning voters that they shouldn’t trust Trump’s promise not to pursue a federal abortion ban.\n\nEarlier in the year, Harris broke a political barrier by touring a Minnesota-based Planned Parenthood clinic, the first for a president or vice president. There she spoke in blunt terms about women’s reproductive health care needs. She's held over 100 events related to abortion access after Roe v. Wade in the year since it was struck down.\n\nHarris speaks about sex and access to reproductive health care as \"freedom\" and \"uses this language of liberty and government interference\" in a way that makes her a particularly poignant speaker on the topic, said Susan Liebell, a political science professor at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia.\n\n\"Not only does Harris hit hard on unbridled government power violating bodily freedom, she reframes abortion as routine health care that 1 out of 4 American women will access in their lifetimes,\" Liebell said.\n\nSome women were quick to step to Harris' defense after the Vance remarks.\n\n\"First of all, she has kids. She's in a family, they're blended family. I think it's really just not appropriate and insulting to many different types of families in our nation to define the concept of family so narrowly. I think that's just unfair and doesn't really merit a response in any meaningful way,\" Frye told USA TODAY.\n\nFrye noted that male candidates' worth is not dependent on their number of dependents.\n\n\"Truthfully, there's baked into those sorts of narratives, a lot of gender bias. People don't have a concern about single men. It's really women, just trying to diminish the accomplishments and perspective that they bring,\" she said.\n\nConservativesagree with Vance’s point, but not his rhetoric\n\nVance’s remarks have offended many women, but it sparked a debate on the political right with roughly 100 days until the fall election.\n\nFormer Senate candidate Blake Masters, of Arizona, who Vance has endorsed for Congress, said elected leaders, “should have children” to make better decisions for future generations.\n\n“Skin in the game matters,” Masters said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nVance's female relatives and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene,R-Ga., have rushed to publicly defend him, too. Far right commentator Alex Jones posted on Truth Social that Vance \"makes an important point about the misery of leftist cat ladies.\"\n\nSocial conservatives have long upheld the traditional family as an American foundation, and that having children is a glue for the country’s social cohesion.\n\nVance’s remarks reveal a cavernous debate on the political right where many argue he is correct on the substance, but that his style is wrong-headed. Jokes about childless cat women have long been common in some conservative circles.\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, said in an interview she wasn’t offended by Vance, and urged Republicans to engage the debate more in a way that appeals to rank-and-file conservative women.\n\n“As women we're sold this lie that we have to have this uninterrupted career in order to build our resume, and that any interruption to that kind of career track is going to be harmful,” she said.\n\nHawkins said she knows countless professional GOP women who live in the Washington, D.C. area who leave their careers to return home.\n\n“It was because, ‘I can't find my husband here. There are no men,’” she said.\n\n“This is a real conversation that plays out on social media, in coffee shops and with your female friends who are looking for a spouse.”\n\nOther conservative thinkers warn against browbeating women when it comes to the debate around a rising tide of unmarried, childless voters. They contend there is an argument to be made about its negatives impact on America's society without personal vitriol.\n\n“I would agree with the substance of Sen. Vance's concerns,” Andrew T. Walker, a professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told USA TODAY.\n\n“But there's legitimate conversation to be had about the way that it was expressed, which was probably a little bit irreverent, acerbic and perhaps condescending to a constituency that obviously they're going to need in order to build a coalition to win.”\n\nIn 2020, for instance, exit polls found 63% of unmarried women and 55% of childless women voted for Biden over Trump. That is worrisome to Republicans given the trends over the past few decades as more Americans remain single and without kids.\n\n“This is tied to what we think is at the absolute bedrock foundation of a stable social order,” Walker said.\n\n“My challenge to conservatives would be not to appear hectoring or condemning, but show why children are intrinsically worthwhile, and that's not just a child issue that's a marriage issue.”\n\nStudy: More Americans are avoiding parenthood\n\nA new study released Thursday amid the fiery online debate underscores how Vance may have stepped into a larger hornet’s nest politically with voters.\n\nThe Pew Research Center finds 47% of U.S. adults under age 50 without children say they're unlikely to ever have them. That is up 10 percentage points compared to when the center asked the same question in 2018.\n\nRespondents gave various reasons for declining being a parent, such as focusing on different things in life (44%); the state of the world (38%); can't afford them (36%); and infertility (13%).\n\nBut the largest reason was 57% of Americans age 18-49 who said, “they just don’t want” children.\n\nYounger women were more likely to say such, the Pew study found, with 64% saying they don’t want children versus 50% of younger men who said the same.\n\nSome Harris supporters have explicitly highlighted how they identify with vice president as a professional woman who was single until age 49.\n\nWalker said social conservatives shouldn’t shrink from the family debate and calling for certain policy reforms, such as making childbirth free or further incentivizing marriage through the tax code.\n\nBut they should avoid demonizing a person or their life choices, he said.\n\n“We really as conservatives are needing to flip the moral imagination to understand that yes, children are costly, yes, they impede upon your time,” Walker said.\n\n\"But as a parent of three daughters myself, there are immaterial values to having a child that money and time can't measure for.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/17/takeaways-from-jd-vances-campaign-stop-in-eau-claire/75212263007/", "title": "Takeaways from JD Vance's campaign stop in Eau Claire", "text": "In a region of Wisconsin both campaigns are targeting, vice presidential hopeful JD Vance criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' track record on immigration, defended his claims that cats and dogs were being consumed in Ohio and blamed Democrats for the most recent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nVance on Tuesday made his second trip to Eau Claire and his fifth to Wisconsin. Western Wisconsin has been a frequent stop for the campaigns. Trump conducted a town hall meeting in La Crosse on Aug. 29. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, rallied in Eau Claire on Aug. 7, the same day as Vance's first visit. Walz made a campaign stop in Superior last week. Harris is scheduled to be in Madison on Friday.\n\nHere's what you should know about Vance's latest visit to Wisconsin.\n\nVance blames the media on Springfield, Ohio, pet-eating comments\n\nWhen asked about whether he should have fact-checked the claim that migrants were eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, Vance said that it was the responsibility of the media to report on the real problems.\n\nSome 15,000 Haitian migrants have settled in Springfield in recent years, straining services in a community of about 60,000 residents while also spurring economic and industrial progress.\n\n\"I've got residents of Springfield who are coming to me with a dozen different problems. They've been talking about it for months, or in some cases, years,\" he said. \"The American media totally ignored it until they showed up to fact-check what some people were saying about pets.\"\n\nBut he refused to acknowledge whether the claim was correct or incorrect, even though several Springfield agencies have said they have not received reports of immigrants eating pets.\n\n\"The media has tried to say now for days that I've made up this story. I haven't made up anything,\" he said. \"I've just listened to people who are telling me these things.\"\n\nLater, he was asked if his rhetoric over migrants from eating pets caused bomb threats to be called in in Springfield. In response, he said the bomb threats were being called in from foreign countries, and again changed the topic to censorship.\n\n\"It's moral blackmail in the favor of censorship, and I reject it,\" he said.\n\nVance has spoken to Trump about abortion\n\nDuring the debate last week, Trump was asked whether he would sign a federal abortion ban, something Vance had said Trump would do as president.\n\nVance said that he and Trump have talked about abortion but had not gone as far as speaking about a federal ban.\n\n\"We have discussed the topic of abortion many, many times,\" he said. \"What we hadn't discussed is a ridiculous hypothetical of a federal abortion ban coming to his desk.\"\n\nHe called a federal ban \"media bait.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't discuss things that aren't actually going to become law in this country. So when he says, 'I think that abortion should be a state's issue,' and he says 'I'm not backing a national abortion ban,' then that should be enough to end the discussion,\" Vance said.\n\nImmigration issues were a big focus at the Eau Claire event\n\nAsked about a key local issue in western Wisconsin — the closure of several hospitals and clinics — Vance blamed immigration as a driver of the problem.\n\nWhen he was asked about what the Trump administration would do to address the closures, Vance said rural facilities such as those in western Wisconsin shut their doors because they were \"bearing the burden of providing health care to millions of people who shouldn't be in this country to begin with.\"\n\n\"Now you might not think that rural health care access is an immigration issue. I guarantee it is an immigration issue, because we're bankrupting, bankrupting a lot of hospitals by forcing these hospitals provide care for people who don't have the legal right to be in our country,\" he said. \"We've got to stop that. Kick these illegal aliens out, focus on American citizens, and we will do a lot to make the business of rural health care much more affordable.\"\n\nPrairie du Chien used as an example of open-border policies\n\nVance also attacked Harris and Walz on immigration, calling out Harris' \"open borders\" and Walz's \"sanctuary city.\"\n\nHe used as an example Prairie du Chien, where an assault by an immigrant with potential gang ties has been singled out by Republicans as an example of the Biden administration allowing dangerous people into the country at border crossings. U.S. Senate hopeful Eric Hovde and U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden have kept the issue in the press recently in interviews with Fox News.\n\n\"He went to this small Wisconsin town and committed sexual assault against a mother and a young child,\" Vance said. \"He should have never been in this country, ladies and gentlemen, and when Donald J Trump is president, all of them are going home. We're going to deport the criminal migrants in this country.\"\n\nAccording to information from Crawford County authorities, Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, of Venezuela, was arrested in early September in Prairie du Chien after assaulting a person who was known to him. He was charged with domestic disorderly conduct, two counts of domestic battery, strangulation/suffocation, physical abuse to a child, disorderly conduct and two counts of second degree sexual assault.\n\nPolice found that Coronel Zarate had a warrant for his arrest in Dane County, and had ties to a gang in Venezuela, something police confirmed based on tattoos on his body.\n\nDemocrats criticize Vance's missed vote on IVF\n\nIn a call ahead of Vance's visit, Democrats slammed the Ohio senator's choice to skip a vote in Washington, D.C., on establishing a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization for those struggling to conceive a child.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, one of the sponsors of the legislation, highlighted during the call that her two daughters were born thanks to IVF.\n\nThe bill was scheduled to be on the floor Tuesday afternoon, just hours before Vance was expected in Eau Claire.\n\n\"But we know exactly how he would vote, because he voted against this bill just a couple of months ago,\" Duckworth said. \"Donald Trump and JD Vance have spent weeks lying about their records on IVF and pretending to champion this cause, but we know time and again, when given the chance, they'll never actually do anything to support IVF.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, also slammed Vance.\n\n\"He also wasn't here to vote on the Child Tax Deduction, after saying it was so important to support families with children,\" Stabenow said. \"He was a no show, just like he's going to be today.\"\n\nTrump has pledged to preserve IVF, announcing at a town hall in La Crosse earlier this summer that he wants the government or insurers to fully cover the cost of IVF treatment.\n\nAt the Eau Claire event, Vance called the bill \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Did Kamala Harris and Chuck Schumer come together and produce a bipartisan bill? No, they shoved through a vote today knowing it would have no chance of passing because they wanted to be able to say, we support IVF and the other guys don't,\" he said. \"But that's not a real support of IVF, that's political showmanship and I think Wisconsinites are sick of it. Let's do real legislation and real policy in this country, not these ridiculous show votes.\"\n\nVance blames political rhetoric for Trump assassination attempts\n\nVance said it was time for everyone to cool their political rhetoric, but especially Democratic politicians and campaigns. He pledged to do what he could to help tone down the heated atmosphere.\n\n\"I promise you that I will do my part to lower the temperature because we don't want anybody to get hurt in our politics, whether they're Democrats or Republicans,\" he said. \"In the past two months, two separate people have tried to take Donald Trump's life. Yes, we need to tone down the political rhetoric, but that especially applies to the Democrats. Stop the craziness, stop the violent talk, and let Donald Trump go out there and make his case to the American people.\"\n\nVance's Tuesday appearances are his first since the second attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, this time at Trump International Golf Club in Florida on Sunday. The attempt was thwarted when Secret Service agents walking the course ahead of the former president spotted a gun barrel in the bushes. The agents opened fire, causing the man to flee. Suspect Ryan Routh was arrested later that day, and appeared in federal court Monday.\n\nVance says western Wisconsin is important for campaign win\n\nAfter speaking to supporters, Vance took questions from local reporters, the first being why he came back to Eau Claire for the second time in recent months.\n\n\"Wisconsin is one of the most important states in the country, and this is one of the most important parts of the state of Wisconsin, because we know that we're going to win a lot of voters here,\" he said.\n\n\"I've been in politics all of two years, but this is not rocket science. You do two things in a political campaign — you try to persuade swing voters, and then you try to get out the people that are going to vote for you. You try to make sure they get to the polls. And we're doing both things here today. We're trying to take a message to swing voters that it could be so much better.\"\n\nLaura Schulte can be reached at leschulte@jrn.com and on X at @SchulteLaura.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html", "title": "Natural gas bans: 20 states have laws that prohibit cities from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/14/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-china-red-note-donald-trump-joe-biden/77689500007/", "title": "TikTok ban in U.S.: What will happen to app if it is removed?", "text": "Will TikTok see its end in the United States this coming Sunday?\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments on Friday over whether TikTok can be banned in the country beginning Jan. 19 and now Americans are eagerly awaiting their verdict.\n\nThe Chinese-owned platform has raised questions over the years for allegedly harvesting data for those who have the app installed and use it frequently. TikTok stated it uses a separate, U.S.-based entity to store its American user data. CEO Shou Zi Chew has repeatedly sat before Congress and denied the app shares U.S. user data with the Chinese government.\n\nHere's when Floridians could see TikTok disappear from app stores and what comes after a possible ban.\n\nIs TikTok going to be banned?\n\nAs of Jan. 14, SCOTUS has not revealed its verdict. The court could release its decision at any time.\n\nAccording to experts, the court seems likely to allow the ban to come into effect based on national security. The justices reportedly spent more time going against TikTok’s arguments than they did with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who was defending the sell-or-be-banned law passed by Congress last year and backed by President Joe Biden.\n\nWill TikTok still work after a ban?\n\nSuppose ByteDance does not sell TikTok to someone less adversarial than a Chinese company. In that case, the app will be removed from American app stores and U.S. internet service providers will be instructed to block access to the site.\n\nIf you have the app on your phone, it won't disappear, but services may be limited or unavailable, and no further updates will be forthcoming. It's unclear if you'll be able to add new content.\n\nIf you wish to keep a copy of your activity on the app, you may want to do that now.\n\nTikTok Ban:How to backup and download your videos, just in case\n\nCould Donald Trump save TikTok?\n\nPossibly? President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be sworn into office the following day on Jan. 20.\n\nAt the end of last year, he asked the Supreme Court to pause any bans on the app so that his administration, which will begin the day after the deadline when he formally takes office on Inauguration Day, to “pursue a negotiated resolution.”\n\nAt a December press conference, Trump — who currently has nearly 15 million followers on the app — told reporters \"TikTok has a 'warm spot in my heart' and credited the app for growing his relationship with young voters. He also posted his support for the app on Truth Social, writing \"Why would I want to ban TikTok?\"\n\nHowever, he was not always a fan of the social media app. Trump issued the first TikTok ban by executive order in 2020.\n\nHis ban also gave ByteDance a deadline to sell to a U.S. company. While ByteDance was in negotiations to sell to Microsoft and Oracle, the company filed a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the app from being banned and got it, so Trump's ban never went into effect.\n\nBiden later revoked the order and ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app. In 2022, Biden signed a bill prohibiting the app on government devices.\n\nCould TikTok still be purchased by Jan. 19? See potential buyers\n\nYes. And quite a few people are putting their hat in the ring for TikTok.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Chinese officials are considering a plan that would have businessman and Trump ally Elon Musk acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations. However, ByteDance has denied this plan taking place at all.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said in an email to CNBC about Musk taking over, “We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction.”\n\nProject Liberty, an organization led by billionaire Frank McCourt, said it made a formal offer to ByteDance to buy the U.S. assets of TikTok. Project Liberty's President Tomicah Tillemann said in a statement that the organization would not publicly disclose the bid amount.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" host and investor Kevin O'Leary announced last week that he was joining Project Liberty on the purchase plan.\n\nYouTuber Jimmy \"Mr. Beast\" Donaldson also joked about purchasing the app before the ban.\n\nWhat will replace TikTok? Users promote Chinese app 'RedNote'\n\nAs TikTokkers quickly scramble for an alternative to the app, a Chinese app named Xiaohongshu, or RedNote in English, has risen to the top of the list.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book,” features a layout similar to Pinterest and is often described as a Chinese version of Instagram. According to TechCrunch, the app’s focus on short-term content, similar to TikTok, has helped it emerge as a viable alternative.\n\nTiktoker users have shared their experiences on the app, highlighting their positive interactions with Chinese users. The hashtag \"TikTok refugee\" has already garnered nearly 60 million views and over 1.7 million comments.\n\n\"This is the funniest thing to happen with the TikTok ban. TikTok refugees are flocking to an actual Chinese-owned clone of TikTok called RedNote rather than use Meta or YouTube to the point it’s #1 on the AppStore now,\" One user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"It’s wild.

Internet service providers will also be required to make the app inaccessible to U.S. internet browsers.\n\nBut TikTok is not going down without a fight. On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the possible shutdown, but according to experts, the court will most likely decide to allow the ban to come into effect based on national security.\n\nAmong all free iPhone apps, RedNote currently sits as the top social networking app on the Apple app store rankings. Here is what you need to know about RedNote.\n\nWhat is RedNote?\n\nLaunched in 2013, RedNote has become one of China’s fastest-growing social platforms, with a value of over $17 billion, according to the Financial Times.\n\nKnown as Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book,” RedNote features a layout similar to Pinterest and is often described as a Chinese version of Instagram. According to TechCrunch, the app’s focus on short-term content, similar to TikTok, has helped it emerge as a viable alternative.\n\nMake Washington make sense for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nSo what’s the deal with TikTok?\n\nTikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance are attempting to block a law signed by President Joe Biden that will ban the short-form video app beginning Jan. 19, unless it sells its U.S. operation due to national security concerns. The social media giant has requested the Supreme Court to pause the ban during the legal process, and while the justices heard arguments last week, a decision has yet to be announced.\n\nIf the ban takes effect next Sunday, Apple and Google will no longer be able to offer TikTok for downloads for new users, but existing users will still be able to access the app. The U.S. government and TikTok agree that the app would degrade and eventually become unusable over time because companies would not be able to offer support services.\n\nContributing: USA TODAY's Karissa Waddick, Greta Cross and Reuters\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who used the treatment to have two children; Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.; and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. It would have barred states from adding restrictions to IVF and required insurance plans to cover the fertility treatment, but senators failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to move forward with the legislation.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were the only Republicans to support the measure. Schumer switched his vote to oppose the push so that Democrats could return to the legislation later.\n\n“Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable, unimaginable even, that access to a safe and widely used reproductive service like IVF would be put at risk,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “But sadly, after frightening decisions like the one from Alabama, not even IVF is safe in the aftermath of Roe.”\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that embryos used in IVF are children, a decision that came after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. While the Alabama Legislature quickly carved out new rules aimed at protecting IVF providers, the back and forth has created new questions on reproductive health services outside of abortion, including access to IVF, birth control and more.\n\nThe Senate vote came the same day that the Supreme Court threw out a case challenging the legality of mifepristone, known as the abortion pill, and the day after the Southern Baptist Convention voted to oppose in vitro fertilization – illustrating the rapidly shifting landscape of an issue that animates voters across the country.\n\nMost Senate Republicans voted against the bill, which they argue tramples on religious freedoms and would extend beyond IVF. All 49 Senate Republicans signed a statement released Thursday ahead of the vote saying that “Senate Democrats have embraced a Summer of Scare Tactics.”\n\nIt’s “a partisan campaign of false fearmongering intended to mislead and confuse the American people. In vitro fertilization is legal and available in every state across our nation,” they wrote. “We strongly support continued nationwide access to IVF, which has allowed millions of aspiring parents to start and grow their families.”\n\nRepublicans have been pushing an alternative bill that seeks to protect IVF sponsored by Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. They sought unanimous consent to pass that bill on Wednesday, but it was struck down by an objection from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who called it “a PR tool, plain and simple.”\n\nBritt and Cruz’s bill would withhold Medicaid funding for states that enact an outright ban on IVF. It comes as Republicans have said they want to protect IVF but have hesitated to tell states how to regulate the procedure.\n\nDemocrats oppose the Republican bill because they argue states could still pass laws that give embryos the same rights as a child.\n\n“It absolutely is a real solution. It’s the only one that can get 60 votes in that chamber,” Britt said of her bill. “I think it’s critically important that we stop trying to scare women who are looking to experience God’s greatest gift, that is being a mother.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/13"}]}

For the latest news on the storm, view our live updates file for Monday, Sept. 30.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − More than 2 million people remained without power late Sunday across the Southeast in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, including more than 430,000 in North Carolina, where the deadly storm pulverized homes, trapped residents, spawned landslides, and submerged communities under raging floodwaters.\n\nAt least 90 people have died across multiple states since the record-breaking storm hit Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds Thursday, before moving north through Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas and weakening to a post-tropical cyclone. The death toll is expected to rise.\n\nOn Sunday, North Carolina officials were still trying to grasp the level of devastation. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference that at least 11 people died in the devastated state, \"and tragically we know there will be more.\"\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said more than 1,000 people were reported missing through the county’s online portal but added that she expected the number to drop dramatically when cell service is restored. Rescue crews are “still trying to save every single person we can” in the hard-hit community, Pinder said.\n\nHundreds of roads were washed away, cellular service for over 250,000 people was cut off, and vast swaths of cities such as Asheville were left underwater. Cooper said Helene had become \"one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.\"\n\nOfficials said earlier that more than 200 people had been rescued in the state by water and helicopter crews.\n\nRyan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, said the wreckage was overwhelming. \"We have biblical devastation through the county. We’ve had biblical flooding here,” Cole said.\n\nDeaths in eastern Tennessee as communities remain underwater\n\nAt least two people in eastern Tennessee have died due to the recent devastation caused by Helene, officials said Sunday. One death was confirmed in Unicoi County and the other in Johnson County.\n\n\"We do expect this number to change,\" spokesperson Myron Hughes of the Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency said during a 5 p.m. news conference. Tennessee officials reported that 153 people were still unaccounted for in the state as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMany communities across eastern Tennessee were still underwater and coping with crumbled roads, unsteady bridges, and devastated utility systems. The remnants of Helene brought rivers to record levels and forced evacuations.\n\nLocal schools remained closed, including Carter County Schools which will likely be closed \"for an indefinite period of time due to the ongoing disruptions,\" count spokesperson Ivan Sanders said. In Elizabethton, Sycamore Shores Hospital had shut down but nearby hospitals were up and running, according to Sanders.\n\n— Areena Arora, Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nPower returning to many in North Carolina, but drivers hindering repair efforts\n\nCooper said the number of customers without power is down from more than 1 million to 464,000 on Sunday afternoon, and efforts are underway to restore cellphone service to the thousands without it.\n\nAttempts to provide relief and make repairs are hindered by residents driving in areas impacted by the storm, state officials said at an afternoon news conference, urging people to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in western North Carolina remains limited and dangerous,\" Cooper said, pointing out 280 roads are closed, including sections of I-40 and I-26. \"Please stay off western North Carolina roads.\"\n\nThe governor said Helene dropped 10 to 29 inches of rain on the mountains in parts of the state, resulting in life-threatening landslides and floods. That has prompted reports of up to 1,000 missing, and for some of their loved ones to go searching for them.\n\n“I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about relatives and friends they cannot get in touch with,’’ Cooper said. \"It’s one of the reasons we’re pushing so hard to get communications back up because we know a lot of these people are just simply out of communication and are OK.\"\n\nLines for gas and cash in flooded Ashville\n\nResidents in Asheville were scrambling for resources after widespread flooding and power outages caused gas and water shortages. Gas stations began to close on Sunday and businesses started to only accept cash, as many remain unable to process credit and debit purchases due to lack of power and spotty internet service.\n\nIn West Asheville, amid the distant clatter of chainsaws cutting through downed trees, a line gathered at BJ's Food Mart for its 9 a.m. opening. When the cash-only gas station and market opened, screams across the street could be heard: \"No gas! Cash only! No gas!\"\n\nIn downtown, an hour-and-a-half-long line had formed at the Wells Fargo building ATM. Residents were piling in to get cash for groceries, water, and gas. Some were trying to get out of town and others just wanted enough cash for the coming days.\n\n\"We came downtown looking for gas,\" Stephan Amann told the Asheville Citizen-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We were in line for one of the gas stations on Merrimon, but they ran out before we got there, which was inconvenient.\"\n\nAmann and his partner, who live in North Asheville, wanted to leave town but found no better options. \"We've tried, but it looks like there's really nowhere to go,\" he said.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nHelene the latest in increasing $1 billion-plus disasters\n\nThe U.S. has averaged eight yearly disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damage since 1980. But in the last five years, the number of such catastrophes has more than doubled to 18.\n\nHelene is only the latest, and the cost of its damage is estimated at between $15 billion and $100 billion.\n\nScientists who study the Earth's climate and weather say storms like Helene are more likely to occur in the future, prompting an insurance crisis as insurers reduce coverage on some markets – most notably Florida for storms and California for wildfires – or withdraw from them altogether.\n\n\"Natural disasters are natural disasters,\" said Ian Maki, an innkeeper in Cedar Key, Florida. \"But these don’t feel natural anymore.\"\n\nDaughter 'powerless and helpless' trying to reach her parents\n\nAs Helene battered the Southeast, LaNette Wimer sat on hold with the Red Cross for two hours Sunday morning more than a thousand miles away in Denver.\n\nWimer, 59, was searching for information about her parents, Don and Brenda Holmer, who have lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, for the past 25 years. Hendersonville is south of Asheville, where Helene swept through leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe last time Wimer spoke to her family they made no mention of the coming storm, and she worries her parents, who do not have cellphones or internet access, were caught unprepared. When the storm hit, Wimer began frantically watching the news, scouring social media, and calling her parents’ landlines, getting no answer.\n\nShe said the Red Cross has agreed to do a wellness check, which could take up to 48 hours. Unsure where else to turn, Wimer said she’s been left with \"a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear, a lot of wondering.\"\n\n\"How are they eating? Do they have water? Do they have their medications?\" Wimer wondered. \"You just feel so powerless and helpless. Other than reaching out to anything I can find online, there's nothing I can do. It's very scary.\"\n\nNorth Carolina residents trying to connect with family members may call NC 211 (or 1-888-892-1162 if calling from out of state) to report missing loved ones. People in the affected areas can alert others that they are safe by checking in on Facebook crisis response or reporting themselves safe through Red Cross Reunification by calling 1-800-ED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767).\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

His department planned \"welfare checks\" at homes to check those individuals.\n\nHelene wiped out large parts of Asheville, including businesses in the beloved River Arts District. Overlooking the district, the Riverlink Bridge, a central gateway between downtown and West Asheville, has become a sort of hub for gathering as residents reel from the historic damage caused by Helene. The French Broad River crested at a record 24.67 feet Friday and was still well above its banks at 12.68 feet Sunday around noon, according to NOAA.\n\nErin Quevedo, the owner of Balm Salon on Depot Street, was ankle-deep in mud attempting to save what she could of her business.\n\n\"The salon was completely destroyed. It looks like the water came up to about five feet inside,\" Quevedo said. Five hair stylists worked at the salon along with her.\n\n\"Right now, all we're doing is we're trying to salvage what we can,\" she said, noting that only a few things, such as hairstyle tools, were salvageable. \"It's really heartbreaking. I'm not really sure what we're going to do. I think it's just kind of one step at a time.\"\n\nOn Tennessee-North Carolina border, ravaged homes and roads\n\nERWIN, Tenn. − In parts of Appalachian eastern Tennessee near the North Carolina border, the damage from Helene’s deluge was evident Sunday in washed-out bridges, closed roads, destroyed buildings and lack of power for some residents.\n\nUnicoi County officials said restoring power could take weeks. Some residents said they had relatives who were still missing.\n\nAt a church shelter in Greeneville run by the Red Cross, volunteers made pancakes early Sunday for a handful of people still sleeping on cots after being forced from their homes. In Erwin, a town of about 6,000, those impacted by the storm streamed into a local high school serving as a shelter to get hot food, bottled water and clothing. Many were trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nDire situation taking a mental toll\n\nMany Asheville, North Carolina, residents expressed concerns over access to water as grocery and convenience stores have rapidly run out of supplies. Grocery stores have metered customer entrances, and the city and county had yet to establish water distribution sites as of early Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrandi Hayes, 37, and four of her children stood in a long, snaking line of more than 100 people outside the Ingles Markets in west Asheville on Sunday, hoping to buy water, bread, and other essential food items. This was one of the few open grocery stores they could find.\n\nHayes ran out of water Saturday morning and said she's gathered water from a nearby creek to flush the toilet. She tried to call her 18-year-old daughter, a student at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, to let her know she was OK, but there was no answer.\n\nHayes' 12-year-old son tried to console her as she broke down in tears and acknowledged the mental toll the disaster was taking on them.\n\n“We keep talking about (what) we’re thankful for,” Hayes said. “Some people don’t have homes.”\n\n− Jacob Biba and Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nIn West Virginia, fretting about daughter in North Carolina\n\nIn West Virginia, where the storm has left more than 35,000 homes and businesses without power, Twyla Bosley is waiting to hear back from her daughter, Sorida Gain.\n\nGain was riding out the storm in Marion, North Carolina, with her boyfriend, James McKinney, their dogs and chickens. Bosley said the last time they spoke Gain, 40, told her floodwaters had started to breach their basement.\n\n“That's been the last thing I've heard,” Bosley said. “I mean, I lost count of how many missing-person reports I made. I’ve been in contact with the sheriff's department in Marion and nothing yet.”\n\nBosley said she’s trying to stay positive, knowing that the lack of cell service and internet access is likely what’s preventing her daughter from reaching out. Still, she can’t help but worry after seeing images of the widespread flooding in Asheville, less than 40 miles southwest of Marion.\n\n“My mind goes to the worst-case scenario, you know, what if something did happen to her? What if she got trapped there?” Bosley said. “My daughter has a major fear of flood waters. She's scared to death of ‘em. I'm just hoping that she got away.”\n\nA scramble for survival:No time for shoes as Asheville family flees by boat, fearing they lost everything\n\nOver 2 feet of rain swamps North Carolina mountains\n\nOver 2 feet of rain had fallen across North Carolina's mountainous region in recent days because of a rare confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. before Helene arrived in Florida on Thursday night.\n\nTiny Busick in Yancey County along the western border with Tennessee, recorded 29.58 inches in just 48 hours. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate. The historic Biltmore Village nearby was nearly submerged after Helene tore through the area, according to aerial footage.\n\nAt least 5,000 emergency calls to 911 were fielded since Thursday. And with more than 200 North Carolinians requiring rescue following Helene’s torrential rains, local, state and federal officials mobilized to help. Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nThousands of National Guard Troops deployed\n\nThousands of members of the National Guard have been mobilized to join search and rescue missions and clear debris after Helene battered the Southeast.\n\nThe bulk of National Guard members were deployed in Florida, where 3,900 were stationed across 21 counties to offer humanitarian relief and security as well as cleaning up debris and rescuing residents from rising floodwaters.\n\nHundreds more were activated in Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and Tennessee, where members rescued 50 patients and staff from a hospital in Unicoi County who were trapped because of extreme flooding.\n\nMadison County, Florida, residents recall horrors of Helene\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall around 11:10 p.m. Thursday just east of the Aucilla River's mouth, roughly 40 minutes south of Madison County, Florida.\n\nWinds ripped the roof off Kenneth Butler's home, which had just been fixed after Hurricane Idalia damaged it last year. During Helene on Thursday, \"it sounded like someone was grabbing tin and just throwing it everywhere,\" he said.\n\nWater drenched the home as the storm raged on. All he and his family could hear was the sound of a train whistle.\n\nDoreen Gross and the five grandchildren who live with her did not take any chances. Gross said her boss had a fully furnished, unoccupied house he was planning to sell and let them stay in it for the storm.\n\nBut the home's sturdy walls didn't shield them from the wails of the winds. \"The whole house was rattling, (the kids) were all scared,\" Gross said. \"We were all bundled together.\"\n\nIt was the scariest thing she had ever seen, Gross said − and she survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Looking outside Thursday night was like watching a scene from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" she said.\n\n− Elena Barrera, the Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBiden briefed on Hurricane Helene impact\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for North Carolina and ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts. Biden also approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee as local officials warned the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was on the brink of failure and urged about 100,000 residents to seek higher ground. Hours later, the National Weather Service ended its \"flash flood emergency,\" but a flood warning was still in effect.\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday, the White House said, as part of the administration's effort to speed support to survivors and deploy more search and rescue teams to \"accelerate recovery efforts\" in North Carolina.\n\nHow many people are without power?\n\nThe worst power outages from Helene were in South Carolina, where nearly more than 761,000 homes and businesses were in the dark as of 11 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nIn Georgia, more than 583,000 were without power, in addition to about 432,000 in North Carolina. Florida also had more than 137,000 customers without electricity, and Virginia had over 104,000.\n\nAuthorities have warned it will take days for services to be fully restored.\n\nWhy was Helene so destructive?\n\nForecasters began warning last Tuesday that a confluence of weather patterns was coming together that would likely soak the Southeast and even farther north. A front overhead was going to interact with a plume of moisture being pulled in ahead of Helene.\n\nThe rain \"started well ahead of the storm, training up from the Gulf into our area, and circulation around the storm pushed moisture up from the extremely warm Gulf waters,\" said David Easterling, a rain expert with NOAA's National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit.\n\nInteractions like this, with a band of moisture ahead of a tropical storm or hurricane, are called predecessor events and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. Jet stream winds blowing aloft at more than 115 mph provided lift that further enhanced moisture in the developing storms.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another 6 fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee, and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\n−Dinah Voyles-Pulver\n\nAre other storms brewing in the Atlantic?\n\nForecasters were keeping watch on the Atlantic as hurricane season approaches its last two months.\n\nTropical Storm Joyce, which formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on Friday, was about 920 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands late Sunday and was gradually weakening. There was no threat to land.\n\nHurricane Isaac was about 535 miles north-northwest of the Azores moving over the open Atlantic, hurricane officials said. There was also no current threat to land.\n\nAn 11 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center noted a tropical depression in the eastern tropical Atlantic, currently known simply as \"12,\" is expected to strengthen over the open Atlantic over the next several days.

For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground:How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Center tracking Tropical Depression Joyce, 4 other systems\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state.

Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'Biblical devastation':Helene leaves trail of destruction\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need.

She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived.

Previously, they’ve provided disaster relief following earthquakes in Haiti, a tsunami in Japan and a typhoon Philippines. They’ve led search-and-rescue missions for hurricane survivors along the United State's southern coast and aided during the 2014 Oso landslide.\n\nBut as the novel coronavirus has spread around the world, the Kitsap-based nonprofit has taken on a different kind of mission: responding to a health crisis in their own backyard.\n\n“It's entirely different for us: the people we are serving are not strangers to us,” said Jake Gillanders, the organization’s director. “These are our families and our physicians and our mother and fathers needing these services, too.”\n\nUnlike an acute natural disaster, the pandemic has unfurled in real-time, impacting virtually every community across the country at once. There’s no searching through rubble or rescuing people from rooftops, but the emergencies that come with the outbreak can be just as dire.\n\nAs the virus has upended nearly every facet of life, Empact Northwest is now providing relief wherever it's needed, from delivering groceries to tracking down protective equipment.\n\n“We’ve really engaged every part of our organization,” Gillanders said. ”We've taken on everything we can to try and support the community at this time.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the crew has stepped up to find and distribute protective gear to community health providers, such as family physicians and mid-sized health clinics, which have lower priority than hospitals and long-term care facilities for the equipment.\n\nFunctioning as the “middle man” for local health providers, the organization has already distributed more than 600 N95 masks, 75 Tyvek coveralls and numerous surgical masks as of Friday.\n\nGillanders says those efforts help keep pressure off emergency rooms and hospitals by ensuring community health workers can continue doing their job safely.\n\n\"We want to do our role to make sure we are keeping as many of those people as healthy as possible,” he said. “This is a way for us to keep those front-line health care workers up and running.”\n\nThis week, the organization also sent medical staff and logistics personnel to help operate a new drive-thru testing site established by Kitsap County’s emergency response team.\n\nFounded in 2010, Empact Northwest almost entirely relies on a cadre of volunteers, many of whom (but not all) work as paramedics, firefighters, doctors and nurses. Gillanders himself is the medical officer for the Poulsbo Fire Department.\n\nTo join, members must undergo an extensive half-year training program that prepares them in things like K9 search and rescue, ropes rescue and disaster medical triage. Some are currently volunteering after shifts at the emergency room or days off at the fire station.\n\nHowever, the organization has also taken on new lower-level volunteers to help with other jobs, including grocery deliveries, helping at food banks and conducting welfare checks on residents who are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Last week, the organization received a grant from the Bainbridge Community Foundation to buy groceries for people who are food insecure.\n\nFor the past three weekends, the organization has hosted volunteer training to teach people how to keep a distance, protect themselves and avoid spreading the virus when dropping off groceries or checking on older residents.\n\nOlivia Weeks, an ER nurse who’s transitioning to the military, has been with Empact Northwest for two years. While leading a volunteer training on April 4, Weeks says it’s a “tricky balance” for those who are looking to help but don’t want to spread the virus to others.\n\nIt makes this emergency far different than any other where Weeks has been deployed.\n\n“The strange part is that it's not just one area that needs to be helped,” she said. “It's everyone. It's the whole country, the whole world.”\n\nRon, 58, and Kate Nunes, 52, attended the nonprofit’s training for volunteers at the Gateway Fellowship Church in Poulsbo. The retired couple say they wanted to do something to help their neighbors, and they are healthy and young enough to be “prime candidates.”\n\n“I think we all have a duty to participate if we can,” Ron said. “It's part of being a community.”\n\nThat’s a common sentiment across Kitsap during this crisis, Gillanders said. Although many are doing their part to help simply by staying home, there’s a segment of the population that is eager to help those in need.\n\n“There’s definitely an appetite to serve this community,” he said.\n\nIf you want to volunteer, donate supplies or are in need of non-emergency assistance, visit www.empactnorthwest.org/covid.html.\n\nAusten Macalus is the Kitsap Sun's social services reporter — covering health care, homelessness and how programs are serving those in need.

For the latest news on the storm, read USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, Sept. 27.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Hurricane Helene made landfall Thursday night carrying catastrophic 140 mph winds as the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET near Perry, Florida. Hours later, the system weakened to a Category 1 storm and continued to produce hurricane-force winds as it moved toward Georgia.\n\nBy 3 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said Helene had sustained winds of 80 mph. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said further weakening is expected as the storm moves inland.\n\nAt least one fatality in Florida was blamed on the hurricane so far, authorities said. Officials feared more fatalities would be discovered on Friday, though it would likely be several hours before any rescue personnel could head out to help those in need.\n\nThe storm has already forced closures of schools, airports, and roadways across Florida after Helene rapidly intensified within hours Thursday as it moved through the Gulf of Mexico. More than 70,000 people across four counties – Franklin, Taylor, Liberty and Wakulla – fled under mandatory evacuations as forecasters painted a grim picture of the potential destruction ahead.\n\n\"This will not be a survivable event for those in coastal or low lying areas,\" Wakulla County Sheriff Jared Miller said in a Facebook post. \"There has not been a storm of this magnitude to hit Wakulla in recorded history.\"\n\nForecasters warned that strong, damaging winds will \"penetrate well inland\" across the southeastern U.S. The hurricane center urged people to remain sheltered until Helene fully passed their area, warning that the center of a hurricane is deceptively calm, as hazardous winds rapidly intensify once the eye passes.\n\nHelene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. In anticipation of the storm’s sprawling impact, President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations ahead of Helene's landfall for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama to mobilize federal emergency management resources.\n\n“Helene is a very dangerous hurricane and could become a ‘once-in-a-generation storm’ across western South Carolina and North Carolina, as well as northern and eastern Georgia,” said AccuWeather senior director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin.\n\nNews about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nHurricane Helene tracker:See projected path of 'catastrophic' storm as Florida braces\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp confirmed early Friday that two people died after a suspected tornado touched down in Wheeler County, about 88 miles southeast of Macon. Emergency management authorities in a neighboring county, Jeff Davis county, urged people to shelter-in-place due to high winds in the area.\n\n∎ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed one hurricane-related fatality late Thursday. A car driving on Interstate 4 in Tampa was hit with an overhead road sign.\n\n∎ Helene is the 4th U.S. landfalling hurricane of 2024. Only five other years on record have had four or more hurricane landfalls: 1886, 1909, 1985, 2005 and 2020.\n\n∎ Asheville, North Carolina, more than 400 miles from the landfall location, got 8.34 inches of rain over 26 hours from Wednesday until 4 p.m. Thursday, according to National Weather Service data. The estimated 1-in-1,000- year rainfall for 24 hours in that location is 7.25 inches.\n\n∎ The Florida Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which links St. Petersburg to Bradenton, after winds at the span reached 60 mph and conditions deteriorated.\n\n∎ Florida State and Florida A&M Universities canceled classes but opened their doors to students and Tallahassee residents. The American Red Cross was using FAMU’s Al Lawson Center on campus as a shelter open to the general public; FSU was opening a refugee facility at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center on Thursday to registered students who live off-campus.\n\nHow much damage could Helene do?\n\nIt's too early yet for detailed damage reports from the counties that Helene ripped across. But the National Hurricane Center says Category 4 storms threaten well-built framed homes with \"severe\" damage, potentially losing both roofs and walls. Most trees are snapped or uprooted and power poles are downed.\n\n\"Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\" the hurricane center says of Cat 4 storms.\n\nMore than one million utility customers in Florida were without power by midnight, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker. The number was expected to rise as Helene moved further inland.\n\nIn addition to hazardous winds, the system is expected to bring tornadoes, life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to large swaths of the Southeast, with widespread totals of 6 to 12 inches. Isolated areas could be deluged with 20 inches of rain.\n\nAt midnight in Tallahassee, the storm had significantly intensified, with sheets of rain gusting from the sky. Electricity service in some of the city flickered intermittently.\n\nRainfall was also lashing Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and the Carolinas have declared states of emergencies as the fast-moving storm barrels through the Florida coast.\n\n\"We will likely avoid the brunt of this storm, but it is still expected to bring flooding, high winds and isolated tornadoes,\" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. \"Take proper precautions and monitor local forecasts.\"\n\nIn central Georgia, local news outlets reported that two people were dead after a mobile home overturned in a suspected tornado Thursday.\n\n– Christopher Cann, Doyle Rice\n\nLearn more on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale and the dangers of storm surge.\n\n'They’ve got to get out': Some residents ignore evacuation order\n\nFor some people, even the threat of \"unsurvivable'' storm surge is not enough to convince them to leave their homes. A Florida official from Helene's projected path finds that quite frustrating.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, whose jurisdiction covers St. Petersburg and Clearwater, admonished residents who refuse to heed an evacuation order when he held a Thursday morning news conference as Helene zeroed in on Florida's northwest coast.\n\n“We’ve got a problem, and the problem is that way too many people in Zone A aren’t listening,” Gualtieri said. “We’ve been out there this morning, there’s just way too many people in the area.”\n\nA storm surge of 5-8 feet is predicted for the county, putting residents of barrier islands and low-lying coastal areas in danger.\n\n“They’ve got to get out,'' Gualtieri said, \"and there’s going to reach a point where you’re on your own because we’re not going to get our people killed because you don’t want to listen to what we’re saying.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nSheriff takes grim tack with evacuation holdouts\n\nIn Taylor County, Florida, where Helen’s storm surge is forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet high, the sheriff’s office posted a message Thursday morning for residents who weren’t heeding the county’s mandatory evacuation order.\n\n“If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the message said. The post also asked residents staying behind to send an email to the office with their names, addresses, contact information and the number of people and pets at the location.\n\nThe small rural county on the state’s gulf coast was the site of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August 2023 and Hurricane Debby’s landfall in August.\n\nGene Taylor, a former public official in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall there in 2005, has another message he gives to people considering riding out a potentially deadly storm surge. “Have life jackets and an ax, in case they have to chop through the attic roof to get out.”\n\nMany people were rescued from rooftops when the water rose after Katrina and in other locations after severe flooding.\n\n− Dinah Pulver Voyles and Doyle Rice\n\nHead of FEMA to take first-hand look at storm impacts\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit Florida on Friday to assess the impacts of the storm and report back to Biden.\n\nCriswell said she would fly as close as she could to Tallahassee and meet with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his team. The FEMA leader said she would like to take an aerial tour if possible so she can see the damage for herself. Afterward, she is prepared to move up to Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, also expected to be heavily affected by Helene.\n\n\"Me being on the ground helps me validate some of the damage more quickly, so we can get major declarations in place faster,\" she told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday, adding the agency has the resources it needs to respond to this disaster.\n\nCriswell said FEMA has aggressively deployed resources in advance of Helene's arrival and advised those likely to be impacted to do the same, both in Florida and across inland locations far from the storm's landfall. Parts of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and the Appalachians could get up to 20 inches of rain and experience widespread flooding.\n\n\"Take the storm seriously,'' Criswell said. \"People in Hurricane Helene's path, you need to listen to your local officials. If they tell you to evacuate, please do so, and if they tell you to shelter in place, then that's what you should do. They're going to give you the best information that you can do for your specific situation. Those decisions can save lives.\"\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nDespite pleas from grown children, couple choose to stay\n\nAs the storm rolled closer to the coast, a small number of people in St. Marks made last-minute preparations amid steady rain and increasing wind.\n\nJohn and Melissa Hines, who own and operate the Sweet Magnolia Inn near the water’s edge, piled all of the furniture on their ground floor onto tables and moved a massaging armchair onto the landing. They were planning to stick around until the storm hit, then relocate to their son’s apartment about a mile up the road on higher ground.\n\nLegend has it their pre-WWII building was built using old railroad tracks from the line that used to serve the area, and it has withstood multiple hurricanes, John Hines said, though different storms have left their marks.\n\n“The building will remain. What we have to work with after remains to be seen,” he said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe couple have four children, and the three who do not live nearby have been urging them to leave the area more quickly, Melissa Hines said. One of them, she said, even called their pastor in Ohio, who then reached out to add his encouragement.\n\n“Our faith is great,” Melissa Hines said, explaining why they aren’t seeking safety further from the storm. “Our pastor called and said, ‘Your kids are worried, you need to be wise. Stop being so stubborn.’ So we are going to leave but we’re going to stay close to home.”\n\nHelene could bring three times the rain it takes to cause landslides\n\nHelene is forecast to bring as much as 15 inches of rain to western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains − well over the accepted threshold of 5 inches needed to trigger dangerous and potentially deadly landslides.\n\nAccording to Brad Johnson, environmental science professor at Davidson College north of Charlotte, \"Scientists established some thresholds in North Carolina in the wake of the 2004 Peeks Creek landslide, the deadliest in North Carolina in 60 years.\"\n\nThat slide, triggered by rains from Hurricane Ivan, killed five people. Johnson's group looked at weather data from that slide and found that 5 inches was roughly the threshold for landslides to occur, he said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nManatees could be left stranded by Hurricane Helene\n\nFish, birds and other animals are all impacted differently by storms, depending on their habitat, food sources and other factors, wildlife experts told USA TODAY.\n\nManatees may become stranded or injured by debris from Hurricane Helene. In years past, they have been discovered after hurricanes in a dry bay, in a golf course pond and a retention pond. However, larger sea creatures like sharks and whales have likely been able to swim away from Hurricane Helene quickly, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nAfter Hurricane Idalia in 2023, flamingos from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula ended up in the U.S., in places they had never been seen before, including Missouri and Kansas.\n\nWhen fish die during a hurricane, the most common reason is low oxygen levels in water that has been pushed up from the bottom and may contain lethal hydrogen sulfide. Also, if there are long stretches of cloudy days amid a storm, oxygen-producing organisms and plants can't photosynthesize, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nRiding it out on a fishing boat\n\nIn Saint Marks, 30 miles south of Tallahassee where two rivers meet before emptying into Apalachee Bay, a handful of residents and business owners watched the water rising by several inches every 30 minutes on Thursday. Stone crab fisherman Philip Tooke, 63, stood on the dock of his family owned Saint Mark’s Seafoods, watching the rain and for signs the wind direction was changing.\n\nHe’s had head-height floodwaters beneath his building several times over the years, but he's worried what a 15-foot storm surge would mean. He and his brother planned to ride out the storm aboard their fishing boats.\n\n“I feel sorry for them to the east, but if we don’t get that direct hit we’ll be OK,” Tooke said. “It ain’t got ‘bad bad’ yet. It will be by tonight. It’s not going to be pleasant down here.”\n\nFlights canceled, airports closed\n\nNearly 1,200 U.S. flights were canceled by early Thursday because of Hurricane Helene, according to FlightAware. Tampa International Airport, St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport and Tallahassee International Airport in Florida all announced they will be closed for the day, but the storm's impacts extend beyond its projected path. Airlines began offering travel waivers earlier this week so customers could reschedule their plans around the storm.\n\nAnyone whose flight was canceled is eligible for a refund under Department of Transportation rules. Federal laws do not require airlines to compensate travelers for delayed flights, but carriers have committed to various degrees of compensation for significant delays within their control.

Because some are staying through the storm, so will he. His church is fresh from a roof repair done Wednesday in preparation for Helene. Now, he says, it's ready to keep anyone dry who needs a place to stay as the hurricane bears down on their town.\n\n\"We're going to trust the Lord − no matter,\" Nawlin said. \"He didn't ask us to understand everything. Just trust.\"\n\nMost Florida schools cancel classes\n\nMost Florida schools were closed Thursday ahead of Hurricane Helene’s landfall, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. The Florida Department of Education issued a news release with a list of school closures, and the department said it’s working closely with districts to get them the resources they need to resume normal operations as soon as possible.\n\nThe University of Florida in Gainesville was closed Thursday, and Florida A&M University and the New College of Florida closed earlier this week, through Friday, according to the education department’s statement. At least 33 other colleges and universities are temporarily shutting down their campuses, according to the Florida Department of Education.\n\nDozens of school districts across the state are also closed, affecting K-12 students, as the entire state is blanketed in hurricane and tornado watches.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nFlooding begins along southwest, central Florida coast\n\nFloodwaters began to inundate roads along the central and southwest coast of Florida on Thursday morning. In communities including Fort Myers Beach, Sarasota, Venice, Bradenton and several in the Tampa Bay area, officials have announced road closures as heavy rain and storm surge lead to flooding along coastal and low-lying areas.\n\nSanibel city spokesman Eric Jackson, citing widespread flooding across the Lee County island, urged people not to drive on flooded streets. Molly McCollum, a meteorologist with the Weather Channel, captured video of fish swimming on a street in downtown Sarasota.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expects a surge of water several feet high to come ashore along most of the western coast of Florida, with the highest level – 15 to 20 feet – projected to wallop the panhandle and Big Bend coast.\n\n– Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News; Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nCouple in their 80s decide to hunker down\n\nTaylor County Sheriff Sgt. Lee Harden's SUV pulled over Thursday at a home in the Steinhatchee coastal community, in the direct path of Hurricane Helene, after spotting a couple outside a home. Stan Ridgeway, 87, told the officer he's staying.\n\n\"I have to let you know ...\" Harden began, reciting the details about the expected surge. Ridgeway said he knew.\n\nLater, sitting in his living room, with his wife Jean, 81, Ridgeway said he bought his century-old house with its high elevation in mind. Floodwaters from Hurricane Idalia last year did not reach his home. Jean Ridgeway noted that this is the third hurricane since 2023.\n\n\"We didn't use to get hurricanes here,\" she said, then jokingly added: \"I think they discovered this place and they liked it.\"\n\nLesson learned, residents evacuate Horseshoe Beach\n\nHorseshoe Beach has become a ghost town ahead of Helene's anticipated landfall, the last few residents of the coastal community making final preparations before evacuating inland. The town was devastated by Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge. Or worse.\n\n\"We're just trying to get the heck out,\" Judy Paradis said as she and her husband, John, loaded their cars.\n\nAfter last year's experience, residents took the evacuation orders seriously, Judy said. The Paradises had just made Horseshoe Beach their permanent home last year after vacationing in the coastal town for several years. They said they have \"survivor's guilt\" because their elevated condo was spared when so many people lost everything.\n\n\"We try not to complain because we still have our home,\" John said.\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track outages as Hurricane Helene approaches from Gulf of Mexico\n\nSandbox sand pressed into service as storm approaches\n\nEmergency shipments of hurricane supplies have been flowing in all week at the Home Depot in Town ‘n’ Country, a community of more than 85,000 residents bordering the northern shore of Tampa Bay. By Thursday morning, the store’s supply of filled 50-pound sandbags had dwindled from 16 pallets to 3½ pallets, store manager Erica Jarmon said. In fact, those remaining bags were filled with play sand intended for children’s sandboxes.\n\n“Some customers are even using bags of soil out in the garden department. Getting creative – whatever kind of barriers they can actually use,” Jarmon said, standing alongside her remaining sandbags. Other hurricane supplies: included generators, gas cans, flashlights, sump pumps, extension cords, blue tarps, plywood and more, Jarmon said.\n\n“Fans are another big one, especially for mold, mildew, just trying to get any wet walls dried faster,\" Jarmon said. \"Bleach is another big one after the fact.\"\n\n− Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nLongtime resident listening to Helene warnings\n\nThe usually bustling Sea Hag Marina on Florida's targeted Big Bend coast was mostly deserted Thursday ahead of Helene. Bobbi Patterson, 85, was moving anything that could get soaked − rugs, chairs, a sofa − from her home on the Steinhatchee River to another one she owns across the street.

Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.\n\nSenior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri condemned Trump's calls for Gazans to leave as \"expulsion from their land.\"\n\n“We consider them a recipe for generating chaos and tension in the region because the people of Gaza will not allow such plans to pass,\" he said.\n\nTrump offered no specifics on how a resettlement process could be implemented but his proposal echoed the wishes of Israel's far right and contradicted former President Joe Biden's commitment against mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\n'Demolition site'\n\nJust two weeks into his second term, Trump was hosting Netanyahu at the White House to discuss the future of the Gaza ceasefire, strategies to counter Iran and hopes for a renewed push for an Israeli-Saudi normalization deal.\n\n\"It's a pure demolition site,\" Trump, speaking shortly before Netanyahu arrived, said of Gaza earlier.\n\n\"If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that's for sure.

Asked by a radio host earlier this month what “80-year-old Joe” would “tell 50-year-old Joe”, Biden replied: “That I’m still 50 – that’s the first thing I’d tell him. You think I’m kidding. I’m not kidding.”\n\nBut the president has acknowledged that his age may be a worry for voters. During an interview last month with US broadcaster MSNBC, he said: “I could get a disease, I could drop dead tomorrow. I think it’s a legitimate thing to be concerned about, anyone’s age, including mine.”\n\nBiden’s potential 2024 election opponent Donald Trump is no spring chicken either, at 76, yet frequently criticises the Democrat leader over his “performance and his age”, said USA Today’s political correspondent David Jackson.\n\nOther nations have been led be politicians significantly older than Biden, however.\n\nMalaysia’s Mahathir Mohamad set a world record in May 2018, when he became the oldest serving state leader at the age of 92 years and 304 days. He held the top job until March 2020 and is now seeking re-election at the age of 97.\n\nTunisia’s first freely elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, passed away in office in 2019 at age 92. And when Raúl Castro stepped down as Cuban leader last year, he was the ripe old age of 89 – the same age as the current president of Cameroon, Paul Biya.\n\nMichel Aoun was 89 when he stepped down as leader of Lebanon last month, and Palestine’s Mahmoud Abbas is 87.\n\nThe oldest ever UK prime minister was William Gladstone, who was 84 when he resigned in 1894.\n\nWisdom of age?\n\n“Few nations have any upper limit on the ages of their leaders,” wrote Adam Taylor in The Strait Times in 2018. And “when push comes to shove, the few limits there are can be strategically ignored”, he added.\n\nChina’s Xi Jinping embarked on a third term last month at the age of 69, in defiance of Beijing’s informal retirement age of 68 for senior party leaders.\n\nUganda had a 75-year age cap for presidential candidates until 2018, when the limit was scrapped by President Yoweri Museveni. He remains the African nation’s leader at the age of 78.\n\nIn 2015, France debated an upper age limit of 70 for standing for election, after a government-backed report concluded that a cap would open politics to more young people. But the concept “provoked accusations of ageism from MPs”, Newsweek reported.\n\nYet “there certainly are benefits to having older leaders in office”, argued Taylor in The Strait Times. “They can draw on wisdom accrued over decades of high-level decision-making, as well as the accompanying support and name recognition.”\n\nUS voters appear unconvinced. A New York Times/Siena College poll of 849 registered voters in July found that two-thirds of Democratic supporters believed the party should put forward a new presidential candidate in 2024, with 33% giving Biden’s age as their primary reason.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Susan Caskie", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/europe/zelensky-north-east-ukraine-kharkiv-region-intl/index.html", "title": "Zelensky claims significant gains in northeastern Ukraine as key city ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUkrainian officials say the military has made sweeping gains in a counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, with President Volodymyr Zelensky asserting that a key city in the region has been reclaimed by Ukrainian forces and that Russian offensives across the country are being repelled.\n\nZelensky posted a video on his social media accounts with Ukrainian soldiers standing above a building in the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia, which was under Russian occupation for six months, alongside the Ukrainian flag.\n\n“The order is fulfilled.

The unit was left without commanders and communications.”\n\nThe Directorate claimed that Russian soldiers were “calling to relatives with requests to contact the command and find out where they should go next. Some of them ask their wives to contact the hotlines of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Red Cross with the demand to remove them from the territory of Ukraine.”\n\nIt provided no evidence for the assertion.\n\nCounteroffensives on two fronts\n\nWhile the southern front, in Kherson region, looks set to be one of the main theaters of conflict as the war heads towards winter, a new Ukrainian push in Kharkiv could stretch Russian forces across two disparate locations.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia redeployed some forces to the south to bolster its ranks ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region, according to Ukrainian officials and footage of equipment moving through Crimea geolocated by CNN.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelensky thanked units stationed in southern Ukraine what he called “extremely successful hits” on occupying Russian forces, while the simultaneous counterattack was launched in the north.\n\n“The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions for our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and the cities of Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south,” he said.\n\nUkraine continues to press on with its southern counteroffensive; Ukrainian forces are making gains in the south, with the ambitious goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, senior US officials and Ukrainian officials told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe last week has seen the most ambitious ground assaults by the Ukrainians since the beginning of the invasion, following sustained attacks on command posts, ammunition stores, and fuel reserves far behind the front lines, according to geolocation of video and satellite imagery.\n\nThe US has observed Ukrainian forces achieve some success in attacking Russian supply lines, with the intention of cutting off and isolating Russian troops currently deployed west of the Dnipro River, according to a senior US official.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt Vasco Cotovio Yulia Kesaieva", "Amy Woodyatt", "Vasco Cotovio", "Yulia Kesaieva"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/weather/hurricane-tropical-storm-fiona-monday/index.html", "title": "At least 2 dead in Puerto Rico after 'unbelievable' Hurricane Fiona ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: In the storm’s path? Bookmark CNN’s lite site for fast connectivity.\n\nCNN —\n\nAt least two people have died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Fiona, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told CNN, as rescuers scrambled to save flooding victims.\n\nA 58-year-old man died after being swept away by La Plata River behind his home in Comerío, and a man in his 30s died after attempting to fill his generator with gasoline while it was on, setting it on fire, according to Press Secretary Sheila Angleró-Mojica.\n\nThe storm wiped out power to most of the island before crashing into the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Ricans who remember the wrath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 say Fiona might be more destructive.\n\n“It’s unbelievable,” said Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in San Juan.\n\n“A lot of people – more than (during) Maria – lost their houses now … lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,” Gonzalez told CNN’s Leyla Santiago.\n\n“Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house. Gov. Pierluisi also told CNN Monday that damage on the island is mostly rain-related.\n\nBy midday Monday, about 1,000 people in Puerto Rico had been rescued by emergency crews, said Maj. Gen. José Reyes, adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nThe “catastrophic rain that won’t stop” is “the biggest challenge” for responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency Coordingating Officer Robert Little told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday evening.\n\n“The first responders, the local responders, the responders of the government of Puerto Rico, are not able to get out and help those that needed or access the damage like they would like to do,” he added.\n\nCars and buildings are partially submerged in Puerto Rico, which remains lagely without power. Courtesy Pito Hernández León\n\nIntense rain was expected to produce more mudslides and catastrophic flooding through Monday night.\n\nOne hundred first responders from New York will head to the US territory to help as soon as weather allows, Pierluisi said, adding that the governors of New Jersey and California have also pledged to send help.\n\nFiona made landfall Monday morning in the Dominican Republic after crossing onto land a day earlier in southwestern Puerto Rico.\n\nStill, Puerto Rico remains almost entirely under flash flood or flood warnings – nearly five years to the day after Hurricane Maria devastated the territory.\n\nOne area north of the city of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in 24 hours.\n\nRescues were underway Monday in the western Puerto Rican municipalities of Mayaguez and Hormigueros, officials said. The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria.\n\nMeanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week – meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,” the center said.\n\nAt least one death was reported in the heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre, the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory’s environmental agency said.\n\nFiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with winds reaching 111 mph. That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMassive power outages cripple Puerto Rico\n\nA house is deluged Sunday in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Three people inside the home were reportedly rescued. Stephanie Rojas/AP\n\nJust 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday, PowerOutage.us reported.\n\nAnd it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s.\n\nSeveral transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored “gradually,” Pierluisi said in a Facebook post.\n\nOnly 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said.\n\nHurricane evacuees take refuge at a public school in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters\n\nBy late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island’s capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan’s medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island’s most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico.\n\n“The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,” Mellado tweeted Sunday night. “Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need.”\n\nFiona’s latest path\n\nIntense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona could intensify as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean. cnnweather\n\nThe hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country’s emergency management director of operations.\n\nEmergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.\n\nTen electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.\n\n“This is still an emergency event,” and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.\n\nLife-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center.\n\nGET LIVE UPDATES\n\nAs Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic’s northern coast, it’s expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.\n\n“Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nYet another widespread calamity\n\nPower outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered another islandwide blackout after a fire broke out in a power plant.\n\nSome parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island.\n\nSamuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago.\n\nThey were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.\n\nRushing waters easily wiped away a bridge, carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours.\n\nUS President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts.\n\nMore than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA’s associate administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,” Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis.\n\n“We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,” Bink said.\n\n“We’re proactively there – and well ahead of any storm hitting – to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls.”\n\nBiden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would “ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,” a readout of the call said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Holly Yan Melissa Alonso", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Holly Yan", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/26/donald-trump-makes-surprise-visit-meet-u-s-troops-iraq/2376620002/", "title": "Donald Trump makes surprise visit to meet with US troops in Iraq", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump defended his decision to withdraw troops from Syria during a surprise visit to Iraq on Wednesday to meet with U.S. troops, his first encounter with soldiers serving under his command in a combat zone.\n\nTrump's journey, cloaked in secrecy during a government shutdown, comes as he weighs a major reduction in forces in the 17-year-old conflict in Afghanistan.

Bush visited Baghdad in 2003, months after the Iraq War began. Trump has repeatedly faced questions in interviews, including on Fox News Sunday in November, for why he had not yet visited U.S. troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"Two years in, Trump was going to get flak for going or not going,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic presidents. \"And clearly those troops who will hear him will be glad he came.\"\n\nThe president's visit followed bipartisan alarms over a series of abrupt decisions upending U.S. foreign policy. Trump announced last week that he would withdraw troops from Syria, then parted ways with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis days later.\n\nTrump is considering a significant reduction in forces in Afghanistan, USA TODAY and other outlets reported last week. The moves in Syria and Afghanistan were consistent with promises Trump made during his campaign, but they unsettled some lawmakers.\n\nTrump described how he gave military leaders several “extensions” to finish their work in Syria.\n\n“They said again recently, 'Could we have more time?' I said, ‘Nope. You can’t have any more time. You’ve got enough time,' \" Trump said.\n\n\"We’ve knocked them out,\" Trump said of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria. \"We’ve knocked them silly.\"\n\nThere are about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, advising Iraqi forces fighting Islamic State militants who nearly overran the country in 2014. The Iraqi army fled its posts during that onslaught. Sustained pressure from airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition helped Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces turn the militants back.\n\nSmall remnants of Islamic State units remain in Iraq, and the U.S troops there assist American units in Syria battling the terrorist group, also known as ISIS.\n\nThe force in Iraq is a fraction of the 170,000 American forces that fought a countrywide insurgency there in 2007. The withdrawal of U.S. troops was accelerated during the Obama administration, only to be returned to current levels after the rise of ISIS.\n\nTrump maintained that he opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but his own statements before the war contradict that.\n\nIn November, Trump said, \"I’m going to a war zone,” a declaration that followed a decision to skip a pair of military-themed events.\n\nWhile traveling in Paris, Trump canceled a trip to an American cemetery about 50 miles away for an event that marked the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended fighting in World War I. Aides said weather made a helicopter trip too dangerous.\n\nTrump returned to Washington two days later but did not make a visit to Arlington National Cemetery for a traditional Veterans Day event. Trump told Fox News, \"I should have done that,” and he made an unscheduled stop at the cemetery Dec. 15.\n\nVice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Afghanistan last year.\n\nMattis announced last week he was stepping down as defense secretary at the end of February over disagreements with Trump, ranging from Syria to global alliances.\n\nTrump said Sunday that Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over sooner than expected. He is to become acting defense secretary Jan. 1. Trump named Army Gen. Mark Milley as a replacement for Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIn Germany, Trump met with Air Force leaders and then greeted hundreds of service members in a hangar. “Hello folks,” the president said, stretching out his arms.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/04/02/utep-president-heather-wilson-u-s-air-force-secretary-selected/3340249002/", "title": "Heather Wilson selected as UTEP president by UT System regents", "text": "Despite opposition from LGBTQ groups, some Texas legislators, student government leaders, and others, U.S. Secretary Heather Wilson was appointed Tuesday to be the next president of the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\nThe University of Texas Board of Regents voted unanimously to give Wilson the job held the last 30 years by retiring Diana Natalicio, 79.\n\nFrom kindergarten to college, we have education covered: Stay informed about schools with a digital subscription to the El Paso Times\n\nWilson will take over as UTEP president Aug. 15. She is scheduled to leave her post as Air Force secretary May 31.\n\nWilson, 58, in a statement issued by the UT System, said, “No institution means more to the future of El Paso and Juárez region than UTEP. Its deep commitment to providing access to education and excellence in research is a model for the nation.\n\n\"I look forward to building on the tremendous legacy of President Natalicio and leading this great university toward its bright future,\" she said.\n\nAs the regents voted, Wilson was at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on President Donald Trump’s 2020 budget request for the Air Force and Army.\n\nThe regents' vote came 25 days after they voted to make Wilson the sole finalist for the UTEP presidency, which set off protests by LGBTQ activists from El Paso and UTEP.\n\nLGBTQ groups and others noted some of her votes as a Republican congresswoman from 1998 to 2009 and public statements she has made as being anti-LGBTQ, which they argue disqualifies her from leading a large university with about 25,000 students.\n\nOthers cited some of her congressional votes on education and immigration issues, as well as her limited experience as an academic administrator as reasons to reject her nomination.\n\nFoster voices support for Heather Wilson\n\nPaul Foster, an El Paso businessman and UT System regent, said just before the vote that \"no candidate for a job this important is going to come to us without opposition. I appreciate and respect the comments of those who have voiced their opposition, but I’ve also heard from hundreds of alumni and interested constituents who have voiced their very strong support.\"\n\nFoster said that the appointment was not politically motivated as some have claimed, and that Wilson was appointed president \"based on her merits, her skills and her abilities.\"\n\nBoard of Regents Chairman Kevin Eltife, a Tyler, Texas, businessman, said, “Our job as regents is to select the best possible person to lead an institution, to make it a better version of itself in every way, from academics to the arts, from research to athletics.\"\n\nOpinions differ over new UTEP president\n\nEltife, the Board of Regents chairman, said Wilson's colleagues — \"regardless of political party\" — who worked with Wilson when she was president of the South Dakota School of Mines for four years, as a U.S. congresswoman for six years, and as Air Force secretary for almost two years, \"commended her for her impressive leadership, inclusivity, laser-sharp strategies, focus, and compassionate treatment of all with whom she worked.\"\n\nLaura Diaz-Martinez, associate director of the UTEP Campus Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives — one of five people who urged regents, before they voted, to not appoint Wilson — said 52.3 percent of faculty opposed Wilson's nomination in a recent faculty poll. The others who phoned in to the regents' telephonic meeting to speak against Wilson's hiring were UTEP graduates. A UTEP student, who opposed Wilson, spoke in person in the regents meeting room in Austin, where UT System administrators sat in on the meeting.\n\nOne of those calling in wasd Cristina Calvillo-Rivera, a UTEP graduate and El Paso LGBTQ activist who, the day after Wilson was named the sole finalist, started a Change.org petition opposing Wilson, which now has more than 10,500 signatures. She said just more than 60 percent of those signatures are from the El Paso, Juárez and Southern New Mexico area, based on ZIP codes attached to the signatures.\n\n\"Let's have a leader that will be the example we want to have for our community — not one that will divide and hurt members of our border city,\" Calvillo-Rivera told the regents.\n\nAfter the vote, Calvillo-Rivera said the fact that not one of the regents voted against Wilson’s appointment is “a blatant disrespect for the community. It means they did not care” about concerns from El Pasoans and UTEP students, she said.\n\nThe board has eight voting members, all of whom voted for Wilson, a UT System official said.\n\n'Larger systemic issue' with president selections\n\nCalvillo-Rivera said Wilson’s selection also “points to the larger systemic issue of how (UT System) university presidents are selected and who is involved.\".\n\nA search advisory committee — which included several El Paso businesspeople, including Foster, UTEP faculty, the UTEP student government president, and UT System officials, picked several president candidates — from which the regents chose Wilson. The names of candidates, including those interviewed by the regents, have been kept secret, which is allowed under the Texas Public Information Act.\n\nHiri Ali, leader of the We the Students Coalition at UTEP, formed to oppose Wilson’s nomination, said she and other UTEP students involved in anti-Wilson protests are running in this week’s student government elections as a way to “hold Wilson accountable” by being inside the UTEP system.\n\nWilson, in a March 28 interview with the El Paso Times, said she had not seen what she called a national petition, and she questioned how many of the people who signed it are from the El Paso area.\n\nWilson held a daylong marathon of private meetings March 28 at UTEP. In those meetings, she tried to assure students, faculty, administrators and others that she would continue to honor UTEP's values of being an inclusive university that not only provides college access to a diverse population of about 25,000 students, but also aims to have academic excellence, according to some people who met with Wilson. Those are things that Natalicio has stressed in her tenure as the longest-serving university president in the nation.\n\nWilson failed to change the minds of some of her opponents who protested her nomination. But others, including a member of the UTEP Alumni Association and a UTEP college dean, came away feeling good about having Wilson as UTEP's next president.\n\nMartha Aguayo, an El Paso Realtor and treasurer of the UTEP Alumni Association board of directors, said Wilson convinced her that she'd be \"a great leader for the university and the community.\"\n\n\"I was pleased to hear her embracing what El Paso and UTEP have,\" including saying she would not only focus on the school's binational and bicultural aspects but also expand on them,\" she said after she and other alumni board members met with Wilson last week.\n\nUTEP and El Paso \" have to be supportive and help her,\" Agauyo said.\n\nShafik Dharamsi, dean of the College of Health Sciences, said Wilson was \"very persuasive and authentic\" in telling UTEP college deans about \"her commitment to our (UTEP) values.\"\n\nMore:Heather Wilson visits UTEP to sell herself as the school's next president, draws protest\n\nConcerns over congressional voting record\n\nThe UTEP Student Government Association Senate, after meeting with Wilson for an hour last week, approved a resolution opposing Wilson's nomination because of her congressional voting record. But the resolution conceded that Wilson likely would be the next UTEP president, and it promised the student government would be a \"strong advocate and ally for the students that fear they will be directly impacted by her appointment.\"\n\nAmong her congressional votes, Wilson voted against a bill in 2007 that would have banned job discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2004, voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.\n\nOpponents also cite a vote she made against a bill providing $84 million in grants for Black and Hispanic colleges as not supporting schools like UTEP, with 80 percent of its students Hispanic. Wilson, in a March 11 news conference at UTEP, said she voted against that bill because it would have lowered the amount of federal Pell grants for students from $6,000 per student to $5,800 per student, which, she said, \"matters a lot.\"\n\nState Rep. Lina Ortega, D-El Paso, said in a statement issued after Wilson's appointment that she was disappointed by the regents' selection.\n\n\"I will respond to any discriminatory acts, policies, or practices\" by Wilson \"with immediate public and political opposition,\" she said.\n\n\"I expect UTEP’s future leadership to build on the legacy of Dr. Diana Natalicio by continuing to offer a first-class university experience to all members of the UTEP community in a manner that is welcoming,\" Ortega said.\n\nLast week, two other Democratic state legislators from El Paso, state Sen. José Rodriguez and state Rep. Mary González, issued statements opposing Wilson's appointment.\n\nGonzález leads the the 24-member Texas House LGBTQ Caucus, and after Wilson was named finalist, the group asked regents to do a new, more inclusive search for UTEP's next president. González said a phone conversation with Wilson on March 30 did not persuade her to change her mind.\n\n\"Secretary Wilson struggled to acknowledge how her previous votes and actions as a Congresswoman could be viewed as discriminatory, and was unable to name specific policies she would implement as a university leader to encourage an inclusive learning environment,\" González said in a statement issued last week.\n\nWilson, in her interview with the El Paso Times said, \"There will be no change in the way students and faculty are treated irrespective of their sexual orientation. That is not my intent at all. I've run a lot of large organizations that are very diverse and inclusive, including one I run now, and that will not change.\"\n\nShe said she had \"no apologies for my strength as a (UTEP president) candidate.\"\n\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter\n\nThe El Paso Times isn't just another subscription.

JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off on the debate stage Tuesday, laying out their pitches to voters across the country in the final stretch of the 2024 election.\n\nThe vice presidential picks kicked off the debate by talking about America's role in crises in the Middle East and how the nation should address issues like immigration, inflation and abortion rights. They also explained how they would try to lower housing prices and reduce gun violence in schools if elected.\n\nThe Ohio senator and Minnesota governor actually agreed at several moments in the debate, particularly as they discussed the need to make childcare more accessible for families from coast to coast. But their sharpest disagreement came as they were asked about democracy and the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's latest updates.\n\nVice presidential debate fact check:What Tim Walz, JD Vance get right (and wrong)\n\nBlame it on the nerves\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, addressed Tim Walz's misstep when he talked about gun violence in schools. The governor said on the debate stage “I’ve become friends with school shooters,\" but he appeared to mean that he has become friends with victims of school shootings and their families.\n\n“I think that when you're talking about someone who is trained in this space, such as JD Vance, and you're talking about someone who's not necessarily trained in this space, this was a nerve wracking thing,” she told reporters in the spin room.\n\nShe added: “When you think about it, especially coming in as the Democratic nominee, we know that there was a complete shift of our ticket after a debate, that's a lot of pressure. And so, I mean, I think that, you know, the average person who knows that he didn't become friends with school shooters — half of them have been killed — but nevertheless, I mean, I know that they know that it was a mistake, and I don't think it's a big deal.”\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nVance calls for “new direction” in America in closing statement\n\nVance in his closing statement blamed Harris for increased costs, crime and drug trafficking. He proceeded to hit the vice president, again, for not making the policy changes she’s campaigning on now. “Her policies have made these problems worse,” he charged.\n\n“We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well,” he said.\n\nVance ended on a more optimistic tone, saying that regardless of who Americans vote for, “I’m so proud to be doing this, and I’m rooting for you.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWalz ends on the ‘politics of joy’\n\nWalz closed by talking about Vice President Kamala Harris’ wide coalition, from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. to former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and pop star Taylor Swift.\n\n“They don’t all agree on everything but they are truly optimistic people,” he said.\n\nHe argued Harris is bringing “the sense of optimism” that there can be an economy that works for everybody and “freedom really means something.” Vance, he said, made it clear he would stand with Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nHarris is “bringing us a politics of joy,” he said. “She’s bringing real solutions to the middle class. And she’s centering you at the heart of that.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz says paid family leave would ‘enhance’ workforce\n\nTim Walz said paid family and medical leave would help bring growth to the United States.\n\nWalz said leaders have to make it easier for people to get into child care businesses and to make it affordable for people who need to pay for family care.\n\n“We're still in crisis on this,” Walz said.\n\n“A federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want,” Walz said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance, Walz clash about threats to democracy\n\nJD Vance really didn't answer a question about Trump's ongoing protests of the 2020 election and the subsequent Jan. 6 near-insurrection − and did not answer Walz's direct question about whether Trump really lost the 2020 election.\n\nInstead, Vance said Republicans want to focus on \"the future,\" and accused the Democrats of seeking to censor free speech of people who have criticized the election system. Trump's claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election were rejected by courts across the country.\n\nWalz replied that the threat to democracy is real, and Trump backers wanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence and overthrow the 2020 election. He alleged Trump and his allies are \"laying the ground work\" for more protests and an another attempted overthrow if they lose this election.\n\n“That is a damning non-answer,” Walz told Vance.\n\n\"This has got to stop,\" Walz added. \"It's tearing our country apart.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nVance says more child care options should be available for American families\n\nJD Vance said there is a “bipartisan solution” for paid family and medical leave. Vance laid out how he believes that there should be a family care model “that makes choice possible” – something that Walz seemingly shook his head in agreement with. But Walz stopped agreeing after Vance criticized Harris’ approach to the issue.\n\nVance said federal funding for how child care is promoted should be considered, including for families who seek child care at churches or with neighbors.\n\n“One of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids, that is an incredible burden to put on American families,” Vance said. “We're the only country that does it. I think we can do a heck of a lot better.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance defends Trump over ‘concepts’ of a health care plan\n\nJD Vance defended running mate Donald Trump’s answer on health care from the last debate when asked about Trump’s widely-panned remark that he had the “concepts” of a healthcare plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“You’re not going to propose a 900-page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears,” Vance said.\n\nHe said it also wouldn’t mean anything if Trump had because there would be a debate in Congress over any proposed legislation. Vance pledged in the answer that Republicans would continue to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nTim Walz, a former teacher, said that Trump’s health care answer “cracked me up,” because “my kids would have never given me that.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nVance says 'we have to do better' on gun violence\n\nJD Vance and Tim Walz almost found common ground on one key issue: curbing mass shootings. While both said more needs to be done to protect Americans from mass shootings, both outlined different policies to do so.\n\nVance, who has three children, said a lot of kids are going to experience the terrible epidemic of gun violence.\n\n“Our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff, and we do have to do better,” Vance said, before blaming higher amounts of illegal guns in the country because of smuggling at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHe advocated for more security in schools, saying doors and windows should be stronger. “I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that,” Vance said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\n'We owe it to them to get a fix'\n\nWalz said he and Harris “understand” the Second Amendment and are not trying to take firearms away from Americans. He added that in Minnesota he helped enhance background checks, and noted that there are “reasonable things” that the government can do to curb mass shootings.\n\nBut Walz criticized Vance’s suggestion of increasing security at schools.\n\n“Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills?” Walz said. “They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix.”\n\nWhen asked about supporting an assault weapons ban, Walz said he now supported it after meeting with families of victims of school shootings. He misspoke by saying he became “friends with school shooters” after highlighting how he met with families of Sandy Hook victims.\n\n“I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work,” Walz said. “Protect the Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance wants to “earn people’s trust” on abortion issue\n\nThe GOP has a trust problem when it comes to the issue of abortion, Vance conceded Tuesday. Vance cited the story of a woman who is “very dear to me” who told him “a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”\n\n“I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don’t trust us,” Vance said.\n\nHe went on to argue that he and Trump are doing that by promoting pro-family policies, such as fertility treatments and helping families financially. He also defended Trump’s position that abortion regulation should be left up to the states.\n\nWalz said that leaving abortion up to the states has put pregnant women at risk, citing the case of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after a long delay in getting a procedure to clear fetal tissue from her body that hadn’t been fully expelled after she took abortion bills, according to ProPublica. A medical panel ruled Thurman’s death was “preventable.”\n\nWalz said Thurman’s death is the result of a basic right being “determined by geography.”\n\n“I agree with you Amber Thurman should still be alive,” Vance said.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\nDonald Trump says he'd veto a federal abortion ban\n\nDuring the debate, Donald Trump said he \"would not support a federal abortion ban\" and that he would veto a national abortion ban if he's elected to a second term.\n\n\"IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on X.\n\nTrump has previously said he supports states setting their own abortion rights or restrictions, but his ticket hasn't been clear about whether a Trump-Vance administration would block an abortion ban passed by Congress.\n\nWalz and other Democrats question that, saying Trump would placate his anti-abortion base if he gets back in the White House.\n\n− David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho's winning the debate? We're more than halfway home\n\nHalf-time is over at the 90-minute debate. Vance has had a more confident debate performance so far, but both nominees have laid out their ticket's priorities.\n\nThe CBS moderators kicked off the second half with a question about gun violence.\n\n−David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nVance: I was wrong to call Trump 'America's Hitler'\n\nOnce again, Vance apologized for his past attacks on Trump, including a claim that the then-2016 Republican candidate might become \"America's Hitler.\"\n\n\"I was wrong about Donald Trump,\" Vance said, arguing that he \"delivered for the American people\" during his term in office.\n\nAs for more recent criticism that has just been unearthed, Vance said the Trump administration did not do everything perfectly, and he hopes to help change that.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVance says some of Harris’ economic plan 'sounds pretty good,' but says Americans should question her trustworthiness\n\nJD Vance said that some of Harris’ economic plans “sounds pretty good” – but she could have enacted those plans if she wanted to as vice president.\n\n“If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion,” he said. “The fact that she isn’t, tells you about how much you can trust her actual plans.”\n\nWalz began the back and forth by saying that he and Harris’ proposal to give families with newborns a $6,000 tax credit and their agenda to provide entrepreneurs with up to $50,000 to start small businesses is a “philosophical difference” between the two presidential campaigns.\n\n“He took folks to Mar-a-Lago, said you’re rich as hell, I’m going to give you a tax cut,” he charged.\n\nHe then hit Trump for the up to 20% in tariffs the Republican has said he’d impose on imported goods, which he referred to a sales tax on the American people.\n\nLater in the debate, Vance slapped back, noting that Biden had continued some of the Trump-era tariffs.\n\n“It’s the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden’s record,” Vance jabbed.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWalz calls himself a 'knucklehead,' said he 'misspoke' on Tiananmen claim\n\nTim Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989. Recently unearthed news reports contradict that, indicating that he was still in Nebraska and headed to China to teach high school in August 1989.\n\nAsked about that contradiction, Walz stumbled over his answer, saying he “misspoke” and that he has been “a knucklehead at times.”\n\n“I can get caught up in the rhetoric,” he said.\n\nWalz has repeated the claim for years, beginning a decade ago during a congressional hearing and as recently as February.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz slams Vance for baseless rumors of Haitian migrants eating pets: ‘There’s consequences’\n\nTim Walz criticized JD Vance for spreading baseless rumors that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating pets.\n\n“There's consequences for this,” Walz said, noting Ohio’s Republican Governor, Mike DeWine, said the claims were untrue. “There's consequences.”\n\nHe accused Vance of demonizing migrants coming to the United States because he does not want to solve immigration issues. There hasn’t been immigration reform since the Reagan administration.\n\n“I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point, and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,” Walz said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance says real family separation policy is 'Harris' wide open southern border'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has pledged to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally.\n\nAsked whether that plan would involve separating undocumented parents from their children who were born in the U.S., Vance said “the real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris’ wide open southern border.”\n\nHe argued that thousands children have been lost by the Department of Homeland Security, some of whom have been used as “drug trafficking mules” or been victim to sex trafficking. A Trump administration deportation policy would target migrants who have committed a crime in addition to crossing the border illegally.\n\n“And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers,” he said. “A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country.”\n\nWalz argued that Republicans do not want to solve the border crisis because they refused to pass a Senate-negotiated bipartisan border bill earlier this year.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz slams Trump for calling climate change a 'hoax'\n\nAfter Hurricane Helene ravaged a large swath of the Southeast U.S., Vance was asked what a Trump administration would do to address climate change, which is contributing to stronger storms.\n\nHelene quickly strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane in the unusually warmer water of the Gulf of Mexico and went on to inflict record storm surge flooding on parts of Florida, and catastrophic flood damage in parts of Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nVance said climate change is “a very important issue” and that people “are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns.” He added that bringing more manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. would help limit carbon emissions, and accused the Biden-Harris administration of failing to do that.\n\nWalz responded by noting Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and said it would create more beachfront property, a comment he made in an interview with Elon Musk on X this year.\n\n“Climate change is real, reducing our impact is absolutely critical,” Walz said, pointing to clean energy development in America, such as a solar manufacturing plant in Minnesota, where he serves as governor.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nIn slow debate start, Walz mixes up Israel and Iran\n\nTim Walz got off to a slow start in the debate, accidentally referring to Iran as Israel and Israel as Iran in his first answer of the night, in response to a question about how he would advise the president if he were the last in the Situation Room on a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran.\n\n“Iran, or I uh, Israel’s ability to be able to defend itself, is fundamental,” he said early in the answer.\n\nMoments later, he said, “But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States” to steady leadership there.\n\nIran fired more than 200 missiles into Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for the death of Hezbollah commanders and in an escalation of tensions in the region, prompting the query.\n\nAsked the same question, JD Vance argued that Donald Trump brought “stability” to the world that deterred nations such as Iran from attacks.\n\n“It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe, and we should support our allies wherever they are when they’re fighting the bad guys,” he said of a preemptive strike.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHow long is the VP debate?\n\nVance and Walz's debate, which kicked off at 9 p.m. ET, is expected to last 90 minutes.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWalz hits Trump over age\n\nIt didn't take long for Walz to reference Trump's age − the first response to the first question.\n\nAsked if he would support a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran, Walz began talking about the presidential debate and said that \"a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.”\n\nTrump is actually 78, younger than Joe Biden, but you get the point.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nVance, Walz start debate with a handshake\n\nJD Vance and Tim Walz shook hands at the start of the debate, and the Ohio senator told the Minnesota governor \"good to meet you.\"\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDiet Dew advertises ahead of debate\n\nCBS News aired a commercial depicting a worker wheeling a cart of Diet Mountain Dew into what appeared to be the broadcast center where the debate is being held telling others nearby that \"they\" requested it. At the end of the ad, \"The VP debate starts soon\" flashed on screen.\n\nBoth candidates have expressed their love for the drink on the campaign trail.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nTrump questions brain injuries of US soldiers in Iraq\n\nAs Vance made final preparations, Trump made headlines by appearing to denigrate military personnel with brain injuries.\n\nDuring a news conference in Milwaukee, a reporter asked the former president if he should have been tougher on Iran after more than 100 U.S. soldiers reported brain injuries after a 2020 missile strike on Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq.\n\nTrump began his reply by talking about the soldiers rather than Iran.\n\n\"First of all, injured?\" he said. \"What does injured mean? Injured means, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort?\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nWhat happened during the Trump-Harris debate?\n\nHarris and Trump met for the first time during ABC News’ Sept. 10 debate. A national poll by the outlet found that 58% of Americans thought Harris won the debate in comparison to the 36% who felt she lost to Trump.\n\nThe pair shook hands when they walked out stage, but quickly began sparring over Project 2025 and who presents a threat to democracy.\n\nMemorable moments from the first debate included Harris defending abortion access and Trump pushing false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPete Buttigieg, Tom Emmer step in for Tim Walz and JD Vance debate prep\n\nTim Walz and JD Vance have been prepping for tonight’s debate with the help of some high-profile figures.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg helped out Walz by acting as Vance during mock debates and practice. It wasn’t his first time acting as a Republican vice presidential contender, either. Buttigieg played former Vice President Mike Pence during debate prep for Kamala Harris back in 2016.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer, R-M.N., stood in as Walz, his fellow Minnesotan, for Vance’s debate preparation sessions.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDonald Trump: JD Vance is 'a warrior'\n\nDonald Trump gave a pre-debate shout-out to JD Vance, telling reporters in Milwaukee that his running mate will do well because \"JD is very much a warrior.\"\n\nThe former president also said he gave Vance some advice: \"I said, 'JD, have a lot of fun.'\"\n\n–David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden to Tim Walz: ‘Coach, I got your back’\n\nPresident Joe Biden sent a note of support for Gov. Tim Walz ahead of his face-off with Sen. JD Vance for the vice presidential debate.\n\n“Coach, I got your back tonight!” Biden wrote in a post on X. “Tonight, America will see the strong, principled, and effective leader I’ve known for years—and the contrast you and Kamala provide against the other team.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday would not say whether the president will be watching the debate, saying that he will be “very, very busy” as his administration addresses Iran’s attack on Israel and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n“He has complete confidence in Tim Walz,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nForeign policy top of mind after Iran strike\n\nForeign policy will be front and center during Tuesday’s debate after Iran launched a major missile strike against Israel.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does look like we are getting closer and closer to WWIII,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said. “That is not good for anybody, forget your politics or anything else. So, what's your vision and what's the strategy around global conflict to bring about world peace?”\n\nAlready, Republicans are trying to paint the Biden and Harris administration as culpable for turmoil in the Middle East. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said the attack placed a renewed importance on national security – and she predicted it would be one of the moderators’ first questions.\n\n“That raises the stakes, and it also provides an opportunity for JD Vance to compare the peace through strength, and the peace – specifically in the Middle East – under President Trump, versus this chaos and catastrophe that we're seeing around the world,” Stefanik said.\n\n– Haley BeMiller\n\nGOP lawmaker criticizes Joe Biden's response to Helene devastation\n\nBoth Walz and Vance are widely expected to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene across parts of the Southeast. But another leader, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., criticized President Joe Biden’s leadership ahead of the debate as relief efforts continue.\n\n“I think if there is a concern, the concern is, frankly, is President Biden equipped at this point to lead the federal government at this very perilous time for people in North Carolina and Georgia, in the Panhandle in northern Florida, the Big Bend area and parts of South Carolina and Tennessee? These are serious questions that need to be asked and answered.”\n\nHe continued to tell reporters in the spin room: “And I think a key question for the Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris is ‘can Joe Biden do that job, since he's no longer running for the election?’”– Sam Woodward\n\nTrump changes his mind, turns down '60 Minutes' interview\n\nDonald Trump, who has said he will not debate Kamala Harris again, is also passing up another campaign tradition: A pre-election interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"After initially accepting 60 Minutes’ request for an interview with Scott Pelley, former President Trump’s campaign has decided not to participate,\" the CBS program said in a statement posted on the X social media site.\n\nIn announcing an interview with Harris to air on Oct. 7, \"60 Minutes\" said: \"For over half a century, 60 Minutes has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls.\"\n\nIt added that \"our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands.\"\n\nAsked about the dispute, Trump told reporters in Milwaukee that the program owes him an apology over its coverage of Hunter Biden, particularly materials from his laptop. \"I've asked them for an apology,\" Trump said. \"Let's see if they do it.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTeachers show up to support Walz\n\nGloria Winograd, a music teacher in New York City of 40 years, celebrated the day of her retirement right outside the CBS studio hours before the vice presidential debate.\n\nWinograd, along with a crowd of other teachers who are part of the American Federation of Teachers, gathered around the front of the building in New York City at 4:30 p.m. to show their support for Harris and Walz.\n\nShe said she is terrified of Project 2025 and what's in the document created by a conservative think tank.. “Can you imagine if they get rid of the Department of Education” she said to NorthJersey.com.\n\nThe educator, who has been a part of the American Federation of Teachers for decades, thinks Harris and Walz is the best option for teachers because she said they are “reasonable people.” Over 100 people turned out for the teachers' rally outside the event to chant and listen to speakers. The group started dispersing around 5:15 p.m.\n\n– Lucas Frau\n\nCan JD Vance overcome gender gap among voters?\n\nJD Vance has faced scrutiny for his comments about women and families, including criticism of \"childless cat ladies.” But Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., disputed that he's a liability for the Trump campaign on Tuesday.\n\n\"JD Vance has talked about his personal story, about how important women have been in his life,\" the lawmaker told reporters in New York. \"When it comes to his grandmother to help him set his goals. When it comes to his wife, Usha, who is incredibly well accomplished, graduated top of her class at Yale, is accomplished in her own right.\"\n\nTonight's debate, Stefanik said, is an \"an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about that.\"\n\nRecent polls in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan found women overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump. Stefanik said the campaign has an advantage with male voters and is working to close the gender gap.\n\n\"I'm a believer, as the highest-ranking woman in Congress that all issues are women's issues – so economic issues, as well as border issues, as well as issues related to IVF,” she said.\n\n– Haley BeMiller\n\nWhat are the debate rules?\n\nThe candidates’ microphones will remain live during the debate, even when it is their opponent’s turn to speak, CBS News announced. The live microphones mark a departure from ABC News’ debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump whose microphones were muted when they faced off Sept. 10.\n\nLike the presidential debate, CBS News announced that there will be no live audience for the showdown between Vance and Walz. The network also said the candidates will stand for the event although vice-presidential hopefuls typically sit for their debate.\n\nBoth will be given two minutes to answer questions they will not receive ahead of time and two minutes to respond. They will each be given the opportunity to make a closing statement. Neither will be allowed pre-written notes or props.\n\n– Rachel Barber and Joey Garrison\n\nWalz may have been in Nebraska, not China, during Tiananmen Square protests: Reports\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz's time in China could be a point of contention during Tuesday's vice presidential debate in New York, particularly after recent reports alleged that he may have been misleading about being in the East Asian country around the time of the deadly Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.\n\nWalz has previously stated that he traveled to China for a teaching position in 1989, weeks before the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. He even recalled his time in the country during a 2014 Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing honoring the 25th anniversary of the protests.\n\nDiscrepancies in Walz's account of his travels arose when the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news publication, shared conflicting reports placing the governor in Nebraska around the time of the protests.\n\nThe Alliance (Neb.) Times-Herald featured a photo of Walz touring a Nebraska National Guard storeroom on May 16, 1989. The photo's caption says Walz \"will take over the job\" of staffing the storeroom from a retiring guardsman and \"will be moving to Alliance,\" Nebraska, CNN reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse\n\nWhat time is the debate?

What to know about the Minnesota governor\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz, 60, is Minnesota’s governor.\n\nThe outspoken Midwestern statesman is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party who was elected to run the state in 2018 and won reelection in 2022.\n\nWalz was born in Nebraska in 1964 and moved to Minnesota in 1996. Before he entered politics, Walz served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nA moderate Democrat, he was elected to represent a red Minnesota district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006. He was the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee for two years and served in the chamber until he was inaugurated governor in 2019.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is JD Vance? What to know about the senator, 'Hillbilly Elegy' author\n\nJD Vance is Donald Trump’s running mate and a Republican senator from Ohio. Vance, who served in the Marines, was elected in 2022 with no prior political experience. Still, he has garnered plenty of name recognition from his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nThe book, later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance’s journey from a childhood riddled by drug addiction and abuse to Ohio State University, and a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\n– Rachel Barber and Haley BeMiller\n\nTrump name-calls Walz in hours before the debate\n\nTrump's personal insults against his Democratic rivals hit a new low Monday when he described Walz as a \"moron.\"\n\nThe latest rhetoric from the ex-president – who this past weekend called Harris \"mentally impaired\" – came as he argued that tonight's debate will be \"rigged\" against his running mate, Vance.\n\nTrump has long attacked Walz for his description of him and Vance: \"Weird.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCalm before the storm\n\nHours before JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to go head-to-head in their only scheduled debate, a small number of protestors lined the sidewalk out of CBS Studios in New York City. Around 40 pro-Harris demonstrators gathered holding signs and chanting for the vice president and the Minnesota governor.\n\nDown the block, a handful of pro-Trump supporters stood with signs and flags, including the Israeli flag and calling for peace in the Middle East.\n\nA police and security presence is growing as the clock ticks to 9 p.m. ET and politicians head to the Manhattan studio to defend their party's VP pick.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nUsha Vance is a 'spirit guide' to husband JD Vance and has evolved with him on Donald Trump\n\nJD Vance's criticisms of professional women – as childless cat ladies or “miserable” women who prioritize career over children – might suggest his own spouse would be a model traditional housewife.\n\nInstead, Usha Vance is a model high-achieving child of Indian immigrants.\n\nUsha Vance was one of the top students at Yale Law School (according to classmates) where she met her future husband, JD, now the junior senator from Ohio and Donald Trump's running mate. She held prestigious clerkships and worked as a corporate litigator for a white-shoe firm until July.\n\nBut Usha Vance is also a bit of an enigma to those who have followed her evolution from registered Democrat to reportedly believing Trump was responsible for inciting the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, to now potentially becoming the second lady.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nWho are the debate moderators?\n\n“CBS Evening News” managing editor and anchor Norah O’Donnell, and “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan will moderate Tuesday's debate.

Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Mr. President, you've always been a moral force for our nation and the world,\" Biden said in a video featuring excerpts from ex-presidents - most of them.\n\nNot appearing in the video: Donald Trump.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCan I watch the debate without cable?

He wrote in \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that observing the habits of rich and poor shoppers and seeing how people \"gamed the welfare system\" with food stamps first made him realize liberal policies \"weren't all they were cracked up to be.\"\n\nSteve Dillman, Vance's boss at the grocery store, said Vance was a quiet, nice, typical teenager. When asked how he thinks Vance will perform in tonight's debate, he told The Enquirer: \"I think he'll do well.\"\n\n\"He was a neighbor kid from a neighbor family,\" said Dillman, who knew Vance's grandparents. \"He was a good employee. He was honest. He was dependable. He was always in a good mood. He was, fortunately for me, someone I didn't have to babysit.\"\n\n– Victoria Moorwood\n\nB-I-N-G-O!

Formal work started this past week, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg playing Vance during mock sessions, according to a source familiar with their efforts.\n\nWalz took a walk through downtown Petoskey on Monday and toured several local stores with his wife and daughter as a short break from debate prep.\n\nHouse Republican Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has played Walz during mock sessions with Vance, according to ABC News.\n\n\"I've known Tim probably since he was first elected almost 20 years ago, and I worked with him directly for four years, I spent the last month just going back, all of his old stuff, to get his phrases down, his mannerisms, that sort of thing,\" Emmer said in an interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. \"My job was to be able to play Tim Walz so JD Vance knows what he's going to see.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi, Sam Woodward and Karly Graham\n\nTrump plans to blog the debate\n\nThe Vance-Walz debate will draw a ton of running commentary on social media, including from one particularly biased source: Trump.\n\n\"I will be doing a personal PLAY BY PLAY of the Debate,\" Trump said on his Truth Social account, though he made clear he's already decided the winner.\n\nTrump cast the contest as one between the \"Brilliant\" Vance and the \"Highly Inarticulate\" Walz.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat time will Vance and Walz debate?\n\nThe debate between the Ohio senator and Minnesota governor is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Oct. 1.

We have to counter Russia’s aggression, put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China, and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world,” Biden wrote Saturday in an op-ed for The Washington Post.\n\n“To do these things, we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them, and when I meet with Saudi leaders on Friday, my aim will be to strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that’s based on mutual interests and responsibilities, while also holding true to fundamental American values,” he added.\n\nThe President’s visit has drawn criticism given that US intelligence has deemed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for ordering the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As a candidate for President, Biden had pledged to make the kingdom a “pariah.”\n\nIn his op-ed, Biden also said he will be focused on a more integrated and stable Middle East, calling the region “essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on” while also noting how critical Middle East energy supplies are in light of sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“And a region that’s coming together through diplomacy and cooperation – rather than coming apart through conflict – is less likely to give rise to violent extremism that threatens our homeland or new wars that could place new burdens on U.S. military forces and their families,” Biden said.\n\nBiden tacitly criticized his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, for abandoning the Iran nuclear deal and said his administration will “continue to increase diplomatic and economic pressure until Iran is ready to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal, as I remain prepared to do.”\n\nThe President is also set to travel to Israel during the visit. He touted US security assistance for the country in his op-ed, while also noting, “Working with Congress, my administration restored approximately $500 million in support for Palestinians.”\n\nBiden is set to travel to the region on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Gregory Clary"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}]}

By contrast, someone who came into contact with a backyard chicken or wild bird might have inhaled the virus and therefore become sicker.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "COVID-19 in Iowa has killed more than 6,100; we remember those lost", "text": "The numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly. They appear in our inboxes and on our feeds like clockwork, sandwiched between big box store discounts and emails from friends.\n\n4,706 positive cases one day.\n\n40 deaths another.\n\nOver 400,000 recovered to date.\n\nMore than 6,100 lost.\n\nIn the routine of it all a callus grows, a protection against what these numbers actually stand for — people.\n\nBehind these figures are storytellers and hard workers, Cubs fans and pie bakers, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories. If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

But scientists and health officials have been concerned that CWD could jump to humans as mad cow disease did in the United Kingdom in the 1990s. In 2022, scientists in Canada published a study, based on mice research, suggesting a risk of CWD transmission to humans.\n\nHere's what you need to know about chronic wasting disease and whether you need to worry about it.\n\nResearchers identify troubling case involving 2 deaths\n\nResearchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio have reported how two hunters who ate venison from a deer population known to have CWD died in 2022 after developing sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a neurological disease like CWD.\n\nThe second man to die, who was 77, suffered \"rapid-onset confusion and aggression,\" the researchers said, and died within a month despite treatment.\n\n\"The patient’s history, including a similar case in his social group, suggests a possible novel animal-to-human transmission of CWD,\" they wrote in the case report, which was presented earlier this month at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology and published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology.\n\nThe researchers did not say where the men lived or hunted. But the highest concentration of CWD-infected deer can be found in Kansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Wyoming, according to CDC and US. Geological Survey reports.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in distinguishing between the diseases, the researchers said the case does not represent a proven case of transmission. However, \"this cluster emphasizes the need for further investigation into the potential risks of consuming CWD-infected deer and its implications for public health,\" they wrote.\n\n'Zombie deer disease':What to know about chronic wasting disease and its spread in the US.\n\nWhat is 'zombie deer disease'? What are prion diseases?\n\nAlso known as chronic wasting disease, \"zombie deer disease\" is a prion disease, a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects deer, elk, moose and other animals, the CDC says.\n\nIn prion diseases, the abnormal folding of certain \"prion proteins\" leads to brain damage and other symptoms, according to the CDC. Prion diseases, which usually progress rapidly and are always fatal, can affect humans and animals.\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD), which is a form of mad cow disease, are prion diseases found in people.\n\nMad cow disease is an example of a prion disease that can spread from cattle to humans, and some researchers have likened \"zombie deer disease\" to it.\n\nFor instance, with mad cow disease, it usually took four to six years from infection for cattle to show symptoms, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Deer may have an incubation period of up to two years before the onset of symptoms. So, the animals could have the disease but look normal until the onset of symptoms, such as weight loss, notes the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe development of vCJD in humans in the wake of mad cow disease – its official name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE – through eating meat from contaminated cattle has concerned scientists about the possible transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) to humans.\n\nCan 'zombie deer disease' be transmitted to humans?\n\nEven though there has been no known confirmed case of deer-to-human transmission of \"zombie deer disease,' concerns have risen since officials found CWD in a dead deer in Yellowstone National Park in November.\n\n\"As of yet, there has been no transmission from deer or elk to humans,\" Jennifer Mullinax, associate professor of wildlife ecology and management at the University of Maryland, told BBC. \"However, given the nature of prions, CDC and other agencies have supported all efforts to keep any prion disease out of the food chain.\"\n\nShould CWD transmit to humans, it could create a \"potential crisis\" similar to what mad cow disease caused, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told BBC.\n\n\"However, it’s important to note that BSE and CWD prions differ structurally, and we do not yet know whether the pathology and clinical presentation would be comparable if CWD transmission to humans were to occur,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, chronic wasting disease continues to spread to more states; the most recent is Indiana. The disease was detected this month in a male white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the state, which borders part of Michigan, where CWD had been detected earlier, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey updated its tracking of chronic wasting disease on Friday to include 33 states (adding Indiana), as well as four Canadian provinces and four other countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden and South Korea).\n\nContributing: Sara Chernikoff and Julia Gomez\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The prison system last week posted a “request for qualifications” from companies interested in building the facilities. The department wrote that it intends to gather qualified companies and then take proposals later this year. The department wrote that its goal is to break ground in mid-2020. The prisons would each house more than 3,000 male inmates. Gov. Kay Ivey in February announced a plan to build three new prisons. She said the state will first gather proposals from companies and then decide how to proceed. Ivey has presented new facilities as part of the solution to prisons beset with violence and overcrowding. Critics have said staffing levels are a more pressing concern.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Attorney General William Barr has declared a law enforcement emergency in Alaska, clearing the way for the Justice Department to award more than $10 million to combat crime in rural Alaskan communities. Friday’s announcement follows a trip Barr made in May to meet with Native leaders in the state, who described disproportionately high rates of violence and sexual assault in Native communities. It’s the first time Barr has personally declared a law enforcement emergency since he assumed his role in February. The Justice Department has previously declared similar emergencies after mass shootings and to combat spikes in violent crime. The funding would be available immediately and is meant to help hire additional village and tribal officers and to pay for equipment and training.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: There’s an influx of new animals this season at the Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center, a nonprofit rescue organization that rehabilitates the injured, displaced and orphaned. The center releases animals to the wild and gives shelter to those that can’t be released – and right now, it’s up to its ears in wildlife to care for, according to spokeswoman Kim Carr. Some of the animals cared for include bobcats, foxes, skunks, rabbits, black bear cubs, coyotes, bobcats, raccoons, javelinas and porcupines. Center director Lisa Searles says workers currently have at least 100 animals going through rehabilitation – double the amount they had this time last year. Carr said raccoons in particular are coming in such huge numbers that the center is building new enclosures just to accommodate them. One raccoon arrived covered in cement, according to the center’s Facebook page.\n\nArkansas\n\nDermott: A youth detention center has been closed as part of Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s plan to streamline and improve the state’s juvenile system. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Dermott Juvenile Treatment Center closed Thursday. A Youth Services Division spokeswoman says the last 10 inmates have been sent home or to other facilities. The most recent closure leaves just five state juvenile lockups in operation. Hutchinson says he wants the state to provide “better quality, individualized treatment” for juvenile offenders. The nonprofit Disability Rights Arkansas, which monitors the treatment of children in state lockups, says the closure represents progress, but more is needed. It wants Arkansas to use diversion tactics to keep youths out of detention and provide effective treatment for those who must be imprisoned.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRancho Mirage: The Betty Ford drug and alcohol treatment center has agreed to make sure its facilities are accessible to the disabled. The U.S. attorney’s office says the agreement was finalized Friday with the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The foundation agreed to remove barriers for easier access to patient rooms, bathrooms and other areas at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage. The center also will make sure new buildings are accessible. The center was investigated for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act that bars discrimination against the disabled. Federal authorities say the foundation cooperated with the investigation. The Betty Ford Center was co-founded in 1982 by former First Lady Betty Ford, who underwent treatment for alcohol and prescription drug abuse.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A bison herd in northern Colorado is growing much faster than expected. The herd at Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, north of Fort Collins, began three years ago as 10 genetically pure descendants of bison in Yellowstone National Park. The Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd now numbers 76 animals, including a dozen calves born just this year. The natural area doesn’t have enough room for more than 100 bison. Herd managers expect to reach that number soon. Colorado State University, the city of Fort Collins and Larimer County hope to raise enough genetically pure, disease-free bison to give or trade to American Indian tribes and conservation organizations. Herd managers recently sent two bison bulls to a zoo in Oakland, California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State agriculture officials say time is quickly running out to purchase a locally grown, sweet treat: cherries. Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt says Connecticut is fortunate to have farmers who grow the fruit in both sweet and tart varieties, but there is only a short window to purchase them. Available for just two to three weeks, cherries are expected to peak over the Fourth of July weekend. They are considered one of the more challenging fruits to grow in the state. South Glastonbury farmer Don Preli, who owns Belltown Hill Orchards, says despite some issues with pollination and wet weather, the cherry crop has “fared well” this season. Consumers can find local farms on the Connecticut Grown website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of Muslim students have returned to a public pool in the city a year after they were asked to leave because of their cotton garments. Darul-Amaanah Academy principal Tahsiyn Ismaa’eel says the place “felt like home again” when the group returned Thursday. The city earlier this year settled with the school and families for $50,000. It didn’t admit wrongdoing but agreed to revise regulations to “expressly accommodate clothing worn for religious reasons or financial hardship.” The school argued city staff discriminated against seven children because of their religion. The then-pool manager said policy prohibited cotton in the pool, but Mayor Mike Purczycki said no such restriction existed. After Purczycki apologized, the school said staffers closed the pool before students could go in.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Interior Department says a Fourth of July celebration featuring President Donald Trump will include a flight demonstration by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels. The “Salute to America” event will honor the nation’s five service branches with music, military demonstrations and a fireworks display, as well as a speech by Trump at the Lincoln Memorial. Participants include the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, U.S. Army Band, Armed Forces Chorus, U.S. Marine Corps Silent Drill Team and others. Democrats have voiced concern that Trump could alter the tone of what traditionally is a nonpartisan celebration of America’s founding by delivering an overtly political speech. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt says Trump will use the speech to honor the military.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: An almost 14-foot jawbone believed to be from a right whale is now in a museum after a boater spotted it on a barrier island off Florida’s Atlantic Coast. The Tampa Bay Times reports the bone was taken to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville in May. The jawbone was discovered near Jacksonville. Museum officials say it appears to be a left mandible, which is part of the jawbone. DNA tests are underway to determine if the bone is indeed from a right whale. There are only about 450 right whales left in the world. The museum currently has a right mandible from a right whale, which was found in 1907. Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Michelle Kerr says it was a “rare, unique discovery.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two dogs, part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s “beagle brigade,” sniffed out two giant African snails in the luggage of a passenger arriving at the airport from Nigeria. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the beagles, named Candie and Chipper, were alerted to the passenger’s checked bags at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Friday. A Customs agriculture specialist found the snails in a suitcase, along with prohibited fruits and vegetables. The snails were turned over to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; the food was destroyed. The USDA’s website says such snails are illegally imported for classroom exhibits, as pets or for food. They’re also described as “one of the most damaging” in the world because they consume at least 500 types of plants, reproduce quickly and can cause meningitis.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state will soon provide drivers the option to select “X” as their gender on licenses. Hawaii News Now reports Democratic Gov. David Ige on Wednesday signed the bill intended to reduce discrimination against transgender and gender-fluid people. The gender X option is for drivers who prefer not to identify as male or female. Hawaii will be the ninth state to offer the gender X option on driver’s licenses. Officials say the bill also protects residents from being forced to provide documentation such as a birth certificate or other means of proof when selecting gender X. Supporters say the measure is a major victory for the LGBTQ community.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says a salmon and steelhead recovery workgroup he formed should focus on achievable goals that can bolster the state’s struggling fish populations. Little on Friday also told the nearly two dozen panel members comprised of environmentalists, ranchers, recreationists, power companies and state officials at their first meeting that the workgroup will help define Idaho’s position for federal efforts to save salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. Billions of dollars have been spent in Idaho, Oregon and Washington to save 13 species of Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead protected under the Endangered Species Act. Four of those species are in Idaho. Little, a Republican, says he’s not convinced that breaching four dams on the Snake River in Washington will help the fish rebound, and he advised the group not to get bogged down on that topic.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A herd of fiberglass cows is returning to the city to mark the 20-year anniversary of a popular display of brightly painted faux bovines that inspired other cities to line their streets with their own statues of everything from lobsters to pigs. The Chicago Tribune reports that for the month of July, the city is commemorating the 1999 “Cows on Parade” exhibit with what it’s calling “Cows Come Home.” Some 20 cows will be on display. They include some of the original exhibit’s most popular cows, a colorful reminder of the original public art exhibit in which well over 300 fiberglass could be spotted downtown. The cows sported baseball caps, Hawaii shirts, sunglasses, ladybug wings and more.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All emergency dispatchers in the state will have a year to complete training in telephone CPR under a new law taking effect Monday. Indiana officials say at least 10% of the nearly 2,400 people working in 911 call centers around the state lack such training. Officials say it’s particularly vital in rural areas where emergency crews face longer trips to arrive. Statewide 911 Board official Ed Reuter says most staff members may know hands-on CPR, but what telephone CPR requires is different. City of Lawrence emergency dispatcher Michael Clark says dispatchers have a set of cards they can read from on such calls, but they often veer off script to calm callers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowans will be hard-pressed to find local sweet corn for their backyard barbecues in time for the Fourth of July holiday. Due to the cool, wet spring, harvests will be later, and ears will be smaller. But sweet corn farmers are confident that when things finally get rolling, the sweet corn will be plentiful. The recent spike in temperature will help things along quickly. “We’re not going to have sweet corn ready by July 4 weekend. Maybe the weekend after,” said Ron Deardorff of Deardorff Sweet Corn. “The weather has not been conducive.” Deardorff said once the corn is finally ready, there will be plenty to go around, as he and his crew were able to do later plantings between the rain showers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A dispute is escalating between top Republicans and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration over looser rules for people who receive food assistance. The state Department for Children and Families on Friday released an internal analysis defending the legality of a new policy that makes it easier for adults who are not working to keep receiving food assistance. DCF made the change in May. Republican leaders in the GOP-controlled Legislature contend that the policy violates a 2015 law setting stricter requirements for food and cash assistance. They have promised that a committee will review the issue later this year. GOP Attorney General Derek Schmidt sent DCF Secretary Laura Howard a letter last week saying the policy appeared to violate state law. Howard released the legal analysis in response.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: KentuckyWired has overcome its squirrel problem – at least for now. Construction on the first ring of the state’s troubled internet project is now complete, Gov. Matt Bevin and U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers announced at a joint news conference Friday. That section, initially expected in April but delayed by squirrel damage, circles a region that includes Louisville, Lexington and Northern Kentucky, Bevin said. Also complete is a branch of the network that bridges Lexington and Somerset in Eastern Kentucky, which Rogers represents. By stringing more than 3,000 miles of fiber-optic cable across the state, the project is designed to improve high-speed internet access in Kentucky. But the project, pushed through at the end of Gov. Steve Beshear’s administration, has been plagued by two years of delays.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: An invasive species of swamp eel has been found in the city, and a state biologist says it’s the first time this species has been found in the United States. Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries biologist Robert Bourgeois says the Asian swamp eels in Bayou St. John may have been released for food or from an aquarium. Bourgeois said in a news release Thursday that they eat the same things native fish and animals do, but their effect on native species is not known. He says other Asian swamp eel species have been found over the years in New Jersey, Hawaii, Georgia and Florida. The department is asking the public to help it learn how widespread these are by freezing and reporting any they find.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmentalists say the removal of a dam on the Kennebec River remains a pivotal moment in the state’s conservation movement 20 years later. The Natural Resources Council of Maine says supporters will gather in Augusta on Monday to celebrate the removal of the Edwards Dam. The group credits the dam removal with allowing fish to return to the river and improving habitat for birds such as bald eagles and ospreys. The Natural Resources Council of Maine says the removal of the dam was also the beginning of a movement toward river restoration around the country. It says 1,200 dams have been removed since. The former dam site is now a park that includes a boat launch. The anniversary event Monday will be held at the park.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Journalists honored the five Capital Gazette employees who were shot to death in their newsroom last year by unveiling a plaque Friday with the names of the dead in a garden next to five rose bushes. The plaque in the waterside park acknowledges Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters and Rebecca Smith as “our cherished colleagues.” “This community is very lucky,” said Rick Hutzell, the newspaper’s editor. “It has what a lot of communities have lost, and that is a newsroom. A newsroom is a room full of people who turn up every day to celebrate our successes, to point out what is wrong, and to ask what could be better. That is what journalism is about, so it is extremely fitting that this is where this garden is … it’s a place where people come for a quiet moment to think about things.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The 38th annual Boston Harborfest will kick off Tuesday with patriotic music and a ceremonial cake cutting. The opening ceremony for the multiday festival will be held at Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The festival that began in 1982 features hundreds of activities to celebrate American independence, honor Boston’s colonial roots and showcase the city’s harbor. Harborfest will also include historical reenactments, Freedom Trail tours, live entertainment and other activities. The festival runs through Sunday. Tuesday night is the Parade of Lights, when boaters show off festive lights on their vessels in Boston Harbor. The parade will be followed by fireworks.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Emmy and Tony award-winning actress Lily Tomlin will receive a lifetime achievement award at the 15th annual Traverse City Film Festival in northern Michigan. Oscar winner and festival founder Michael Moore is expected to present the honor to Tomlin on Aug. 3. The festival runs July 30 to Aug. 4 and will feature more than 200 films and events. Actress and political activist Jane Fonda was last year’s recipient. Tomlin and Fonda star in the comedy “Grace and Frankie,” which airs on Netflix. Tomlin was born in Detroit. Her film credits include “Nashville,” “9 to 5” and “The Incredible Shrinking Woman.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nByron: About 40 cattle were swept away from their pasture in southern Minnesota as heavy rainfall caused the Zumbro River to swell. Olmsted County Sheriff Kevin Torgerson says some of the cattle have been located, but it’s going to take some time for authorities to access them due to flooding. Some cattle were still unaccounted for as of noon Friday. Torgerson says the incident happened near Byron. Video posted online shows several cows being swiftly pushed downriver in the current. National Weather Service records show the Rochester International Airport saw about 5 inches of rain during a six-hour period early Friday. Dodge County, to the west, also saw overnight thunderstorms, contributing to flooding of the Zumbro River. Several roads in the area were covered with water Friday morning and were closed.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: It was built as a hideout for mobster Al Capone and was a hangout for Elvis in the 1950s as he became a star. Now Gulf Hills Hotel is in danger of losing that history and heritage. An investor who wants to buy the 92-year-old resort met last month with the residents of the community that adjoins the 10-acre property, the Sun-Herald reports. Walt Reinhaus shared his vision for a “luxury” RV park near the water to help make the resort profitable, along with restoring the hotel, installing gardens, reopening a restaurant, renewing the swimming pool and adding a fitness center. “There are a lot of good things in your proposal that we really like,” one resident said, but the sticking point was the RV park. Residents said they are most concerned about the traffic on narrow roads and their property values.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two years after a state park employee died from complications from the Bourbon virus, researchers are using a strain of the virus taken from her to try to figure out how to treat the tick-borne disease. Meramec State Park Assistant Superintendent Tamela Wilson died in June 2017 after being bitten by an infected tick near her home outside Sullivan. The Washington Missourian reports Dr. Jacco Boon of Washington University is using lab mice infected with the Bourbon virus to research a possible cure. He is working with Barnes-Jewish Hospital doctors who diagnosed and treated Wilson before her death. Because the disease is rare, researchers are using a strain of Bourbon virus taken from Wilson to create cultures and conduct the testing.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The U.S. Supreme Court will consider reviving a program in the state that gives tax credits to people who donate to private-school scholarships. The state’s highest court had struck down the program because it violated the Montana constitution’s ban on state aid to religious organizations. The justices said Friday that they will review the state court ruling, which Montana parents are challenging as a violation of their religious freedom under the U.S. Constitution. The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the program giving tax credits of up to $150 for donations to organizations that give scholarships to private-school students amounts to indirect aid to schools controlled by churches.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska Board of Regents has approved the creation of a new heart and vascular disease research center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The board voted Friday to approve the Center for Heart and Vascular Research, which will bring together scientists from colleges across the University of Nebraska, including medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy, engineering, arts and sciences, and the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In a news release, UNMC says cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and hospitalization in Nebraska, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths. The UNMC College of Medicine and extramural research grants have committed $8 million in startup funding for five years.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The SLS hotel on the Las Vegas Strip is going back to the Sahara name. The iconic hotel that dates to 1952 and over the years hosted the Rat Pack, the Jerry Lewis Telethon and the Beatles came full circle with a Thursday night announcement by new owner Alex Meruelo. SLS General Manager Paul Hobson tells the Las Vegas Sun the idea of changing the name back to Sahara was one of the first things Meruelo began considering when he acquired the property in April 2018. Hotel officials say the change is part of a $150 million renovation expected to take up to three years. The hotel-casino at the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip closed as the Sahara in 2011 and reopened as the SLS in 2014.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s environmental agency is proposing drinking water standards that would be among the nation’s strictest when it comes to certain industrial compounds. The Department of Environmental Services on Friday proposed standards for four compounds called per- and polyfluoroalykyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds, used in firefighting foam, nonstick cookware and other products, increasingly have turned up in public water supplies and private wells around the country. The federal government has a nonbinding health threshold of 70 parts per trillion for two forms of the contaminant. New Hampshire is proposing 12 parts per trillion for PFOA and 15 parts per trillion for PFOS. The New Hampshire proposal will be considered by a legislative rules committee this month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: A Jersey shore community has moved its weekly beach fireworks show to accommodate endangered birds nesting and hatching there. More than 150 pairs of American oystercatchers, least terns and black skimmers have successively laid eggs near Jenkinson’s Aquarium in Point Pleasant Beach. So officials have moved the weekly summer fireworks shows, which started Thursday, to an area south of where the birds are located. The nesting and hatching area has been roped off, and aquarium employees are monitoring the birds at least twice a day. Some birds have already nested and hatched, while others have just started to nest. Officials estimate the birds will be around for at least another six weeks. Aquarium officials say visitors are encouraged to observe the birds.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is launching a new effort to craft legislation that could legalize recreational marijuana sales next year. The first-year Democratic governor announced Friday her recruitment of health, legal and fiscal policy experts to serve in a new discussion group that provides recommendations on state legalization. Members of the group include Democratic and Republican legislators who sponsored unsuccessful legislation this year to authorize and tax recreational marijuana sales at state-run stores. That proposal passed a House vote but stalled in the state Senate. Albuquerque City Councilor Pat Davis is leading the cannabis legalization task force. Other participants represent a labor union, sheriff’s department, health care business, Native American tribe, medical cannabis business, county government association, commercial bank and hospital company.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Daughters of the American Revolution is having a milestone moment. On Sunday, the lineage-based group officially installed the first African American woman on its national governing board. Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly, from Queens, and others in the historically white organization have been encouraging women of color to research their family roots to see if they can find a tie to the country’s founding. That’s after a past that’s included Eleanor Roosevelt quitting the Daughters of the American Revolution after it refused to allow black singer Marian Anderson to perform at its Constitution Hall in 1939. Kelly joined in 2004 after discovering she was related to a white Virginian who donated supplies to war efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIndian Trail: An animal rescue group recently asked women not to throw out their old bras but instead to send the clasps to the agency to help turtles with broken shells, but the response was so overwhelming that it’s now suggesting people instead donate what they planned to spend for shipping. News outlets report Carolina Waterfowl Rescue was asking women through social media to remove the eye closures from the fasteners and mail them in. Rescue group worker Keenan Freitas says the eye closures basically help wire the turtle shell back together. The nonprofit has been seeing as many as 40 turtles a week during the past month. It says many of them have been run over by cars, lawnmowers and boats. An animal rehabilitation group in Iowa originally had the idea, saying it uses the fasteners along with small zip ties to help the turtles heal their broken shells.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The National Park Service says the fungus that causes a deadly disease in bats has been discovered in the state. The Bismarck Tribune reports the fungus was discovered after swab testing of a bat captured May 6 at Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site near Stanton. The fungus causes white-nose syndrome, which can lead to dehydration or other conditions that kill bats. Thirty-three states have confirmed the disease since it was found in 2006 in New York. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wildlife refuge specialist Catherine Hibbard says four states, including North Dakota, have discovered only the fungus. South Dakota identified the fungus and disease for the first time last year. Humans can transmit the fungus but aren’t affected by it. It is spread easily among bats.\n\nOhio\n\nWarren: A region of the state steeped in Italian culture is showing off its local cuisine with a new culinary passport. The Italian Food Trail is designed to draw tourists and residents to 15 participating restaurants, markets, pizza shops and wineries throughout Trumbull County, to appreciate the Italian food offerings. Some of the county’s most memorable dishes are rooted in the traditions of Italian families that began arriving in the area in the late 19th century. The Vindicator of Youngstown reports the free passport is available at the county tourism office, the food sites or through the trail’s website while supplies last. Participants purchasing an appetizer, entree or dessert at a participating site get their passport stamped. A completed booklet can be exchanged for 15 chances to win a $50 gift certificate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of working oil rigs in the state is down more than a quarter from this time last year, amid a nationwide decrease. Oil-field services firm Baker Hughes reported 102 rigs operating in the state Friday. The Journal Record reports this is down 27% from a year ago following a sharp drop in January and gradual decreases through June. The lower count comes as energy companies across the country have prioritized cash flow over increased production amid low oil prices. Houston-based Baker Hughes reports 967 oil and gas rigs operating nationally, 80 fewer than a year ago. The rig count is down even as the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that national refinery capacity rose more than 1% since the beginning of 2018 to hit a record high.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Undocumented immigrants will legally be able to obtain driver’s licenses under a measure sent to the governor’s desk. Senators voted 17-10 Saturday to expand driving privileges to all Oregon residents regardless of their immigration status. Gov. Kate Brown is expected to sign the bill into law. The move will make Oregon the 14th state to allow undocumented immigrants to drive. The bill has been a priority for pro-immigration groups who say that undocumented immigrants often live in rural areas, which requires having a car. Those without proof of residence say they live in fear that they could be deported over a traffic stop. Opponents say that the measure should be sent to the ballot considering that voters shot down a similar proposal in 2016.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Works by one of the world’s best known video artists are on display at the Barnes Foundation. “I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like: The Art of Bill Viola” opened Sunday and runs through Sept. 15. The Barnes’ first exhibition devoted to video art brings together a selection of Viola’s major pieces dating from 1976 to 2009, including the rarely seen large-scale installations “He Weeps for You,” created in 1976, and “Ascension,” from 2000. During the 1970s, Viola was a vanguard leader experimenting with the relatively new medium of video. His works are included in major museum collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and London’s Tate Modern.\n\nRhode Island\n\nLincoln: The most diverse class of troopers in state history has graduated from the Rhode Island State Police Training Academy. The class of 2019 graduated Friday in Lincoln. According to state police, seven women graduated – a record in the agency’s nearly century­long history. Of the 37 new troopers, 23 are white, eight are black, and six are Hispanic. Seven of them served in the military, and 10 troopers speak a second language. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says graduating such a diverse class ensures the department better reflects the communities it serves. The troopers were selected from about 1,500 applicants and began intensive paramilitary training in January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nKershaw: Potentially rich deposits of gold in the state are fueling a proposed expansion of a huge mine that has some excited about the prospect of 250 new jobs in a tiny community halfway between Columbia and Charlotte. OceanaGold’s expansion plan says the Australia-based company would increase its existing 4,552-acre Haile Gold Mine site by more than 900 acres near Kershaw. According to plans filed with the state, the company is seeking to dig an underground mine that would extend up to 1,314 feet below the surface. Haile is the largest open-pit gold mining operation in the eastern United States. The South Carolina mine cranked up about three years ago. The State reports the proposed project still needs approval from federal and state environmental regulators.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: An assessment of the conditions of the state’s highways and byways following spring storms has pegged damage at $7.5 million. South Dakota Department of Transportation engineer Tammy Williams told the state Transportation Commission on Thursday that damage to county roads has reached more than $6 million and $1.5 million to state highways. KELO-TV reports county governments haven’t yet figured out how much work is waiting from snow and ice in May. Crews are still waiting for the water to go down in many places. Williams says counties want special inspections of 261 bridges across South Dakota. Twelve bridges have been closed, and three have traffic confined to single lanes because officials don’t know how much weight the structures can bear.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University is pledging $2 million for the National Museum of African American Music, which is scheduled to open a 56,000-square-foot facility downtown early next year. The university says the gift includes in-kind contributions and direct financial support, and it will help expand the museum’s archives, contribute to innovative programming, support the completion of the facility and more. Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos says the partnership will help build global awareness of the impact of African American composers, performers and supporters. The partnership will include collaboration with the university’s Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries to offer their collection of books, scores, recordings and other materials for loan, display and study at the museum. Vanderbilt and the museum will also team up for a speaker series after the facility opens.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A recent collaboration involving the Texas A&M Forest Service and NASA scientists could help urban planners in the state more quickly coordinate recovery efforts following a natural disaster. The project, which also included the U.S. Forest Service and other groups, used satellite imagery and other remote sensing information to authenticate the number of urban trees killed by drought in 2011 and 2012. The study used aerial imagery and other models to measure urban canopies in two cities, Austin and Houston, from 2010 to 2018 to reveal both the effects of the drought and trends in recovery. Researchers confirmed earlier findings that 5.6 million urban trees were killed statewide. Those are in addition to the more than 300 million trees that died across the rest of Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s skin cancer rates have skyrocketed in recent years, and local health officials are urging the public to take preventative measures. Utah has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, with 41.2 new cases per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent data, compiled by the CDC in 2016, revealed that melanoma was the third most common type of cancer in Utah, trailing only breast cancer and prostate cancer. A recent study by QuoteWizard Insurance News claims residents in Southern states are typically more likely to protect themselves from sun damage – and therefore report lower rates – than residents states with colder climates.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is expanding a program that hopes to help tourists who enjoy visiting move to the Green Mountain State full time. It’s part of an effort to reverse the declining workforce and boost state revenue. Since the “Stay-to-Stay Weekends” were launched last year, more than a dozen people have moved to the state. The weekends include a reception hosted by a local chamber of commerce or young professional’s network, as well as opportunities to explore the region. The governor’s office says guests also meet with employers who are hiring, tour the area with a real estate agent, or visit an incubator or co-working space to meet with entrepreneurs. This year new communities offering the long weekends include Newport at the end of July and in December and St. Johnsbury in September and October.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hundreds of new state laws are going into effect Monday. One of the biggest items that passed during the legislative session earlier this year was a measure that ends the suspension of driver’s licenses of people with unpaid court debt. The Department of Motor Vehicles said it sent 500,000 letters to Virginia residents with suspended licenses advising them how to get their license back starting July 1. Other notable new laws going into effect include an increase in the age limit to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21, looser restrictions on happy hour advertising, and a $4 increase on mandatory car-safety inspections.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Department of Ecology says the amount of sewage overflow that forced a beach in the city to close is 10 times more than original estimates. KCPQ-TV reports officials said last week that 16,000 gallons had spilled into Puget Sound at Golden Gardens Park. Officials said Friday that additional samples now show about 165,000 gallons of sewage overflow. Seattle Public Utilities says the overflow was caused by a blockage of tree roots and materials such as wipes in the sewer system north of the park. Signs have been posted, and the public is advised to avoid contact with the water in the affected area until further notice. Heath officials say swimming in the contaminated water can cause gastroenteritis, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections and other illnesses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is eyeing a fall 2021 start date for new aviation programs. According to The Herald-Dispatch, Marshall’s board of governors voted Friday on an intent to plan two new degrees in aviation sciences to train commercial airplane and helicopter pilots. Marshall plans to partner with Southern Utah University and Yeager Airport to create its new School of Aviation. Southern Utah’s program is already accredited by the Federal Aviation Administration. The courses will be held at Marshall’s South Charleston campus, where a new residential hall is also planned. Yeager Airport will also host classes and will include a new hangar for Marshall’s aircraft, classrooms and a flight simulator. Marshall will initially buy two $500,000 planes and plans to purchase up to seven by 2023.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An expert on poverty says the state should raise its minimum wage and provide more help for families who are struggling despite record-low unemployment. University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Timothy Smeeding co-wrote a report that found Wisconsin’s poverty rate has remained stagnant for nearly a decade, fluctuating between 10% and 11% from 2008 to 2017. The federal government considers the poverty level for a family of four to be $25,750. The report’s methodology determined Wisconsin’s poverty threshold for a two-adult, two-child household to be $27,241 because of the state’s low cost of living. Smeeding says work alone isn’t enough to lift some families out of poverty. He suggests raising the minimum wage and boosting state support.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: For the first time in seven years, peregrine falcons at Devils Tower did not have a successful nesting season. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a pair of falcons showed behavior consistent with courtship, but the weather might have put a damper on breeding. Rene Ohms, chief of resource management for the National Park Service, says this year’s late-season snow, colder-than-normal temperatures and frequently heavy rain have made it “very difficult for them.” The species was listed as endangered in 1970 but had a remarkable recovery and was removed from the list in 1999. Falcons returned to Devils Tower in 2013 and successfully nested for the past six years. Ohms says nests sometimes fail, but the population as a whole won’t be affected.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/12/06/raw-milk-unsafe-bird-flu/76825655007/", "title": "Experts say raw milk 'one of the riskiest foods.' RFK wants it sold", "text": "Former presidential candidate and Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a big fan of raw, unpasteurized milk and has said he would work to remove restrictions on its sale.\n\nPublic health officials say drinking raw milk is a very bad idea. And on Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a new order to collect milk samples to test for H5N1 (bird flu) which has been circulating in U.S. dairy cattle since it was first detected in March. Over 700 dairy herds in the U.S. have tested positive for bird flu across 15 states, according to federal data.\n\nThat includes herds owned by Mark McAfee, a California raw milk producer whose products The Guardian reports have been recalled for bird fly contamination several times. On Thursday, media outlets reported that Kennedy, who is a McAfee customer, urged him to apply for a position advising the Trump administration's health departments to create a “raw milk ordinance.”\n\nTests on contaminated dairy showed that pasteurization killed the bird flu virus, officials said, making it safe to consume.\n\nStates across the country have started to take another look at prohibitions against selling unpasteurized milk after a surge of testimonials from fans of raw milk — most recently content creators on TikTok — who insist it's healthier and easier to digest, despite evidence that it can be dangerous to children, the elderly, or people who are pregnant or have a compromised immune system.\n\nLast year, Florida's former Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis tried some at a raw milk farm and pronounced it \"delicious.\"\n\nIn a tweet, the former state CFO said, \"Something’s wrong with the way the feds regulate foods and decide what’s 'healthy.' I visited a raw milk farm; tastes delicious! But they have to say on the carton it’s not for “human consumption” cause of some federal regulation?! Stupid!\"\n\nThe USDA testing program will move in stages, first testing milk at milk silo in dairy processing facilities nationwide to identify where the disease is present before moving on to identifying infected herds through bulk tank sampling.\n\nIs raw milk better for you? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is raw milk?\n\nRaw milk is simply milk from cows, sheep and goats (or any other animal) that has not been heated to a sufficiently high temperature to kill harmful bacteria, a process called pasteurization that has been used for over 100 years,\n\nThe process of heating up wine to deactivate any harmful microorganisms in it and make it last longer has been known for over a thousand years, and multiple scientists found that thermal treatment aided in food preservation. In the 1860s, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur discovered that less aggressive, briefer, less hot temperatures would work just as well, and the process was called \"pasteurization\" in his honor.\n\nRoutine pasteurization of milk started in the 1920s and became widespread in the 1950s, leading to \"dramatic reductions\" in the number of people getting sick, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\n\nIs it safe to drink raw milk?\n\n\"In fact, raw milk is one of the riskiest foods,\" according to the CDC. \"Raw milk can be contaminated with harmful germs that can make you very sick.\"\n\nTurns out milk is an excellent medium if you're looking for bacteria. Raw milk and products made from raw milk, including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, can be contaminated with germs from the animals, their waste or their environment such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria which can cause serious illness, hospitalization, or death.\n\nAccording to the CDC, improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source.\n\nWhat can raw milk do to you?\n\nFor many, drinking raw milk will have no adverse effects. But even people who have drunk plenty of it before can get sick from drinking raw milk or products made with raw milk and experience many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Some people may develop chronic, severe or life-threatening diseases, including:\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis.\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, and even death.\n\nBovine tuberculosis, which can cause infections in the chest, lungs, kidney, spine and brain.\n\nIllnesses caused by bacteria from raw milk \"can be especially problematic for infants, young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised,\" according to the FDA. Between 1987 to September 2010, the FDA found at least 133 reported outbreaks from the consumption of raw milk and raw milk products, leading to 2,659 cases of illnesses, 269 hospitalizations, 3 deaths, 6 stillbirths and 2 miscarriages.\n\nIn 2014, two people were infected with listeriosis from raw milk distributed by a Pennsylvania dairy, one from California and one from Florida. The Florida victim died, the CDC said.\n\nRaw milk nutrition facts: Is raw milk good for you?\n\nRaw milk fans say it is.\n\n\"Pasteurization destroys enzymes, denatures anti-microbial and immune-stimulating components, diminishes nutrient availability, denatures fragile milk proteins, destroys vitamins C, B6 and B12, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth and behavior problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis and heart disease,\" according to A Campaign for Real Milk.\n\nRaw milk tastes better, advocates say, and claim it contains more butterfat, no additives and it's easier to digest. And while the need for pasteurization was great in the 20th century when tuberculosis, scarlet fever and other diseases were widespread, they say that modern farming eliminates that risk.\n\nHowever, according to the FDA, multiple studies have shown that pasteurization has no significant effect on the nutritional quality of milk and raw milk contains no additional benefits but many additional risks.\n\nThere is a tendency to believe that foods that have not been processed or come from small, local farms are inherently healthier, but some processing is necessary to destroy disease-causing germs, the CDC said.\n\nMilk can get germs from an animal's poop, skin or udder, from the environment where the animal lives, from insects or rodents, from unsanitary conditions, or even from cross-contamination from dairy workers, and any of that can happen no matter how small the farm or how clean the conditions are.\n\nPasteurization is recommended by the CDC, the FDA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, and others.\n\nDoes pasteurized milk cause lactose intolerance?\n\n\"Lactose is a unique disaccharide found in milk,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a raw milk factsheet. \"Lactose concentration in bovine milk is about 4.8%. People with lactose intolerance lack the enzyme, beta-galactosidase or lactase, to break down lactose into glucose and galactose during digestion. All milk, raw or pasteurized, contains lactose and can cause lactose intolerance in sensitive individuals.\"\n\nRaw milk also does not cure asthma or allergies, prevent osteoporosis, improve children's immune systems or increase gastrointestinal health any more than pasteurized milk does, the FDA said.\n\nIs raw milk legal in Florida?\n\nIt is not illegal to drink raw milk in Florida or any other state in the U.S., but it is illegal here for anyone to sell anything besides Grade A pasteurized milk and milk products for human consumption, according to Florida Statute 502.091(1).\n\nCheese made from raw milk may be sold retail to the final customer or food service establishments but only if the cheese is aged more than 60 days at a temperature above 35 degrees. Raw milk may be sold as pet food from farms, markets and health stores provided it is labeled \"not for human consumption.\"\n\nIt's not a federal regulation to prohibit or label raw milk. Federal regulations only prohibit selling or distributing raw milk and raw milk products across state lines.\n\nWhat is the healthiest milk to drink?Best options for protein content and weight loss.\n\nAre there states where it's legal to sell raw milk for humans?\n\nSelling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in 20 states, including Florida.\n\nSome states — not Florida —allow \"cowshare\" or \"herdshare\" agreements where consumers can purchase a \"share\" of a cow and are therefore partial owners and can consume its milk. Others outlaw raw milk sales but allow it directly from the farms or dairies where it is produced, with restrictions. Some states allow it with permits or licenses. According to Britannica ProCon.org, these are the current restrictions on raw milk across the country.\n\nFederal law prohibits non-pasteurized milk in its final package form from being distributed across state lines.\n\nEduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY, contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/10/gray-whale-tows-calf-wolves-move-john-dillinger-exhumed-news-around-states/40968857/", "title": "50 States roundup", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley’s suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year’s total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn’t get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail’s general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it’s considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff’s office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf’s Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. “You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole,” he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year’s ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn’t “portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth’s circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son’s arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. “Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery,” Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she’s hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. “I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away,” she said. “I feel like they just sent them down for me.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii’s homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii’s official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.\n\nIdaho\n\nKellogg: Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released. Silver Mountain Resort is located about 60 miles east of Spokane, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Idaho Panhandle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: O’Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they’re called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports’ Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren’t targeting travelers with cannabis, and it’s not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they’re not breaking federal law and won’t run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson’s behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It’s unknown what Thompson’s plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger’s body, citing a duty to “ensure the safety and integrity” of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago’s Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the “common myth” that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims “have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:It will cost more to attend the Iowa State Fair this year. Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair’s marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is “eating food as fast as it’s put in front of him.” He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as “very sweet and loving.” The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. “Trump broke the law,” according to the billboard, which includes McConnell’s face. “Senator McConnell, don’t help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove.” The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell’s office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state’s school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana’s education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state’s business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn’t discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine’s lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It’s possible for the state’s lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have “spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area,” according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the “short period” of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven’t decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal’s care team chooses a name and other times there’s a contest that involves the public, she added.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College’s director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, “In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence?” In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, “I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our ‘cultural sites’ with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state’s dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state’s constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that’s needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an “adequate” education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a “quality” education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature’s approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they’ll face opposition from the state’s powerful teachers’ union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.\n\nMississippi\n\nHancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed “core stage” of NASA’s Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA’s Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn’t expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year’s near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps’ Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn’t release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff’s office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff’s office.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. “The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues,” Gerhard said. “There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction.” The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal’s office were notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state’s largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton’s publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility’s website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That’s a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The head of New Mexico’s largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He’s urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Nearly 300 of the city’s new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company’s investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state’s open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system’s flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the “Silent Sam” statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer’s wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The future of the city’s only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn’t have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn’t have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic’s variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that “we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code “overlay” is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company’s responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an “excellent balance” between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMacungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant’s payroll. “We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand,” said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they’re working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution’s separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers “unchecked control” over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they’re filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it “blatant overreach by the executive branch.” The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn’t cover all the districts in the state. McMaster’s $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina’s largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor’s proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim’s family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. “We have a lot more questions than answers,” Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported\n\nTennessee\n\nSpring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM’s Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle’s first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a “mix” of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state’s roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was “unexplainable.” Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. “We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That’s 47 families that don’t have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it’s still high. We’re averaging just way too many each month,” she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person’s death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city’s Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn’t have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were “understandably scared,” but are otherwise in good health and didn’t show signs of neglect. They’re being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn’t say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a “Green New Deal” executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city’s new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That’s because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city’s longer-term electrification plans, Durkan’s office said. There’s no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state’s U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTown: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. “I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip,” Mecher said. “I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan.” Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father’s house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors. Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren’t native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/28/lebron-mural-vandalized-seaweed-eating-cows-flash-floods-news-around-states/117686040/", "title": "LeBron mural vandalized, seaweed-eating cows, flash floods: News ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: Charlotte Morris , the interim president of Tuskegee University, will assume the job on a permanent basis, the school said. Trustees of the historically Black school in east Alabama elected Morris to the position, which takes effect Sunday, officials said in a statement. Morris’ time as interim president began with the departure of Lily McNair, who began in 2018 and and left earlier this year. With more than 30 years at the school, Morris’ previous roles at Tuskegee included chief of staff and secretary to the board. Her inauguration as the school’s ninth president is planned for April to coincide with Founder’s Day. “She understands the needs of this university today – putting the students first – and is the right leader for tomorrow and beyond,” board chair Norma Clayton said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A small airplane reported overdue Monday was found crashed, with the two people on board dead, according to Alaska State Troopers. Austin McDaniel, a troopers spokesperson, said there were two adults on board. He said the plane left from Anchorage, but he did not have immediate details on the purpose of the flight or when it took off. He said by email that the wreckage was found in Chugach State Park. The troopers, in an online log, said authorities were notified about 8 p.m. Monday of an overdue aircraft that had taken off from an Anchorage airport. The statement said the aircraft was believed to have gone up the Knik River Valley toward Knik Glacier and Lake George before heading toward Chugach State Park. A good Samaritan found the wreckage about 10:45 p.m. Monday and was able to land nearby. Recovery efforts were expected to start Tuesday, the troopers’ statement said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A dust cloud that triggered a dust advisory in Maricopa, Casa Grande and Florence on Tuesday night moved north along Interstate 10 to hit the southern edge of Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix issued a dust advisory affecting parts of Maricopa County, including the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert and Queen Creek until 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. Visibility was below 1 mile in some areas, including parts of I-10, Interstate 8, highway 347, and Highway 85 south of Gila Bend, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Just before 7:30 p.m., the weather service said the dust cloud was blowing into the Phoenix area and would cause visibility to drop to 1 to 3 miles, “enough to notice but not low enough to cause significant concerns.” At 7:45 p.m., the weather service said isolated storms across central Arizona would wind down in the next hour or two although dust clouds, heavy rain and gusty winds were possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The leader of the University of Arkansas system proposed keeping a statue of the late U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus but add “contextualization” about his legacy, despite calls to remove the monument because of Fulbright’s support of segregation. System President Donald Bobbitt cited a new state law preventing the removal of historical monuments without state approval in his proposal, which was scheduled to go before the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday. Bobbitt’s proposal also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’ college of arts and sciences. The proposal called for adding “a contextualization to the statue that affirms the university’s commitment to racial equality and acknowledges Senator Fulbright’s complex legacy, including his record on international affairs, civil rights legislation, and racial integration.” Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known worldwide for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The San Francisco school board violated state law when it voted to cover up a 1930s mural that critics said is racist and degrading in its depiction of Black and Native American people, a judge ruled Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo said the board failed to conduct an environmental impact review before it voted in 2019 to cover up the sprawling mural at George Washington High School that depicts the life of George Washington, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The 1936 mural was painted by Victor Arnautoff, one of the foremost muralists in the San Francisco area during the Depression. In addition to depicting Washington as a soldier, surveyor and statesman, the 13-panel, 1,600-square-foot mural contains images of white pioneers standing over the body of a Native American and slaves working at Washington’s Mount Vernon estate in Virginia. New Deal scholars have argued that Arnautoff, a Russian-born communist and social critic, critically depicts unsavory aspects of American history in his work. But as early as the 1960s, some students at George Washington High School have argued that the mural’s imagery is offensive and racist. District officials told the Chronicle that they were reviewing the decision. Members can’t take any further action until at least September.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A U.S. appeals court has ruled against a web designer who didn’t want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples and sued to challenge Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver denied Lorie Smith’s attempt to overturn a lower court ruling throwing out her legal challenge. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith, argued that the law forced her to violate her Christian beliefs. In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said Colorado had a compelling interest in protecting the “dignity interests” of members of marginalized groups through its law. The anti-discrimination law is the same one at issue in the case of Colorado baker Jack Phillips that was decided in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court decided the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people. The Alliance Defending Freedom said it would appeal the ruling. “The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is embarking on a plan to dedicate Medicaid funds to help address the problem of gun violence and other violent crimes. Under new legislation, financially challenged community-based violence prevention services will be able to receive state and federal Medicaid funds. These programs, which are growing across the U.S., typically involve intervention at the hospital after someone has been shot and intensive case management in the months following the injury to try and break the cycle of violence .Connecticut’s new law requires the state Department of Social Services commissioner by July 1, 2022, to amend the state’s Medicaid plan so it will cover the cost of community violence prevention services for beneficiaries who have received medical treatment for an injury “sustained from an act of community violence,” such as a shooting, and have been referred for services by a licensed health care or social services provider.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro:The Mountaire Farms chicken processing plant has been issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control after a contractor digging a ditch for a new pipeline damaged an existing one, causing treated wastewater to spill into Swan Creek. Ironically, the digging was taking place as part of construction of the poultry plant’s new wastewater treatment system, according to the notice. When the pipe broke, the treated effluent filled up the excavated area and ultimately made its way into the new, unfinished pipeline that discharges into Swan Creek. The incident occurred April 24 and Mountaire reported it to DNREC that day, the notice said. An estimated 15,000 gallons of effluent flowed into Swan Creek for about 10 minutes before the source was shut off. DNREC issued the notice of violation to Mountaire on June 15, charging them with unauthorized discharge to surface water. The only action required of Mountaire is that it provide DNREC with documentation of repairs. No fines were levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents of the 600 block of Irving Street Northwest said D.C.’s urban foresters missed obvious signs that an aging oak tree on the street was ready to topple, WUSA-TV reported. “It was a ticking time bomb,” said Tommy Duren, whose home was badly damaged when the tree came down during storms Monday night. “I don’t know how an arborist gets this wrong.” Two other homes were damaged in the incident. Duren said pruning crews and inspectors should have known the tree was a threat. A spokesman for D.C.’s Department of Transportation, which oversees the Urban Forestry Division, said the last time the tree had been pruned by a city crew was in January. The spokesman described the situation as “force majeure”, a legal term meaning an unforeseeable circumstance. The Urban Forestry Division is responsible for more than 175,000 public trees in the district, according to the agency’s website, which reported the city removed nearly 2,700 trees in the last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Gov. Ron DeSantis held a private meeting Monday with doctors to oppose mask mandates in public schools. DeSantis said he fears that the federal government might try to force mask mandates in schools, saying children would suffer. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status. “Our view is that this should absolutely not be imposed. It should not be mandated. And I know our Legislature feels strongly about it,” said DeSantis. He predicted lawmakers would hold a special session “to be able to provide protections for parents and kids who just want to breathe freely and don’t want to be suffering under these masks during the school year.” DeSantis didn’t invite media to the discussion, but his office provided a video and transcript of the meeting in the state Capitol. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new coronavirus infections last week, more than any other state, according to the CDC. But DeSantis has been firmly opposed to lockdown restrictions, mask mandates and vaccine passports, signing a bill into law that prevents businesses to ask for proof of vaccination and local governments from imposing COVID restrictions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Delta Air Lines is loosening restrictions on basic economy tickets to reduce the deluge of frustrated travelers facing hourslong waits on customer service phone lines. Basic economy tickets usually do not allow any changes to the itinerary, even for a change fee. The airline temporarily allowed more flexibility during the pandemic, but that policy ended earlier this year. Starting Wednesday, however, Delta will temporarily allow changes to basic economy tickets for travel through Dec. 31, 2021, “to help address call wait times as we increase staffing,” CEO Ed Bastian wrote in an update to customers. The changes can be made online without paying a change fee. Delta cut about 18,000 of its 90,000 employees last year through buyouts and early retirements to cut costs amid the pandemic, leaving it short-staffed when travelers rapidly returned to the skies. “The unexpected pace of the return of our customers has resulted in some unforeseen challenges as we ramp up to meet demand and handle a record-breaking level of calls,” Bastian told customers Tuesday. He acknowledged that “the last thing you want is to experience long hold times when you call reservations or receive a notification that your flight schedule has changed.” To alleviate the problem, the Atlanta-based airline also is hiring more than 5,000 people, including 1,300 reservations specialists who will be trained by September and 3,000 in airport customer service and other areas. Delta has hired more than 2,200 people in Georgia this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s Department of Health has updated its guidance to schools a week before the start of another school year during the pandemic. The department’s guidance includes recommendations for wearing masks in all indoor settings and maintaining at least 3 feet of physical distance between students in classrooms, when possible. Masks are recommended outdoors when there’s crowding or prolonged close contact, said acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble. The department said schools should consider screening testing for all teachers and staff who have not been fully vaccinated regardless of the level of community transmission. The guidance also includes screening testing for those who are not fully vaccinated to facilitate participation in sports and other activities with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Promoting vaccines against COVID-19 for all eligible children and adults is the top strategy for safe in-person learning, Kemble said. Hawaii’s public school students return to classes Aug. 3.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: About 89% of Idaho residents live in communities where officials said masks should be worn again. The Post Register reported Wednesday that 27 of Idaho’s 44 counties have substantial to high transmission of COVID-19. Central District Health also said it supports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated recommendation for masks. Central District Health oversees Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties. The city of Boise on Wednesday started requiring masks indoors at its city-owned facilities. In a statement, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said they were concerned about rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Idaho has the sixth-lowest vaccination rate, with only about 46% of all eligible residents being fully vaccinated, compared to 56% of all eligible Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Michigan-based cannabis company on Tuesday ended its challenge of Illinois’ plan to authorize new marijuana business. Sozo Illinois Inc.’s decision to drop its lawsuit will allow Illinois to proceed with awarding licenses to operate marijuana dispensaries. The state on Thursday is to hold the first of three lotteries to award 55 licenses to applicants that scored 85% or better on their applications for recreational cannabis stores. The licenses have been delayed for more than a year, initially because of COVID-19-related issues. Problems with scoring the applications added to the delay. Sozo Illinois Inc. claimed Illinois law unfairly lowered its chances of getting a license. The lawsuit noted part of the law gives bonus points in scoring applications from Illinois-based companies, and another removed a bonus for hiring 10 people from areas hurt by the war on drugs. The lawsuit sought a court order to stop the lotteries. The Chicago Tribune reported Gov. J.B. Pritzker spokeswoman Charity Greene responded to Sozo Illinois’ actions with a statement saying it has a priority of his administration to establish a legal cannabis industry in Illinois that is equitable and reflects the diversity of the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:Elementary students in South Bend will be required to wear masks when the school year begins next month under the district’s new coronavirus response plan. The plan approved Monday night by the South Bend Community School Corp. board outlines the coronavirus measures that will be in place when the school year begins for students Aug. 11. Students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade will be required to wear masks indoors, but face coverings will not be required but strongly encouraged among unvaccinated staff and middle and high school students, the South Bend Tribune reported. Staff and middle- and high-school students who are vaccinated can go mask-free, but all visitors to any district school building will be required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status. Administrators said their decision comes in consultation with health officials and follows similar moves in large school districts, such as Indianapolis Public Schools and Wayne Township, in Indianapolis’ west suburbs. Unlike Indianapolis, which will collect voluntary proof of vaccination for those opting not to wear masks, South Bend’s policy will largely be based on an honor system.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected new federal government recommendations about wearing masks to help slow the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant in the U.S.. Reynolds signed a law in May that prohibits local officials from requiring masks to be worn in schools or businesses. Iowa ranks 21st in the nation when it comes to vaccinations, with 49.4% of the population, or 1.56 million people, fully vaccinated. Like many states, vaccination interest has stagnated in recent weeks. Iowa’s seven-day moving average of daily cases was 241 on Monday, the highest level since May 14.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A central Kansas school district is requiring masks in its buildings, and public health officials in one of the state’s most populous counties are recommending that nearly every resident wear masks in indoor public spaces. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature ended Kansas’ state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic in mid-June, citing a decline in new cases. The Salina district’s board of education voted 5-2 during a special Tuesday night meeting to impose its mask requirement, the Salina Journal reported. The district, which has about 6,900 students, appears to be the first outside the Kansas City area to impose a new mask mandate. It joined the Kansas City, Kansas, district and the neighboring Shawnee Mission district in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, to require at least some students to wear masks. Meanwhile, the Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health department on Tuesday began recommending that anyone age 2 or older wear masks in schools and other indoor spaces, even though the county has among the highest vaccination rates and the lowest total number of COVID-19 cases per capita among the state’s 105 counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nGeorgetown: A public workshop is planned to discuss options for an aging dam on the north fork of Elkhorn Creek, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said. The agency said it will lead a discussion on Aug. 3 about the Great Crossing Dam near Georgetown. A study commissioned by Scott County officials found the low-head dam needs repair but isn’t in danger of immediate failure. Fish and Wildlife said it is considering options that include removing the structure from the waterway, which would improve safety for boaters and swimmers and also improve water quality. The meeting will be held at Great Crossing High School in Georgetown. Those attending will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to department officials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As COID-19 vaccine interest plummeted in Louisiana, the state saw a spike in the number of wasted shots, with more than 79,000 doses trashed largely because health providers couldn’t find enough arms quickly enough. Wasted doses of the vaccines numbered fewer than 1,500 only four months ago. But data provided to the Associated Press by the Louisiana Department of Health showed the unused, discarded shots surged to more than 50 times that number by July 23. Meanwhile, another 161,000 doses of the three COVID-19 vaccines available across the state are scheduled to expire within 14 days – a waste the Health Department hopes to avoid either through a possible federal decision to extend the expiration dates or through increased vaccine interest. Waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, and the doses trashed in Louisiana so far represent less than 1% of the nearly 3.5 million vaccines that reached arms. Louisiana already is only drawing down a sliver of the vaccine doses made available by the federal government each week, despite an all-out push to get people interested in the shots that includes offering $2.3 million in cash prizes and scholarships.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Boothbay: A Maine marine science lab has received $5 million to further research into whether seaweed-based food can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cows. Bigelow Laboratory has been working in recent years on whether the feed supplements can help cut emissions of methane at cattle operations. Methane emissions, which happen when cows belch, allegedly contribute to climate change. The laboratory said the grant is from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and it will build on a project that began in 2019. Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory and the project leader, said the funding will help scientists apply their work in a way that is feasible on a global scale. The lab said it has had success in feed trials with individual herds. One of the biggest questions is how the supplement can be produced in large enough quantities and at a reasonable enough cost to make a dent in worldwide farming operations. Price said new parts of the project will “complement our existing search for the right seaweed solution and enable us to look into some creative ways that we can use what we’re learning to actually solve this global problem.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:The Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating three incidents of houses being set on fire on Nokomis Avenue in Salisbury. The first broke out on July 21. A social media post from the Salisbury Fire Department showed crews responded to the blaze just before 6 a.m. and were able to extinguish the fire and clear the scene before 7:30 a.m. Two other fires were reported simultaneously on July 23, just before 10 p.m., according to a news release from the fire marshal’s office. The homes are owned by Milford Twilley Rentals, the fire marshal’s office said, and were left with moderate fire, heat and smoke damage. There were no injuries, but the fire marshal’s office estimated the blazes totaled about $110,000 in damages. Smoke alarms were present for two of the fires but did not activate because the fires were set outside at the back of the homes. The fire marshal’s office said neighbors noticed all three blazes and reported them to the fire department. No arrests have been made. Deputy state fire marshals are asking anyone with information to call (410) 713-3780. Callers can remain anonymous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An Army officer from Massachusetts who was reported missing in action during the Korean War has been accounted for and is coming home for burial, military officials said. The remains of 1st Lt. Thomas J. Redgate, are scheduled to buried at the veterans’ cemetery in Bourne on Sept. 17, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a statement. Redgate, a member of Battery A, 48th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division, was reported missing Dec. 11, 1950, when his unit was attacked during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, according to the Army. The exact details surrounding his loss were not known, and his remains could not be recovered at the time. He was 24. In July 2018, following a summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea turned over 55 boxes that purportedly contained the remains of American service members killed during the war. The remains were examined at the DPAA’s laboratory in Hawaii, and based on anthropological analysis, as well as DNA and circumstantial evidence, one set was determined to be Redgate’s. Redgate, whose hometown was listed as Boston’s Brighton neighborhood, was accounted for in April 2020, but the announcement was made Wednesday because his family only recently received a full briefing of his identification, the Army said. Redgate’s name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarysville:City leaders have enacted a new law banning chickens, pheasants, badgers, kangaroos, coyotes and even cougars and tigers, the Times Herald of Port Huron reported. The new domestic animals and fowl ordinance that goes into effect in mid-August was crafted after some residents complained about neighbors who owned chickens and crowing roosters, according to Marysville City Manager Randy Fernandez. Marysville’s current ordinance bans “animals or domestic fowl within the city except dogs, cats, birds, fowl, or animals commonly classified as pets,” the newspaper reported. “So, what this basically does is tighten the limit on … no more chickens and some other animals that we would consider livestock, that do not belong in the limits of Marysville or any other city,” Fernandez told city council members Monday. Marysville has about 9,600 residents and is located along the St. Clair River, which separates that part of Michigan from Canada. The new ordinance allows Fernandez to deal with addressing future animal complaints “case-by-case if that’s the way that administration wants to,” City Attorney Al Francis said. However, the inclusion of animals such as chinchillas, doves and ferrets on the banned list might have been a little too much, according to Councilman Dave Barber, who said he knows people who keep such animals. “I get the rest of it, and I feel for the folks who have chickens,” Barber said. “But I question those three.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials said they are investigating a COVID-19 outbreak at a camp for teenagers in the northwestern part of the state. Communications specialist Erin McHenry said state health officials are investigating “a cluster of cases” at the Castaway Club Young Life Camp on Pelican Lake, about 45 miles east of Fargo, North Dakota. The facility typically hosts teenagers from about 10 states, camp manager Greg Johnson said. Johnson said he’s aware of 10 virus cases involving staff members over the past two weeks, with no new infections in the last week. The number of infected guests wasn’t immediately known because cases might have been reported in other states, KVRR-TV reported. Johnson said when the outbreak began, special protocols were put into place that included an indoor mask mandate and in some circumstances an outdoor mask requirement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves does not plan to issue a mask mandate for schools, even as COVID-19 cases are proliferating in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. “Governor Reeves has no intention of requiring students and staff to wear masks when they’re in school this fall,” his spokeswoman, Bailey Martin, said Tuesday. A few Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others are starting by mid-August. Some parents have raised concerns about the virus spreading among children too young to be vaccinated, and many school districts have said they will not require students or employees to wear masks because the governor has not set a mask mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Garth Brooks fans will have a chance to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when the country music star performs at Arrowhead Stadium on Aug. 7. Chiefs president Mark Donovan said the team plans to take every opportunity to offer vaccinations at Arrowhead, The Kansas City Star reported. Donovan said the organization isn’t sure if it will be able to use Arrowhead Stadium as a vaccination site on Chiefs game days this fall but “we’re trying to work through that as well.” A vaccination clinic was held at Arrowhead Stadium in the spring.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Health officials have issued a safety advisory for a lake just outside Yellowstone National Park after harmful algal blooms toxic to humans and animals were detected. The bloom of algae was in Hebgen Lake, a reservoir in southwestern Montana near the borders of Idaho and Wyoming, officials said. NorthWestern Energy monitors six locations across the reservoir weekly, said company spokesperson Jo Dee Black. Warmer water temperatures and a lower-than-usual water level is causing more algae growth earlier in the season than in a typical year, Black told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Blue-green algae is native to Montana’s freshwater lakes and reservoirs and not all varieties are harmful. But some algal blooms produce toxins that pose a risk to people, pets and livestock when ingested or through prolonged contact, according to NorthWestern Energy and the Gallatin City-County Health Department. Don’t drink, swallow or swim in water that has harmful blooms, officials said. The blooms can look like pea soup, grass clippings or green latex paint and are typically suspended in the water and can appear as floating mats.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have arrested a man accused of attacking and shooting another man in the neck with a BB gun for wearing a mask. The incident happened Tuesday in the vestibule of a midtown grocery store as one man was leaving and another was entering, the Omaha World-Herald reported. One man was not wearing a mask, police said, and ran up to and spit on the other man, who was wearing a mask. A fight ensued, and police said the unmasked man pulled out a BB-gun replica of a pistol and shot the other man. The injured man told officers that when he demanded to know why he was attacked, the unmasked man responded, “You’re on the other team.” The victim suffered injuries to his face, neck and shoulder and had to pull a pellet out of his shoulder, he said. Officers arrested the accused shooter on suspicion of felony terroristic threats and misdemeanor assault.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada print news organization and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to ensure access to what could be the state’s first execution in 15 years. A federal lawsuit invoking First Amendment rights seeks a court order banning state prisons chief Charles Daniels from preventing witnesses, including reporters, from observing the lethal injection of convicted killer Zane Michael Floyd. State and federal judges have put off Floyd’s execution until at least late October to allow time for appeals to be heard. Aides to Gov. Steve Sisolak and state Attorney General Aaron Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by ACLU attorneys Friday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Ford’s office represents state officials in several court challenges of the execution plan. The lawsuit said witnesses should have “uninterrupted viewing” of the condemned man from the time he enters the execution chamber until he is declared dead, with an unfettered ability to hear and see the process. It points to an execution manual released in June, allowing the prisons chief to choose the number and names of media representatives. Floyd, who was a Marine, received the death penalty in 2000 for killing four people and wounding a fifth with a shotgun at a Las Vegas supermarket in 1999. He also was convicted of repeatedly raping a woman the night before the rampage. The last person executed in Nevada was Daryl Mack, who asked to die in 2006 following his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu said New Hampshire will not be issuing new mask guidance following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where COVID-19 transmission is substantial or high. Four of New Hampshire’s 10 counties and the city of Nashua are experiencing moderate transmission, and the rest of the state is seeing minimal transmission, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. “At this point, it isn’t about the government providing that bubble of safety around individuals,” Sununu told WMUR-TV. Instead, he said it’s about the individual taking on personal responsibility. “It is your choice,” Sununu said. “We have all the power to protect ourselves and the community, and that’s getting the vaccine. It’s safe. It’s easy.” More than 53% of the state has been fully vaccinated. Sununu said he’s frustrated that more residents are not vaccinated, given the extensive effort made by the state to get vaccines out to the public, but he said he understands it is a personal choice.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in New Jersey should wear masks indoors when there is an increased risk of spreading the coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Murphy said the state’s coronavirus metrics are going in the wrong direction, and new data suggested the delta variant is more transmissible, “which is why we are making this strong recommendation.” Instances where masks are recommended include: crowded indoor settings, those involving close contact with others who aren’t fully vaccinated and those where someone’s vaccine status is unknown. Murphy made the recommendation in a joint statement with Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. Murphy’s recommendation didn’t address schools. Murphy spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said Wednesday there was no update yet on masks in schools. New Jersey has among the highest percentages of people vaccinated in the country.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A bountiful wildflower bloom at Bandelier National Monument is drawing some early risers who want to avoid the midday crowds, and the visitors center is responding to accommodate them. Starting Sunday, the visitor center will open a half-hour earlier at 8:30 a.m. Acting Superintendent Dennis Milligan said that will give staff more time to hand out information on trails and safety. The Southwest has been inundated with rain during the monsoon season, bolstering wildflowers. Mariposa lilies, harebells and shooting stars are abundant along trails like the Cerro Grande and Alamo Boundary at Bandelier. Monument officials said the massive wildflower bloom should last for several more weeks. They said visitors should feel free to photograph the flowers but don’t pick them so others can enjoy the view. Visitation to the monument that features canyons and ancient cliff dwellings dropped drastically during the pandemic. Officials said they’re now seeing a 157% increase in visitation since 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: A village in the Hamptons will pay its outgoing police chief more than $774,000 for unused sick and vacation time after village officials voted to end his contract. Southampton Village Police Chief Thomas Cummings’ contract contained provisions that allowed for the large payout, Newsday reported Wednesday. The village board voted on July 20 to end his contract on Sept. 10 and approved the payout. The agreement calculated 686 unused days at $1,095 per day, plus almost $23,000 in retroactive per diem pay. The newspaper obtained the information through public records requests. Cummings, 57, has been police chief in the village of the wealthy enclave since 2011, after joining the department in 1987. He had clashed with Mayor Jesse Warren, who won reelection in June, the newspaper reported. Warren criticized the contract that allowed the large payout in a statement Tuesday. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. He and his wife will also get medical and dental benefits without premiums for the rest of their lives, unless his wife were to remarry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health department will require workers, volunteers and others at 14 state-run health care facilities to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Sept. 30 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, according to a memo. The Associated Press obtained a departmental FAQ about the vaccine mandate that said those who don’t get fully vaccinated or exempted by the deadline could face “disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for unacceptable personal conduct.” Republican House Speaker Tim Moore first shed light on the development through a news release Tuesday night. Although he is vaccinated and encourages others to get the shots, he said he believes residents should have the ability to make their own decisions without fear of reprisal. The speaker also noted that none of the available COVID-19 vaccines the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use have thus far received full FDA approval. North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services did not comment on Moore’s criticism, but confirmed it will require many within the Division of State Operated Health Facilities to get vaccinated. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s office has not responded to questions about whether the governor supports a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for state workers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWatford City: The operator of an oil well pad where a fire has been burning since last week in McKenzie County has brought in a specialized emergency response crew to get a handle on the blaze. The well pad is located on federal land just south of Lake Sakakawea northeast of Watford City. Its operator, Petro-Hunt, is working with Texas-based Wild Well Control. “They can come in and know how to analyze or diagnose the problem and get to it,” said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. McKenzie County Emergency Manager Karolin Jappe said authorities have closed roads in the area and are asking people to avoid driving or boating near the fire, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The cause of the fire, which broke out Jan. 22, is unknown. Clouds of black smoke are rising from the blaze, causing state environmental officials to encourage nearby residents to monitor their local air quality at www.airnow.gov. Air quality is already poor in parts of North Dakota because of wildfire smoke from the western U.S. and Canada. Petro-Hunt initially reported to the state that an estimated 100 barrels of oil and 100 barrels of saltwater spilled at the site. The true volume of the spills is not yet known, Glatt said. The fire is contained to the well pad, and it has not resulted in any injuries, according to Petro-Hunt.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:A vandal defaced a large LeBron James-inspired “Space Jam” mural in Akron. A red clown nose was spray painted on James’ face, along with the words “LA FLOP” sometime early Monday morning on the artwork created by Copley artist Chardae Slater on the front of a West Market Street business. The mural is located not far from James’ alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Vincent High School, and the I Promise School he helped found for at-risk Akron children. Akron Police have been alerted to the vandalism and Slater said she’s hopeful businesses near the mural will be willing to share any security camera footage they might have that captured the culprit or culprits. James’ representatives did not return a request for comment Monday about the recent vandalism. Slater said it might take up to two weeks to fix the mural. “It’s fixable,” she said. “It’s just oh my God. I’m trying to keep positive.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: City employees who are unvaccinated for the coronavirus will not receive hazard leave if they contract the illness, Mayor G.T Bynum said. Hazard leave is paid leave that is not counted against sick days or vacation days, city spokesperson Michelle Brooks said. Affected unvaccinated employees could use sick days or vacation if they become ill with the virus. Ascension St. John Hospital in Tulsa announced its employees would be required to become vaccinated by Nov. 12, with exemptions possible for medical or religious regions. “Tens of thousands of Ascension associates have already been vaccinated with the available vaccines, as have millions of people across the country and the world,” Ascension said in a statement. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve.” Ascension joins OU Health, Mercy and SSM Health as hospitals in the state requiring employee vaccinations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A former Oregon lawmaker who was expelled for letting violent protesters into the state Capitol pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of official misconduct. The Statesman Journal reported that Mike Nearman was sentenced to 18 months probation, during which he will need to complete 80 hours of community service and is banned from the Capitol building and grounds. He will also pay $200 in court fees and $2,700 to the Oregon Legislative Administration for damages done during the Dec. 21 riot. As part of the agreement in Marion County Circuit Court, a count of criminal trespass was dismissed. Last month, Nearman, a Republican from Polk County, became the first member of the Oregon House to be expelled in its 160-year history. The House voted 59-1 to remove him from the Legislature for disorderly behavior. Nearman was seen on security video opening a door to protesters on Dec. 21 as lawmakers met in emergency session to deal with economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters barged into the building, which was closed to the public because of pandemic safety protocols, got into shoving matches with police and sprayed officers with bear spray. Some of the protesters had guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering a statewide mask mandate as coronavirus cases surge in Pennsylvania and across the country, and his administration said it is not requiring masks in schools. Wolf, speaking on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, said his strategy to fight the spread of COVID-19 has been the vaccine, and will continue to be. The masking mandate was for when there was no vaccine, Wolf said. “People have the ability, each individual to make the decision to get a vaccine,” Wolf said. “If they do, that’s the protection.” Wolf’s administration also said it is not considering mandating masks in K-12 schools. However, it said it is recommending that Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvania schools follow federal guidance on mask-wearing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s two largest health care systems are requiring all employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The announcements Tuesday by Lifespan and Care New England – which are moving toward a merger – came as the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention issued new face-covering guidelines. “It is our responsibility to keep our patients, and our staff, safe. This program will be based on the best evidence that we have to date about preventing transmission of COVID-19,” Dr. James Fanale, Care New England’s chief executive, said in a statement. Care New England said it would “move toward” requiring vaccinations by first requiring that all managers receive a first dose before Labor Day. More details will be released within the next seven to 10 days. Lifespan announced that its vaccine mandate will go into effect Sept. 1, and it is the system’s goal to have all employees show proof of immunization within 60 days. Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Bradley, Newport, and The Miriam hospitals. Care New England operates Butler, Kent, and Women & Infants hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are looking for people who might have come in contact with a rabid puppy or its missing littermate along the Georgia-South Carolina border. The Department of Health and Environmental Control said the agency recently identified a rabid puppy that was born in Edgefield County, near Lanier Road in the town of Johnston. The small, tan-and-white pit bull puppy was approximately 7 weeks old and weighed about 5 pounds. The dog and a littermate were taken to Augusta, Georgia, between July 14 and July 17. Both puppies were also taken to a gathering in Clearwater, South Carolina, about that time, the agency said. The rabid puppy was also taken to a birthday party in Florence, South Carolina. Health officials have yet to find the littermate or identify its rabies status. The health agency is now searching for people who attended the Clearwater gathering or might have had contact with the littermate puppy. “We are deeply concerned about all persons involved, as rabies is fatal if left untreated after exposure,” said Dr. Gil Potter, Midlands Region Medical Director. People who came in contact with the puppy’s saliva should seek medical attention, as they might have been exposed to rabies, the agency said. Animals can shed the virus for up to two weeks before showing symptoms of rabies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Staff and inmates at South Dakota prisons are no longer required to wear masks following an order from Gov. Kristi Noem lifting the requirement. Among neighboring states, South Dakota is the only one to lift a mask requirement in prisons, the Argus Leader reported. Noem’s move was spurred by a meeting she had with employees at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. They cheered when she told them they could remove their masks during a meeting Friday. The governor was at the prison to respond to an ongoing human resources investigation into complaints of low employee morale, shorthanded prison staff and insufficient tactical gear for corrections officers. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury told the Argus Leader the governor would have made the move even sooner if she was aware of the Department of Corrections policy. He said it was “common sense” given the rate of virus cases and would help boost employee morale. The Department of Corrections said 70% of inmates have received at least one vaccination. It does not track the vaccination rate among staff.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A group of state Senate Republicans are urging the public to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a move that comes as case numbers are beginning to again climb throughout the state. “Unfortunately, efforts to get more people vaccinated have been hampered by politicization of COVID-19,” the group of 17 lawmakers wrote in a letter Tuesday. “This should not be political.” Tennessee has faced increased national scrutiny over its low COVID-19 vaccination rates after the Department of Health fired its top vaccination chief and briefly halted outreach for childhood vaccines. Some GOP leaders have since gone on the defensive, with Gov. Bill Lee urging Tennesseans to get a COVID-19 shot after remaining mum on the subject for several weeks. On Tuesday, Senate Republican leadership reiterated that getting the vaccine was a “personal choice” but encouraged people to talk to their doctor about the vaccination.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Two people are dead and 30 were hospitalized after a chemical leak at a Houston-area plant, officials said. LyondellBasell said that about 100,000 pounds of a mixture that included acetic acid was released in the leak that started Tuesday night at its La Porte Complex. The company said that the “all clear” was given early Wednesday, and that the leak had been isolated and contained. The company said air monitoring was ongoing and hasn’t shown “actionable levels.” Two contractors were killed and 30 workers were taken to local hospitals for evaluation and treatment, the company said. Of those, it said 24 were treated and released. The names of the contractors who died were not immediately released. The cause was under investigation, the company said, adding it was cooperating with authorities. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen said that the chemicals involved can severely burn skin and are toxic if inhaled.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Flash floods caused extensive damage in Cedar City and led Mayor Maile Wilson-Edwards to declare a state of emergency. Residents of the basement apartments at University West Apartments said they lost everything they own after the flood waters reached several feet high, Fox13 news reported. Cheryl Beeston said her daughter and son-in-law, Cheyenne and Kyle Brunson, were at work when the floods hit, but their home is ruined. “It’s worse than I ever expected. They’ve been married – it’ll be five months tomorrow – and they’ve lost everything,” she said. One volunteer did manage to find her daughter’s wedding ring, though. “We’re so grateful for that,” Beeston said. “We’re grateful for all the help that’s here.” Parts of the Southern Utah University campus, including the stadium were also damaged alongside entire neighborhoods, business complexes and roads. A Walmart parking lot became a waist-high pond and drivers waded out to their cars with help from Walmart employees.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:More than a dozen blood donation opportunities are scheduled across Vermont in August as the American Red Cross is reporting a severe blood shortage. The need for donations is higher this summer as more people are seeking treatment after deferring care during the coronavirus pandemic, Northern New England Red Cross spokeswoman Mary Brant told the Burlington Free Press. Organ transplants and elective surgeries have increased. Hospital emergency rooms also are handling more trauma cases, Brant said. The Red Cross has been distributing 12% more blood products to hospitals across the country than it was during the same time last year, the newspaper reported. Vermonters are urged to make an appointment now to give blood by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, visiting redcrossblood.org or downloading the Red Cross Blood Donor app on a smartphone.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam introduced two more spending proposals for the state’s $4.3 billion share of federal coronavirus relief money, calling for investments in clean water projects and more than $860 million to replenish the fund that pays unemployment benefits. The Democratic governor has been incrementally rolling out his spending plans ahead of a special legislative session that begins next week, when lawmakers will vote on how to allocate the money from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said the state will follow federal guidance and recommend that people wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas where there is a worrying rate of COVID-19 - including people who are fully vaccinated. Inslee also said the state will continue to require that all students and employees of K-12 schools wear masks when instruction resumes for the upcoming school year. Inslee’s office said the masking guidance for the general public indoors in places with a substantial or high COVID-19 rate is a recommendation only, but the school masking requirement is state law. Health officials in more than a half-dozen western Washington counties were already recommending mask-wearing in indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status because of a rise in COVID-19 cases and the highly infectious delta variant.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The Clarksburg Water Board has made $416,000 available in its budget to address lead found in some customers’ household drinking water. The board won’t make capital purchases this year and postponed buying items including lab equipment and three trucks, The Exponent Telegram reported. “These items are needed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in the budget,” Jason Myers, the board’s general manager, said at a meeting on Tuesday. “However, with public health in mind … we’re willing to forgo this.” The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said funds are available to help with the problem but asked the board to outline how much of its own money could be used, according to Myers. On top of available aid from the health department and the Environmental Protection Agency, the board plans to request funding from the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council. The region’s planning and development council is also helping to find funding sources. Of the 120 water samples collected for lead testing that were returned as of Tuesday afternoon, only one was above an allowable limit set by the EPA. The lead issue was discovered when drinking water samples were collected from the homes of three children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels. The toxic metal can be particularly harmful to children. Multiple sources of exposure were identified, so the water couldn’t have been the sole cause of the higher levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he is stepping down from the volunteer position he has held since April 2019. Andrew Hitt departure comes just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, where Republicans are trying to retain the U.S. Senate seat held by Ron Johnson and defeat Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Hitt, 43, said he will leave the post upon election of a successor, which will take place by early September. Hitt, from Appleton, is an attorney with the Michael Best and Friedrich law firm and also is a partner in its lobbying arm, Michael Best Strategies. Hitt said he was leaving to focus on his family and private sector career. “It’s bittersweet to step down now with such an exciting election cycle ahead, but I know it is the right thing to do for my family and employer after the sacrifices they made so I could provide steady leadership at a crucial time,” Hitt said in a statement. Hitt was a visible chairman, working closely with party activists, insiders and office holders, raising money and also being the public face for the GOP in the media. During his time as chairman, the state GOP opened its first office in Milwaukee and also suffered a cyberattack where $2.3 million was stolen.\n\nWyoming\n\nDayton: Investigators found a man dead after a boy allegedly told authorities in Montana he killed his father. The 15-year-old allegedly confessed to authorities in the Hardin, Montana, area, leading investigators to find the body at a home in Dayton early Wednesday, Sheridan County sheriff’s officials said in a statement. Sheriff’s officials didn’t identify the boy or dead man. Sheriff’s officials and Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents were investigating, according to the statement. There was no threat to the public and people should keep away from the home to allow a thorough investigation, Undersheriff Levi Dominguez said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/22/goats-got-milk-winnebago-tribe-new-mexico-quake-news-around-states/117628544/", "title": "Goats got milk, Winnebago Tribe, New Mexico quake : News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMaxwell Air Force Base:The 908th Airlift Wing was among the units across the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command that was able to resume Physical Fitness Assessment testing for its members. Over the Unit Training Assembly weekend of July 10-11, more than 100 Reserve Citizen Airmen from the 908th participated in the testing in Montgomery, Ala., which provided wing leadership with important data. Healthy and fit airmen are better equipped to mitigate the stresses of living and working in the austere environments often encountered at deployed locations. However, social distancing protocols limited the options airmen had to participate in physical training. Combined with postponed testing, some airmen experienced a lack in the motivation to stay fit because they couldn’t participate in their preferred activity or sport. Now that restrictions have been lifted and testing has resumed, some airmen have regained the incentive to maintain an exercise regimen and healthier lifestyle.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state-run ferry system is proposing a winter schedule that suggests limited service for some southeast Alaskan communities and improved service for Kodiak Island and some parts of south-central Alaska. State transportation department spokesperson Andy Mills told CoastAlaska the draft schedule reflects the best the state can do given available funding and maintenance needs within the fleet. Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed about $8.5 million for vessel operations, which his budget office said would “align service with historical demand, while providing 18 months of funding to align the system’s budget with the calendar year.” The move to provide funding for operations for 18 months rather than the traditional 12 months was intended in part to provide more stability in scheduling. The draft, which the transportation department is taking public comment on, covers operations between October and April and calls for up to five ships operating at any one time. One of those, however, is a ferry that shuttles between Ketchikan and nearby Metlakatla.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State wildlife officials and conservationists are offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects in the recent poaching of a desert bighorn sheep at Gillespie Dam southwest of Phoenix. The illegal harvest of the ram occurred the evening of July 10 south of Buckeye, the Arizona Game and Fish Department said. Investigators said a group of five Asian males seen leaving the scene at approximately 8:30 p.m. in a gray sedan and a black sport utility vehicle might have been involved. Anyone with information can call Operation Game Thief hotline at (800) 352-0700 regarding case #21-002114. Tipsters might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 for information that leads to an arrest in this case. The Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society is offering an additional reward of $1,000 for information that leads to a conviction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Public health researchers called the rapid rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas a “raging forest fire,” and the state’s top health official warned that he expects significant outbreaks in schools. The model by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases a day in children under age 17. Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated. Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a “surge on top of this surge” when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated. Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Six more California counties are urging residents to wear masks in indoor public settings amid concerning upticks in coronavirus cases and continued circulation of the highly contagious delta variant. The latest recommendations from Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Ventura raise to 17 the number of counties now asking even fully vaccinated individuals to wear face coverings as a precaution while inside places such as grocery stores, movie theaters and retail outlets. So far, only one – Los Angeles County – has gone a step further and mandated that masks be worn in such settings. The city of Pasadena, which has its own independent health department, said it would do likewise later this week. The new round of advisories means that roughly 56% of Californians live in a county that either recommends or requires indoor masking for all individuals, including those vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Marijuana-related arrests have dropped since the first recreational pot shops opened in Colorado seven years ago but Black people are still much more likely to get into legal trouble for cannabis offenses, according to a state report released Monday. The biennial report, commissioned by the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, found that the marijuana arrest rate for Black people (160 per 100,000 people) is more than double that for white people (76 per 100,000) in Colorado, The Denver Post reported. The report also found that people over 65 are using marijuana at triple the rate that they did in 2014 and that people are consuming cannabis through vapes and edibles at higher rates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Terrence Cheng, president of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, said the state’s community colleges will forgive $17 million of student debt accumulated during the pandemic. The debt, which students took on during the pandemic or could not repay because of it, will be made up with money from the federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Cheng said. There are no conditions attached, and students are not required to enroll in classes in any future semesters, Cheng said. The decision is expected to impact 18,161 current and former students at the state’s 12 community colleges, officials said. That includes students who lost jobs, suffered food insecurity and even those who were afflicted with COVID-19 said Jane Gates, CSCU’s provost and senior vice president of academic and student affairs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The Delaware Democratic Party said that anti-Asian slurs and other sexual language used by state Rep. Gerald Brady in an email “will not be tolerated,” but stopped short of demanding that he resign. The outcry came after a June 27 email sent by Brady was shared with The News Journal. The email was intended to be sent to a private citizen Brady knows, said Drew Volturo, a spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady replied to a sex workers’ advocate who had emailed him to discuss legislation intended to protect sex workers. “Misogynistic, anti-Asian language has no place in our Party and calls into question the integrity of any leader,” Betsy Maron, chair of the Delaware Democratic Party, said in a written statement. “No apology will rectify the fact that Representative Gerald Brady felt comfortable enough to use such hateful language behind closed doors.” When asked if the party was calling on Brady to step down, Democratic spokeswoman Sarah Fulton said no. “If Gerald Brady doesn’t want to resign, that’s something that he is going to have to deal with when he looks his constituents in the face next fall and tries to justify why they should vote for him,” Fulton said. Brady sent a written apology Monday through a spokesman. He also posted his apology on his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:For the first time in decades, D.C.’s Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will open to the public on April 18, 2022, WUSA-TV reported. According to a news release from the Church of Latter-day Saints, invited guests will be available to take private tours of the renovated temple between April 19-27. The temple will then hold a public open house for two months, except Sundays, starting April 28 and running through June 4.Ticket information for the public open house will be made available at the DC Temple website, here. The Church of Latter-day Saints said the Temple first opened in 1974 and was closed in March 2018 to undergo a significant renovation. According to Dan Holt, the project manager, the renovations added “21st-century flair” to the temple's midcentury motif to make the temple “more maintainable, more modern and really relevant for today.” The last time the temple was open to the public was from Sept. 17 to Oct. 19, in 1974, when more than 750,000 people toured the building.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Officials in Florida’s most populous county are encouraging residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as infection rates once again spike in the state. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and other government, public safety and health officials released a statement Tuesday urging people to take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Miami-Dade has achieved a vaccination rate of more than 75%, according to the Florida Department of Health. In less than a month, positive tests have increased from 3.6% to 8.6% in Miami-Dade County, officials said. In the last three weeks, the number of COVID-positive inpatients at Miami’s Jackson Health System has increased 178%. More than 95% of the new patients are unvaccinated, and more than 40% are under age 50.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations around the world is starting to reach Georgia, experts said, driven by the infection’s spread among the unvaccinated. Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nevada are in full-fledged outbreaks, and neighboring states are following behind, Emory University Professor Carlos del Rio said in a briefing. In the past week, Georgia’s hospitalizations from the disease have increased 30%, he said. The highly contagious delta variant now accounts for about 70% of all new cases, most of which are among those who haven’t been vaccinated, including children too young for the shots. Of the 480 Georgia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 this month, 416 were not fully vaccinated, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Dozens of Maui residents held a rally for affordable housing as the county’s median home price tops $1 million and the county council considers a new affordable housing plan. Stand Up Maui organized the affordable housing rally, which gathered more than 40 people along Kaahumanu Avenue on Monday, The Maui News reported. “Build affordable housing now,” resident Faith Chase yelled through a bullhorn. Median home prices in Maui County hit $1,117,500 in June – the highest in the state. The figure was up 45% from $773,250 during the same month last year. At the Maui County Council, a committee heard testimony about a new affordable housing plan. Some said the county should require that candidates for affordable housing have at least 20 years of residency. But the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Plan called for two years of residency. The affordable housing plan called for the county to spend $380 million on infrastructure, including roads, water and wastewater projects. Another $789 million would support housing for locals, including subsidies for rentals and mortgages.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, acting as governor with Gov. Brad Little out of the state, on Tuesday sent what she called a formal inquiry to the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare concerning private health care businesses requiring their employees get COVID-19 vaccines. McGeachin, who is running for governor, said the Biden administration could be behind the requirement, citing a lengthy proposed rule in the federal register published in May having to do with Medicare that has several references to vaccine coverage among health care workers. As acting governor in May, McGeachin issued an executive order banning mask mandates that Little nullified when he returned. Little is in Colorado meeting with other Republican governors and is scheduled to return Wednesday, spokeswoman Marissa Morrison said. McGeachin has said she wants to find out why three large Idaho health care providers are requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two state agencies that oversee higher education in Illinois on Monday encouraged colleges and universities to require COVID-19 vaccinations of students heading to campuses this fall. The Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois Community College Board made the recommendation, which they said follows recently released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state agencies contend the guidance will help facilitate the safe transition back to campus, as more students return to in-person learning. The oversight agencies’ recommendation came on the same day a federal judge ruled Indiana University can require its students and employees to get vaccinated before returning to campus for fall classes. Students who don’t comply will have their registration canceled and workers who don’t will lose their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said 60% of incoming students and 66% of school employees have submitted proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 four weeks ahead of an Aug. 13 fall semester deadline. Purdue announced the figures Tuesday in its first release of overall campus vaccination rates. Purdue said it is strongly encouraging all students and employees to get the vaccine if possible. The university expects the numbers of those fully vaccinated will grow before the first day of fall classes Aug. 23, said Eric Barker, dean of the College of Pharmacy and leader of the Protect Purdue Health Monitoring and Surveillance team. Vaccination rates for Purdue students are about twice the rate compared with individuals ages 16-29 across the state, the school said. Individuals not vaccinated who have a high-risk exposure must quarantine for 14 days and will not be allowed to attend classes or report to work, regardless of symptoms, Purdue said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a high-risk exposure as coming within 6 feet of an infected individual for 15 minutes or more where both individuals are not wearing masks.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Waterloo Community Schools will seek federal stimulus dollars to help fund internet access and computers for students whose families can’t afford them. The district is applying for money through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On Tuesday, the Board of Education approved the purchase of 593 Dell touchscreen Chromebook laptops at a cost of $148,843 during a special meeting. The ECF includes a provision that allows districts to seek funding for laptop computers when they will be used by students who lack devices sufficient to engage in remote learning. As a result, Waterloo Schools will “target our virtual students, who obviously need a suitable device,” said Matt O’Brien, the district’s director of technology. The touchscreen functionality has been identified as being important for the district’s virtual learners, especially those in elementary school. Reimbursement will be sought from the fund for the entire cost.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Families and advocates for the elderly in Kansas argue that with most nursing home residents vaccinated against COVID-19, some facilities’ visiting rules need to be relaxed, though the delta variant’s spread is making operators nervous. A state official who investigates complaints against nursing homes and the elder-care focused Kansas Advocates for Better Care are calling on the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services to crack down on homes that aren’t open enough. They’re concerned that the delta variant will prompt new lockdowns. The aging department said it is working to ensure that residents and families have a voice in visitation policies, though some industry officials still see a need to proceed with caution. The debate showed how operators feel they’re still facing tough choices after nursing homes were COVID-19 hot spots early on during the pandemic. It also shows how residents’ and families’ anguish and anger still linger.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State University’s president resigned Tuesday amid concerns about the school’s financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. The school’s Board of Regents accepted M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation at a specially called meeting, news media outlets reported. Brown’s resignation came after four years on the job. The regents named Clara Ross Stamps as the school’s acting president. Stamps has been a senior vice president and spokeswoman at the university. The board also voted to hire auditors to review the school’s financial situation. Stamps declined afterward to provide any information about possible problems or the reason for Brown’s departure, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Brown’s departure came amid a half-dozen lawsuits pending this year accusing college officials, including Brown, of various acts of misconduct, the newspaper reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and said it’s the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since June 19. The numbers were announced as state officials continued to stress the need for vaccination. Figures posted Wednesday showed 1.6 million people, about 36% of the state’s population are fully vaccinated. The seven-day average of new cases reported daily in New Orleans had jumped to 99 by Tuesday, up from 11 two weeks ago. Mayor LaToya Tidwell said vaccinations are the key to stopping the spread, which is fueled by the highly contagious delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. Restrictions on gatherings and mask requirements had been greatly eased in recent months as vaccines became widely available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has decided to continue a pandemic rule to allow outdoor dining and retail in place until at least the fall. Portland is looking to end a local emergency declaration about the pandemic on July 29. That would also end additional powers given to the city manager that can restrict public gatherings. However, street closures that allow businesses to expand outdoor dining and retail options will continue until November, the Portland Press Herald reported. The council voted that a designation allowing restaurants to operate without additional fees will continue until Nov. 1. A statewide emergency declaration about the pandemic ended in June. Maine has had a lower burden of coronavirus cases than many other states, though cases have increased somewhat in recent days.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The leader of the Maryland National Guard is warning that training missions and equipment maintenance are in peril if the state isn’t reimbursed soon for the Guard’s response to the Jan. 6 insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol. Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen, the adjutant general for the Maryland National Guard, warned in a letter Tuesday to members of Congress that the Guard is so short on money that he might have to resort to deep budget cuts in the coming weeks. Maryland Guard members were among the first to arrive in Washington on Jan. 6 when the Capitol building was disrupted during the certification of the 2020 election results. After a delay in getting the sign-off from federal officials, the state sent 500 Guard members, a number that swelled to about 1,000 over the next few weeks. The deployment to Washington came in the midst of an unprecedented and busy time for the Guard, whose members helped run coronavirus testing sites and food distribution programs and were preparing to staff mass vaccination clinics at the time of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City health officials urged recent visitors to Provincetown to self-isolate and get tested for the coronavirus after a cluster of cases was linked to the popular Cape Cod tourist town. At least 35 cases of COVID-19 in Boston have been traced to Provincetown, with the vast majority of cases involving people who were fully vaccinated, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. Anyone who has traveled to Provincetown since July 1 is being asked to get tested at least five days after returning. The travel guidance also asks recent visitors to self-isolate and avoid gatherings for at least five days and until they receive a negative coronavirus test. Provincetown officials issued a new mask advisory on Monday after more than 100 people tested positive following the Fourth of July holiday. The advisory encourages mask-wearing for all residents and visitors of the town, which is a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Marais: A wildfire burned about 6 acres of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and adjacent state forest in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard vessel reported the fire about 3 p.m. Monday near the Twelvemile Beach campground at Pictured Rocks, they said. Park rangers said large amounts of smoke might linger for the next few days in the area and along Highway 58 near the Kingston Lake campground. The investigation into how the fire started is continuing. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Burt Township firefighters and Pictured Rocks park rangers extinguished the fire.“Thank you to all our agency partners who reported and helped us keep this fire under control,” Chief Ranger Joseph Hughes said in a statement. “I would like to remind all park visitors to recreate safely. Drivers and visitors should slow down and use caution in the area.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota’s most populous county is boosting its incentive program for COVID-19 vaccine shots. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved an additional $250,000 to promote vaccine shots, on top of the original $100,000 that was allocated earlier from federal recovery funds. Commissioner Chris LaTondresse said the program has increased the number of shots and Tuesday’s action “doubles down on this promising strategy” to help fight the coronavirus. The county used the original investment to buy 2,235 Visa gift cards worth $50 each. As of Monday. about 775 of those cards had been distributed, mainly at county public health events. The incentive program includes partnerships with community groups to host vaccine events and provide perks such as free meals, groceries, and entertainment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With a national moratorium on evictions scheduled to end at the end of this month, millions of dollars in federal rental and utility assistance is still available for low-income tenants in Mississippi. The funds, provided by Congress, are disbursed through the Mississippi Home Corporation. Eligible for the benefits are Mississippians making 80% or less of the median area income whose ability to pay rent or utilities was disrupted by the pandemic. For example, in Hinds County, a three-person household making $52,300 or less a year is eligible for assistance. There is more than $180 million available to state residents, and Home Corporation Executive Director Scott Spivey said he hopes more people apply for the assistance.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The St. Louis area is facing a third wave of COVID-19 that could cause more deaths and serious cases if residents don’t get vaccinated and return to wearing masks in public, the head of the region’s pandemic task force said. Dr. Clay Dunagan, BJC HealthCare’s chief clinical officer, said seven COVID-19 patients have died in the St. Louis region and 91 were admitted to intensive care units during the 24 hours before he issued his plea Tuesday morning. He said if residents don’t respond, the area could return to high hospitalization rates, prompting renewed visitor restrictions and delayed elective procedures. He said even people who have been vaccinated should wear masks in public, in part because only 46.3% of Missourians had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, which significantly trailed the national average. Also Tuesday, officials from St. Louis County and St. Louis issued a joint statement echoing Dunagan’s remarks. They said they are watching trends and paying attention to mask mandates initiated by other jurisdictions.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Environmental groups pressed a state judge to order a new review of a Montana copper mine over worries that mining waste will pollute a river that’s popular among boaters. Attorneys for Trout Unlimited and other groups argued that state officials did not adequately review the risk of toxic waste spills from the Black Butte copper mine north of White Sulphur Springs. Work began last year on the mine along Sheep Creek, a tributary of the Smith River. Montana Department of Environmental Quality attorney Sarah Clerget rejected worries the mine would pollute the Smith during Friday’s hearing before state District Judge Katherine Bidegary in Meagher County. Clerget said the mine won’t leak or fail, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The underground mine proposed by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. The 110-mile Smith River runs through a limestone canyon and a scenic valley before flowing into the Missouri River south of Great Falls. The waterway is so popular the state holds an annual lottery for permits to float down it.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinnebago: A mask mandate has been reinstated on the Winnebago Reservation to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska said in a post on its Facebook page that masks are required for all indoors in public buildings and places of business within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. During a meeting Monday, the Winnebago Tribal Council voted 6-1 to reinstate the mask mandate. According to a report from Twelve Clans Unity Hospital, as of Monday, there were 12 active cases of the virus on the reservation and six households in quarantine. On June 25, the Winnebago Public Health Department reported that 70% of community members ages 12 and up had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Tribal officials touted the vaccination rate as the highest in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei said he hasn’t decided whether to run for reelection or mount a bid for Nevada governor, but appears unimpressed by the Republican primary field vying to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Certainly no one has sucked the air out of the room, in a Republican primary sense, which Steve Sisolak must be happy about. Nevada Republicans need a strong gubernatorial candidate in 2022,” he said. Amodei, a Carson City Republican, said he didn’t feel rushed to make a decision with the primary election 11 months away. If he enters the race, Amodei will join Sheriff Joe Lombardo, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee and Reno attorney Joey Gilbert in the Republican primary field. Former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller has told Republican groups that he’s also mulling a run. Amodei has served in Congress since 2011 and previously represented Carson City in the Nevada statehouse. He continues to raise campaign contributions toward another congressional run.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: Surveyors with the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands have found widespread defoliation attributed to a population boom of moth caterpillars. Kyle Lombard, the coordinator of the division’s forest health program, said that the department has surveyed 20% of the state and found 30,000 acres of defoliation. The affected trees are primarily clumps of red and black oaks, WCVB-TV reported. According to the department, the last time the state experienced more than 10,000 to 15,000 acres of defoliation was in 1992. Lombard said that areas with a lot of oaks will look weird; however, the defoliation should not affect the foliage season. The trees that largely produce the bright oranges, reds and yellows are primarily maples, aspens and ash, which are not affected by the moth larvae. Lombard said that the real concern is that if the moth population continues to expand, it will increase the amount of dry brush across a larger area, increasing the risk of fires.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A state appeals court ruled Gov. Phil Murphy didn’t overstep his authority when he issued an executive order last year allowing tenants to use their security deposits to pay rent. The ruling rejected arguments by several businesses and individual landlords who argued Murphy wasn’t authorized to issue the order in April 2020 and that their due process rights were violated. In a tweet, Acting State Attorney General Andrew Bruck praised the ruling and said Murphy’s executive order “supported renters and helped keep them in their homes.” The attorney general’s office argued the case on behalf of Murphy, a Democrat; former attorney general Gurbir Grewal and state health commissioner Judy Persichilli, who also were named as defendants. Under Murphy’s order, landlords were still entitled to reimbursement for expenses that would have been covered by a security deposit, and tenants were obligated to replenish the deposit in full if they renewed the lease.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMalaga: The U.S. Geological Survey recorded an earthquake near the Eddy and Lea County line Monday morning, nearly 23 miles east-southeast of Malaga. Susan Torres, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department , said the earthquake was reported about 5:30 a.m. The USGS considered the earthquake light. The Carlsbad Brine Well remediation project, located south of Carlsbad where U.S. highways 285 and 62/180 converge to form the South Y, detected the activity. The readings indicated the Brine Well pressure was stable. Eddy County Fire and Rescue Chief Joshua Mack said volunteer fire departments did not respond to any emergency calls in the area. Carlsbad Fire Chief Richard Lopez said no damage or injuries were reported in the city limits. The USGS has reported six other earthquakes near the Texas-New Mexico state line nearly 60 miles south of Carlsbad since July 13. The magnitude of those earthquakes was less than 4.0.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will have to get vaccinated or get tested weekly under a policy announced Wednesday to fight a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Publicly employed nurses, doctors, social workers, custodians, registrars and colleagues will be covered under the order from city Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi, and Mayor Bill de Blasio didn’t rule out applying the same requirement to teachers, police officers and other city employees. The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated. But the rate among public hospital system workers is lower: about 60%, according to Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs it. Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children would need parental permission before they could receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use in legislation that advanced through a state Senate committee Wednesday. The parent or guardian requirement is contained in a bill approved by the Senate Health Care Committee that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The permission is designed to address concerns by some parents and legislators that young people could get a new COVID-19 immunization on their own while it is still authorized for emergency use, said Sen. Jim Burgin, a Harnett County Republican. Only the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is available to children from 12 to 17. North Carolina law allows these children to make the decision on their own, “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Oil production is flat in North Dakota because of a workforce shortage as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Companies said they are in need of workers to inject water, sand and chemicals down wells to crack open rock and release oil, a process known as hydraulic fracking. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said eight crews are working in North Dakota, down from at least 20 which would typically be working in the state at today’s oil prices. “Most of these folks went to Texas where activity was still significantly higher than it was here, where they didn’t have winter and where there were jobs in their industry,” Helms told the Bismarck Tribune. “It’s going to take higher pay and housing incentives and that sort of thing to get them here.” North Dakota’s oil production rose 4,000 barrels per day in May, a negligible increase. The state produced about 1 million barrels of oil per day in May, the latest month for which data is available. The fracking side of the industry is also experimenting with new techniques to reduce costs. One company is using saltwater to replace some of the freshwater used in the fracking process. The fluid is being transported several miles through a flat line hose tucked inside another hose to prevent leaks until it reaches a fracking site, Helms said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio anti-abortion group is protesting a local Catholic university’s involvement in playing host to President Joe Biden in a CNN town hall Wednesday night. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati urged members of the public Tuesday to call Mount St. Joseph University and Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis Schnurr to object to the school’s decision. The group, which opposes abortion, said the suburban Cincinnati university is playing host to the “most pro-abortion president in U.S. history.” Biden, the nation’s second Catholic president, has said he supports abortion rights for others while personally opposing the procedure. He and other Catholic politicians who take Communion while supporting abortion rights were the subject of a rebuke by U.S. bishops last month. The university defended its involvement in the event, saying in a statement that Mount St. Joseph “has always been and will continue to be a diverse and inclusive place where people from different races, ethnicities, social backgrounds, beliefs, and religions can come together to discuss and share their unique perspectives.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A coalition of state health officials pleaded with Oklahomans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus as the number of cases and hospitalizations rise in the state. Aaron Wendelboe, an epidemiologist at the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health, said hospitalizations have nearly tripled since June. The state health department reported a seven-day average of 733 new cases daily, double the average of 364 from a week ago. “On average, each infected person with COVID is transmitting it to 2.9 other people,” compared to each infected person who transmitted the illness to two people in June, Wendelboe said. The health department reported a three-day average of 409 people hospitalized with COVID, almost four times the average of 116 in late June, topping 400 for the first time since early June. Assistant Deputy Health Commissioner Buffy Heater said 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, “which further indicates to us that vaccines are safe and continue to be effective against all strains or all variants of COVID.” Oklahoma ranks ninth in the nation with 209.2 new virus cases per 100,000 residents, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is being forced to make immediate and extensive changes to the way it operates the 13 dams in the Willamette Valley, including Detroit Dam, to give native species of fish a chance to survive. Under an order from U.S. District Court Judge Marco Hernandez issued July 16, the Corps will be forced to take actions such as improving fish passage and water quality, deep drawdowns of water to allow juvenile fish to pass downstream, spilling water at different times of year, and releasing adult fish above the dams. Hernandez's order laid out broad actions; a later final judgment will contain specifics. According to a statement from the Corps, it is reviewing Hernandez’s opinion to determine the next steps it will take to comply with it.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Local Catholics attending Mass last Sunday sounded happy that Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson Pérez has reinstated the religious obligation to attend Mass in person starting next month, ending a 16-month dispensation during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think he should have done it a long time ago,” said Nathan Hook, just before he and his fiancée, Jessica Rosario, walked into St. Agatha-St. James Church in West Philadelphia. “The dispensation makes people think church isn’t that important. But you need to be in person to receive the sacraments.” The in-person attendance directive, effective Aug. 15, has exceptions. Just as before the pandemic, the church recognizes that people might not be able to gather in person because of illness, caregiving responsibilities, or health risks. Pérez’s statement said lingering pandemic anxiety about crowds is also a valid reason to stay home and, if possible, join online.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s courts are preparing to resume regular operations this fall. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell issued an executive order that will lift most coronavirus restrictions by Sept. 7. The Boston Globe reported the new order will allow the public to return to all judicial buildings, with some restrictions. Fully vaccinated people will not be required to wear a mask, unless judges mandate it in their courtrooms. The public will be able to file court documents in-person by Sept. 7. Coronavirus cleaning protocols and plexiglass safety barriers installed in courtrooms will remain at least until the end of the year. During the early days of the pandemic, Suttell ordered courts shuttered for all but emergency matters. Like other court systems, most judicial proceedings were held remotely. The court system has been easing back into in-person operations with grand juries and bench trials resuming last summer. Jury trials resumed late last year as some courtrooms were outfitted with plexiglass.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Three Republican U.S. House members have lost appeals challenging fines for not wearing face coverings on the House floor earlier this year. On Tuesday, the U.S. House Ethics Committee released statements noting that U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina had failed in their appeals of $500 fines issued in May. The Republicans challenged the fines in June, arguing that the mandate was out of sync with recent federal guidance on face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vote in question happened a week after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance noting that “fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing.” At the time, face coverings were still required on the floor, a mandate put in place by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in June 2020. Even after the updated CDC guidance in May, Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, wrote that “mask requirement and other guidelines remain unchanged until all Members and floor staff are fully vaccinated.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A fraternity of the far-right group Proud Boys has withdrawn its sponsorship of a street dance in the town of Scotland in September. David Finnell applied on behalf of the group to have the street dance from noon until midnight Sept. 18 in the Bon Homme County community of about 700 people. The City Council approved the request to close a section of the city street as required for alcohol consumption and food vendors. Finnell, in a Facebook message to KELO-TV, said the Proud Boys were dropping sponsorship of the event out of concerns for safety. He did not elaborate. Scotland’s city attorney, Kent Lehr, said although the Proud Boys have gained some negative national attention, there have not been any problems locally. It’s his understanding that several local or area residents are associated with the Proud Boys, Lehr said. “I’m not saying the city is condoning or agreeing with what the group says,” Lehr said. The council had to evaluate the street dance request from the Proud Boys as it evaluates any other request, he said. “It has to consider the benefit to the community, any potential disruption (to closing street and caused by the event), the benefit to businesses on Main Street,” Lehr said. Finnell said the Proud Boys planned to raise money for local nonprofits before deciding on Monday to withdraw from the event.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials said they have finished deconstructing emergency COVID-19 care sites in Nashville and Memphis. According to a news release, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said this week that the sites finished serving their purpose of providing additional hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients. “Tennessee’s alternate care sites provided our health care system with a margin of safety, and thankfully we did not need to open either site,” Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement. The Memphis site, which was the former home of The Commercial Appeal, was renovated to provide more than 400 beds. The Nashville site opened in late May and provided 67 beds. “The Memphis and Nashville sites are models of what the public and private sector can accomplish working together,” TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan said in a statement. All medical equipment and supplies from both sites have been returned to TEMA’s warehouse.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Emergency officials have lifted a shelter-in-place order that was issued Wednesday morning for parts of a Houston-area city after a chemical release at a plant. The order had been issued for parts of La Porte, a city about 25 miles southeast of Houston. La Porte Emergency Management said earlier that residents in the affected area should stay indoors, turn their air conditioning off and close windows. Dow Chemical, which operates a plant in the area, said in a public alert message that a “release event” from a tank truck had occurred but did not specify what chemicals were involved. Harris County Pollution Control said in a statement that a tank wagon overpressurized, which caused a release of the chemical hydroxyethyl acrylate. The chemical can cause irritation of the nose and throat, the statement said. An evacuation order remained in place for people within a half-mile of the plant, which is located in an industrial area.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The Utah County sheriff is offering an active-shooter training class for teachers and it has filled up long before its start date. Trainers at the Teachers Academy include police, self-defense trainers and medical professionals for the 20-hour course informed by lessons learned in other active shooter incidents, the Daily Herald reported. Topics covered during the Teacher Academy training will include tactical emergency medical techniques, weapons familiarization, Utah concealed carry certification, tactical de-escalation, self-defense and live range-shooting. This is the third Teachers Academy class held since 2019. It’s designed for teachers, administrators, and school support staff. Participants for the session beginning Aug. 3 are limited to 30 people, and spots have already filled up and a wait list has started.\n\nVermont\n\nHyde Park: Grappling with a changed industry, two brothers operating their family’s dairy farm have made the drastic decision to give up hundreds of cows for goats. The Jones family, which had raised cows for 150 years at Joneslan Farm, houses about 1,000 goats in their barn that remains adorned with painted cutouts of dairy cattle. Fluctuating milk prices paid to dairy cow farmers and rising costs have driven some small family farms to go big or out of business – or get creative like brothers Brian and Steven. The Jones brothers finished constructing their nanny-milking parlor and delivered their first goat milk earlier this year to Land O’ Lakes-owned Vermont Creamery, to be used for cheese-making. They plan to milk 1,200 to 1,500 dairy goats within two years. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of dairy cow farms fell by more than half between 2003 and 2020 while the number of cows nationwide grew as farms consolidated. At the same time, the dairy goat industry in the U.S. has grown significantly in the last 20 years, with the number of dairy goats rising from more than 190,000 in 1997 to 440,000 last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration issued new guidance Wednesday on COVID-19 prevention measures for the upcoming school year, urging but not requiring continued masking in many circumstances. With a statewide public health order that had mandated masking in schools coming to an end Sunday, school divisions will have the ability to implement local policies “based on community level conditions and public health recommendations,” the Democratic administration said in a news release. The departments of health and education released a 14-page document with advice about reducing the spread of the coronavirus, addressing issues like ventilation and physical distancing, in addition to masking. The recommendations urge school divisions for now to adopt a universal masking policy for students and adults in elementary schools, regardless of vaccination status, because no vaccine has been approved yet for children under 12. For middle and high schools, the state guidance said that “at a minimum” teachers, students and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated should wear masks indoors. The guidance provides flexibility for school divisions while ensuring a safe and healthy environment, Northam said in a statement, which also encouraged Virginians to get vaccinated if they have not already.\n\nWashington\n\nKelso: Authorities are searching for an Army lieutenant reported missing near Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington. The Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office said crews are searching for a missing hiker, identified as 1st Lt. Brian Yang in the Coldwater area of Mount St. Helens. KOIN reported Yang, 25, was last seen at the Coldwater Trail Head about noon Sunday. According to its Twitter account, the Army’s I Corps is aware of Yang’s absence and is also involved in the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Dozens of labor and advocacy groups called on President Joe Biden to save nearly 1,500 jobs at a pharmaceutical plant in West Virginia scheduled to close at the end of July. Drugmaker Viatris Inc. announced in December it will lay off workers at the Morgantown plant, formerly operated by the generic drug company Mylan. Upjohn and Mylan’s merged last year to form the new company, which announced it would slash 20% of its workforce worldwide. Viatris is now one of the world’s dominant manufacturers in the generics industry, which has been consolidating for years. The moves left workers scrambling to find new jobs as the major employer left West Virginia, which is often trying to lure new companies to uplift the state’s stagnant economy. A new campaign led by Our Revolution, a political nonprofit organization founded by Bernie Sanders, urged Biden to use the Defense Production Act to halt Pittsburgh-based Viatris from closing the plant. It also asks Biden to convene a task force of labor groups, local leaders and others to determine how the plant might continue producing pharmaceutical or medical goods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is again asking ruffed grouse hunters to submit samples during the final year of a four-year, multistate ruffed grouse West Nile virus study. The DNR and conservation partners will distribute testing kits to hunters to get more samples as biologists try to determine how many grouse are getting West Nile and what impacts the disease is having on the grouse population. Anyone else who finds a sick or entact dead grouse can also submit samples. Hunters who have a kit from a previous year are encouraged to collect a sample, fill the kit and send it in to be processed; nothing in the kit expires. Kits will be available in early September. The DNR might limit the number of kits per individual to ensure samples come from a large geographic area. The DNR will provide test results via email. Sample testing will not begin until after the grouse season has closed and final results will not be available for several months after that. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus and its effects on birds can vary. Signs range from no clinical disease or illness to heart lesions and inflammation of the brain’s lining and spinal cord. There is no evidence that West Nile can be spread by handling dead birds or consuming properly cooked game.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon is allowing truck drivers to work longer hours while they deliver fuel that might be needed for firefighting aircraft. So far this summer, Wyoming hasn’t had significant fuel shortages or major wildfires. Gordon’s office described Tuesday’s executive order as a preemptive measure because of high fuel demand amid record tourism and firefighting efforts elsewhere. “Part of the reason he signed the executive order was really to make sure that it wasn’t a transportation hiccup that was preventing fuel from making it to its destination,” Gordon spokesman Michael Pearlman told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other Western governors, including South Dakota’s Kristi Noem, have signed similar orders. Government rules usually limit truck drivers’ road hours to prevent fatigue-related accidents. The Wyoming order still prohibits truck drivers from driving when tired.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/21/gator-attack-daring-plane-landing-salmon-surging-news-around-states/117602984/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama public health officials are warning people to avoid eating any fish from some state waterways because of contamination. The state Department of Public Health issued its latest fish consumption advisories this month. They are based on nearly 500 samples of specific fish species taken during the fall of 2020 from 41 bodies of water, health officials said. Restrictions on consumption are broken down by waterbody and presented as the safe number of meals of a species that can be eaten in a given period of time. In some locations, people are advised to avoid all fish. Mercury is often cited as the fish contaminant of concern.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: It has been a record-breaking year for sockeye salmon catches in Alaska’s Bristol Bay Nushagak District this year, an official said. “We’re approaching 27 million total run,” said Tim Sands, a state Department of Fish and Game area management biologist. “Our average run would be 9 million, so to be triple the average is amazing.” The region has experienced numerous record-breaking days, Fairbanks television station KTVF reported. The record for catch in the Nushagak District on one day was more than 1.7 million set on June 30. “Then the very next day we broke it again at 1.8 million,” Sands said. “For perspective, up until 2017, we never had a single day in the history of this district where we harvested a million sockeye in a day. We did it seven days (this year).” Other Bristol Bay areas also are doing well. “I can tell you right now in Bristol Bay, we’re over 35 million harvest, and we probably have, I’d say, probably close to another 5 million at least to go,” he said. Sands said he He is hopeful the strong run will continue next year. “I’m not a forecaster, but certainly I am optimistic that next year for sure should be a very good year,” Sands said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has appointed a former longtime Arizona Public Service lobbyist and a retired Microsoft executive to oversee Arizona’s three universities. Ducey announced Monday he’s picked Jessica Pacheco and Bob Herbold to fill two vacant seats on the Arizona Board of Regents. Pacheco was vice president of external affairs for APS parent company Pinnacle West Capital Corp., before leaving last year to start a public affairs firm. She oversaw the utility’s lobbying, political activities and public image when it controversially spent millions to elect favored regulators. Herbold had a long career with Proctor & Gamble and Microsoft before retiring in 2001 as chief operating officer of the software giant. He now runs a foundation that provides scholarships to graduates studying engineering and computer science, according to the governor’s office. The Board of Regents oversees Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. Pacheco and Herbold replace Karrin Taylor Robson, who left to enter the Republican primary for governor, and Kathryn Hackett King, whom Ducey appointed to the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus jumped by 106 over the weekend in Arkansas, which is leading the nation in new virus cases per capita. The Department of Health said Monday that the state’s virus hospitalizations increased to 787. Of those, 291 patients are in intensive care and 124 patients are on ventilators. Most of the new hospitalizations, 79, occurred since Sunday, the department said. The state’s virus cases increased over the past three days by 2,552 to 365,132 total since the pandemic began. The state reported 15 new deaths. The department recently stopped reporting daily COVID-19 numbers on weekends, releasing the figures on Mondays instead. Arkansas’ cases have surged in recent weeks because of the delta variant of the virus and a low number of people getting vaccinated. Only 35% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A California initiative that would require state regulators to reduce plastic waste has qualified for the November 2022 ballot, officials said. Secretary of State Shirley Weber’s office said the initiative exceeded the required 623,212 valid petition signatures needed for the measure to go before voters next year. If passed, the law would compel the state to take multiple steps to reduce plastic waste, including requiring that single-use plastic packaging, containers and utensils be reusable, recyclable, or compostable. Producers of single-use plastic packaging would be taxed, with the revenue allocated for recycling and environmental programs. In addition, the state Legislature would be prohibited from reducing funding to specified state environmental agencies below 2019 levels. The measure is supported by a coalition of environmental groups.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:Colorado State University Pueblo’s campus ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic was recently judged as one of the nation’s best. The American Association of State Colleges and Universities recently selected CSU Pueblo to receive its 2021 Excellence and Innovation Award for Campus Pandemic Response for its submission, “A Study in COVID-19 Response and Planning: Pandemics and the Resiliency of CSU Pueblo, the People’s University.” One of its highlights: After partnering with Maryland-based medical technology company Spartan medical – which in turn partnered with data company NTT Data Services – to expand the university’s capabilities for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing on campus, CSU Pueblo reduced positivity rates from 20% to 1% in the partnership’s first six weeks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A coalition of state agencies and organizations launched a new “elder justice hotline” on Monday to provide a “one stop shop” to help older people navigate state services, for everything from age-based discrimination to neglect issues. The hotline and an online complaint portal became operational on Monday. Amy Porter, commissioner of the Department of Aging and Disability Services, said this new centralized number, (860) 808-5555, will make it easier for people to find the support they need. Staffed by the Consumer Assistance Unit of the state Attorney General’s office, it will operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. Callers will be referred to the appropriate state agency for help.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes:Sen. Ernie López, a Republican from Sussex County, said he will retire from the General Assembly next year. The senator has held his beach-bestrewed seat, which includes Milton, Lewes and Rehoboth Beach, since 2013. He was the first Hispanic American elected to the state Senate, according to his biography on the General Assembly’s website. He announced Friday that he will step down when his term ends in November 2022. In a statement, López said it has been a “tremendous honor” to be a senator for nearly a decade and that he looks forward to finishing out his term that will include six more months of lawmaking during next year’s legislative session that runs from January to the end of June. López said he made the decision after taking his two daughters on a college tour through New England earlier this month and realizing he “didn’t want to miss another day” with them before they go to college. He said he plans to work full-time at the University of Delaware, where he is an extension specialist at the College of Agriculture.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: J. Thomas Manger, who has run large police departments in Maryland and Virginia, has been selected as chief of the U.S. Capitol Police in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which pro-Trump rioters stormed the building, disrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. Manger, who most recently served for 15 years as chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, was picked for the position following an extensive search, according to four people briefed on the matter. The people were not authorized to discuss the selection process publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The decision came as the Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies are struggling to determine the best way to secure the Capitol and what direction to take the 2,300-person force that guards the building and the lawmakers inside it and functions as mashup of a national security agency and local police department. The department has asked for more funding for more officers and better riot gear. In the meantime, the massive fence that encircled the grounds was taken down in the past few weeks. The Capitol Police Board, which includes the House and Senate sergeant at arms and the Architect of the Capitol, is charged with oversight of the police force and led the search.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart:An alligator attacked and seriously injured a man at a park Monday, officials said. The attack occurred shortly before noon at Halpatiokee Regional Park in Stuart, according to a Martin County Sheriff’s Office Facebook post. The man was riding a bicycle when he lost control and fell down an embankment toward a body of water, officials said. The female alligator measured at more than 8-feet long, weighing an estimated 170 pounds, and was captured by trapper John Davidson, who was called to the park. Davidson was able to capture the alligator quickly, he said, and believes it might have a nest nearby that prompted it to stay close to the area. The trapper planned to return to the park Tuesday to search for the eggs and safely relocate them. “You got to be careful when you’re around the water, especially this time of year” said Davidson, a retired firefighter who has been a trapper for about 10 years. “The females are sitting on nests and are particularly aggressive.” The alligator is being relocated to a farm near Fort Drum, Davidson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: A judge on Monday dismissed all charges against a man convicted of the 1985 slayings of a couple at a south Georgia church, exonerating him after he spent two decades behind bars, the man’s attorneys said. Glynn County Superior Court Judge Stephen Scarlett granted a motion by prosecutors to dismiss the case against Dennis Perry, 59. Scarlett last year gave Perry the chance for a new trial after DNA recovered from the crime scene matched a different suspect during reinvestigation of the case. He also ordered Perry’s release from prison while prosecutors decided whether to refile charges. Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Keith Higgins, who took office in January, decided not to pursue the case. Perry, who had maintained his innocence, said in a statement he “knew that eventually someone else would see the truth.” The Swains were killed inside Rising Daughters Baptist Church in Waverly, Georgia, in 1985. Perry was convicted in 2003 largely on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend’s mother, who said Perry had told her he planned to kill Harold Swain. The state didn’t disclose to the defense that the woman was paid $12,000 in reward money for her testimony. Perry received two consecutive life sentences in prison. The new DNA evidence has cast suspicion on another man in the slaying. Authorities were led to that suspect after reporting by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found his alibi was fabricated, Perry’s attorneys said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu restaurants and bars have the option to do away with social distancing if customers provide proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test. But many restaurant operators aren’t doing so because diners don’t want to show their vaccination cards or present test results, Hawaii New Now reported Monday. Honolulu allows eateries to participate in the program under Tier 5 of its COVID-19 pandemic reopening guidelines. Restaurants that did so encountered backlash. “In the beginning, we were so excited,” said Sheryl Matsuoka, the executive director of the Hawaii Restaurant Association. “It gave restaurants an option.” Matsuoka said she expected smaller restaurants to participate in the change. “But as time went by, we found guests didn’t want to show their card or weren’t vaccinated,” she said. “Visitors were upset because guests came from states with less restrictions.” Sarah Nguyen, owner of The Pizza Press in Pearl City, said she asked her employees about the program, and decided against it. “I wanted to respect each person’s privacy. It would be hard to manage and I didn’t want to put my staff in a position where a situation would arise,” Nguyen said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups have notified Gov. Brad Little and other state officials of their intent to file a lawsuit over an expanded wolf-killing law they believe will result in the illegal killing of federally protected grizzly bears and lynx. The Center for Biological Diversity, Western Watersheds Project and others on Monday gave a required 60-day notice of their intent to sue if Idaho officials don’t prohibit all hunting, trapping and snaring in grizzly bear and lynx habitat. For lynx, the conditions could cover most of Idaho except for the southwestern portion of the state. For grizzly bears, the areas would include portions of northern, central and eastern Idaho. Wolves are found in roughly the northern two-thirds of the state. In May, the Republican governor signed into law a measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves through expanded trapping and hunting. It took effect July 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nBath:A central Illinois fishing tournament that was canceled two years ago because the Illinois River flooded and last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic is returning next month. The Redneck Fishing Tournament held in Bath along the river for about a decade is gain on the calendar, with this year’s event set for Aug. 6-7. “We’re back, and the fish had better look out,” event organizer Betty DeFord told the ( Peoria) Journal Star. The event will also include bands, a beer garden, raffles and food vendors, with the proceeds going to veterans organizations. Admission is $3 for the day and $5 for the weekend. The tournament is one of the more creative responses to the invasion of the Illinois River by Asian carp – a fish that overwhelms natural ecosystems and is known for jumping out of the water high into the air. The tournament is noteworthy for another reason: Fishing poles are not used. Instead, competitors either use nets to catch the fish as they leap into the air or collect them as they land inside their boats. Previous winners have caught hundreds of the fish in just a couple hours.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Indiana University can require its roughly 90,000 students and 40,000 employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations under a federal judge’s ruling that might be the first of its kind regarding college immunization mandates. In a ruling dated Sunday, U.S. District Judge Damon Leichty in South Bend rejected a request from eight IU students who sought to block the requirement while they pursue a lawsuit claiming that the university’s policy violated their constitutional rights by forcing them to receive unwanted medical treatment. James Bopp, an attorney representing the students, said he plans to appeal the ruling, which he believes is the first by a federal judge in challenges to such mandates, which have been imposed by hundreds of U.S. public and private colleges. Leichty wrote that the students haven’t presented evidence showing they could prevail in the case, and that the Constitution “permits Indiana University to pursue a reasonable and due process of vaccination in the legitimate interest of public health for its students, faculty and staff.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Des Moines will no longer consider doubling the funding for a private security firm after a newspaper investigation revealed its top official had referred to local racial justice protests as “terrorism” and made denigrating remarks about Black activists. The move came after a Des Moines Register investigation into comments by Tom Conley, president and CEO of the Des Moines-based Conley Group, in emails to city officials and on his Facebook page. City manager Scott Sanders said he had instructed the city clerk to remove from Monday’s City Council agenda a proposal to allocate $550,000 for the firm’s services, more than doubling the contract signed in October, the Des Moines Register reported. Sanders said although the city is satisfied with the professionalism of the firm’s services, the comments must be “properly investigated.” The firm provides security services for several municipal and school buildings. Conley stood by his opinion that last summer’s protests should be considered terrorism. “If somebody doesn’t want to do business with me because of my opinions, then don’t … I’m just a candid individual, Conley said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The health department in Kansas’ most populous county urged its public schools Monday to require students and staff who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors when classes resume for the fall. The Johnson County Department of Health and Environment’s guidance came with confirmed cases of the faster-spreading delta variant continuing to rise across Kansas and fueling larger numbers of new COVID-19 cases overall. “We want a return to normalcy, but we need to be cautious and get vaccinated if eligible.” said Dr. Sanmi Areola, the department’s director. Lance Williamson, a registered nurse and infection prevention consultant for the University of Kansas Health System, said wearing masks is a “basic precaution” against COVID-19. The state reported Monday that confirmed delta variant cases increased by 20% since Friday, up 158 to 950. Confirming variant cases requires genetic testing of patients’ nasal swabs or saliva samples. State data also showed that Kansas averaged 440 new COVID-19 cases overall for the seven days ending Monday, the highest such average since Feb. 26.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Gov. Andy Beshear urged front-line workers dealing with the public to wear masks, even if fully vaccinated against COVID-19, because of risks from the more infectious delta variant blamed for sparking an increase in coronavirus cases. With large swaths of Kentucky still showing lagging vaccination rates, Beshear offered mask-wearing recommendations to protect Kentuckians from the threat posed by the variant. Beshear continued to implore unvaccinated Kentuckians to get the shots. The COVID-19 vaccines offer “significant protection” against serious illness and death, including from the delta variant, he said, adding: “This is all it would take to protect America, if folks would do it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Lawmakers entered uncharted territory Tuesday, holding their first veto override session under the nearly 50-year-old state constitution, with uncertainty about whether they will have the votes to overturn bill rejections or what the rules of engagement are. The majority-Republican House and Senate decided to return to the Capitol largely because of two bills rejected by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards: a measure banning transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender, and legislation allowing people 21 and older to carry a concealed handgun without needing a permit and safety training. But they also can consider other measures that Edwards rejected, such as his removal of specific projects from budget bills, or legislation that sought to ban coronavirus vaccine mandates, mandated regular audits of elections and required local school systems to publish their finances in the Louisiana Checkbook online site.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Voters could make Maine the first state in the U.S. to decide to amend the state constitution to establish growing and consuming food as a constitutional right. The proposal will be added to the Nov. 2 ballot, the Portland Press Herald reported. Efforts to establish food rights is an evolution of the movement that produced the Maine Food Sovereignty Act. The act authorized cities in Maine to adopt local food ordinances. “You have to have a right to food because food is life,” said Sen. Craig Hickman, a farmer and a supporter of the potential amendment. Critics of the amendment said it could have unforeseen consequences for food safety and animal welfare as judges interpret the amendment in future court cases. The bill was approved by a majority in the House and Senate and will not require the approval of Gov. Janet Mills before it goes directly to the ballot, the newspaper said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: State Sen. Paul Corderman, R-Washington, filed Monday to run for his District 2 seat in the 2022 Republican primary election. Corderman was appointed to the seat after former Sen. Andrew Serafini retired last summer. At that time, Corderman served in the House of Delegates from District 2B, which roughly includes the city limits of Hagerstown. He was appointed to that seat late in 2017 when former Del. Brett Wilson, R-Washington, was appointed as a judge in the Washington County Circuit Court. Corderman, who had served on the Hagerstown City Council, was then elected to return to the delegate seat in 2018.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A popular tourist town on Cape Cod issued a new mask-wearing advisory Monday after more than 100 people tested positive for the coronavirus following the Fourth of July holiday. The public health advisory from Provincetown officials encouraged residents and visitors to the town, a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination, to resume wearing masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status. It also urged crowded venues and other businesses where social distancing isn’t possible to verify that patrons are vaccinated. The advisory was approved during an emergency meeting with the town’s select board and board of health. Dr. Catherine Brown, of the state Department of Public Health, said the state has alerted other jurisdictions about the cluster of cases tied to Provincetown. Local officials said the majority are Massachusetts residents but more than 40 are from out of state. They said more 90% of those infected were men and that their median age is 35. Officials said they’re also investigating how many of those infected were already vaccinated.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: Students fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at Central Michigan University can enter to win full-year scholarships and hundreds of gift cards, the university announced Monday. The university will name winners Aug. 2 and Aug. 23, Sept. 13, and Oct. 4. Each drawing will have 100 students who will get a $75 gift card and one student who will win full-year scholarship equal to 30 domestic undergraduate credit hours or 18 domestic graduate credit hours to be used for the 2021-2022 school year. In the announcement from the university it cited a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where only 34% of adults ages 18 to 39 have received a COVID-19 vaccine. All participating students will receive a 20% discount at the university bookstore in an effort to get students vaccinated before the fall semester starts, said Jennifer DeHaemers, vice president for student recruitment and retention.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An invasive weed that can choke out native plants and fish habitat has been found in one of Minnesota’s largest and most popular walleye lakes, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said. The DNR has confirmed the discovery of starry stonewort in Leech Lake, located in northwestern Minnesota. The bright green microalgae plant has now been verified in 18 of the state’s 11.842 lakes, according to the DNR, including nearby Cass Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish. Leech Lake is largely within the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reservation boundaries. It is one of the 10 largest lakes in Minnesota with nearly 200 miles of shoreline, area tourism officials said. Starry stonewort has never been eradicated from any U.S. lake, but early detection is the key to effective management, the DNR said. It is most likely spread when fragments have not been properly cleaned from trailered boats, personal watercraft, docks, boat lifts, anchors or other water-related equipment. The species was first discovered in Minnesota in 2015 in Lake Koronis, which is located near Paynesville in Stearns County. The state has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to fight the weed.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s top public health official, said the state is seeing a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in July. The State Department of Health said 2,326 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed Friday through Sunday. That is largest three-day increase of cases reported in the state since February. As of Monday, the Health Department said Mississippi has had 329,130 confirmed cases of the virus since the start of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. The department said 7,468 people in the state had died from the virus. Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and the increase of cases is happening as schools prepare for the new academic year. Classes begin July 26 in the northern Mississippi city of Corinth and in early to mid-August in most other districts. The state Board of Education on Thursday adopted policies requiring all school districts to restart in-person learning as the main form of instruction for 2021-22. During the previous year, districts had the option for in-person or online instruction, or a combination of the two.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Kansas City Chiefs fans will have to get tickets in advance to visit the team’s training camp this year, and they won’t be able to get autographs from players because of the pandemic. Dr. Paul Schroeppel, the AFC champions’ head orthopedic surgeon, said fans won’t be allowed to interact with players under the NFL’s protocols for preventing coronavirus outbreaks. He discussed the rules during a daily webcast by the University of Kansas Health System. The Chiefs open their training camp in St. Joseph, Missouri, on July 28 with a special event for season ticket holders, with practices open to other fans July 29, with attendance limited. Missouri has seen a surge in new COVID-19 cases because of the faster-spreading delta variant.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Environmental groups are challenging the Montana Department of Environmental Quality for permitting wastewater disposal into the groundwater for a new development in Big Sky that they said could degrade water quality in the Gallatin River downstream from Yellowstone National Park. The Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Montana Environmental Information Center filed Friday a complaint in Gallatin County court over the department’s May decision to approve a groundwater pollution permit for a septic system owned by Lazy J South, a residential and commercial development less than half a mile from the Gallatin River. The groups said the permit could lead to increased algal blooms in the river, which is suffering from unprecedented noxious algal blooms downstream from Big Sky. Such blooms could harm recreational activities on the river, including trout fishing and whitewater rafting, according to the court filing. A spokesperson for DEQ said the department does not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska schools are getting conflicting advice from state and federal health officials over whether students should quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus. The Omaha World-Herald reported the state Department of Health and Human Services is telling schools that students who had contact with an infected person would not have to quarantine as long as they don’t have any symptoms. If symptoms develop, then the state said a student should isolate themselves. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said students who aren’t vaccinated and have close contact with an infected person should still quarantine. The CDC said vaccinated people who are showing no symptoms are not required to quarantine after a contact. Each school district will be left to decide which advice to follow after consulting with local health officials. The Nebraska State Education Association said it is urging school districts to follow the CDC guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada-based scientists argued in a new study that wildfire smoke might increase the risk of contracting the coronavirus. A study published last week by scientists at the Desert Research Institute found that coronavirus infection rates increased disproportionately during wildfire season in 2020, when smoke from fires in neighboring states blanketed much of northern Nevada. In a paper in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, Desert Research Institute Assistant Research Scientist Daniel Kiser and four co-authors noted the test positivity rate in Washoe County increased significantly during periods when monitors measured high levels of particulate matter in the air from wildfire smoke. For every 10 micrograms per cubic meter of small particulate matter known as PM2.5 in the air, the positivity rate increased about 6.3% two to six days later, the study found. The authors argued that the association between wildfire smoke and the coronavirus likely suggested pollution made people more prone to viruses more broadly.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Applications are being accepted for New Hampshire’s “Summer Stipend Program,” which seeks to reward workers returning to jobs after unemployment. The state announced in May that it was ending federal pandemic unemployment benefits. Anyone who was on unemployment the week of May 15 and has since kept a job for at least eight weeks can now apply for the stipends, which are $500 for part-time workers and $1,000 for full-time employees. More than 1,700 individuals who found work between May 18-22 became eligible to apply on Monday. The program will remain active until the $10 million fund is depleted. Since the stipend was announced, more than 21,000 people have stopped filing for unemployment benefits, according to Gov. Chris Sununu’s office.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The 18-year old pilot of a banner plane made an emergency landing Monday on a bridge in southern New Jersey, snarling traffic but causing no injuries, authorities said. Landon Lucas reported that his plane started having engine trouble about 12:30 p.m. as he was flying near Steel Pier in Atlantic City, officials said. Lucas released his banner into the ocean and was trying to fly to a nearby municipal airport in Ocean City when he spotted a gap in traffic in the westbound lanes of the Route 52 causeway, which connects Ocean City and Somers Point. Lucas landed the plane without incident, witnesses said, and officials said the aircraft was not damaged. The incident remains under investigation, authorities said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Film Office said this fiscal year, which began in July 2020 during the pandemic, broke records in the state with film and TV productions spending roughly $623 million. An estimated 40% of production budgets are spent on procuring goods and services from New Mexico businesses, according to the state. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham touted the numbers, saying the productions would otherwise have been shot elsewhere had it not been for the state’s crew base, stunning locations and film incentive program. Earlier this year, NBCUniversal marked the opening of its production hub near downtown Albuquerque. It joined Netflix, which has plans to expand its footprint on the southern edge of the city. Both have received millions of dollars in state and local economic development funds as incentives for locating in New Mexico. An estimated 9,000 New Mexico residents work in the industry with an average wage of more than $56,000 annually, according to the state. About three-quarters of below-the-line crew and cast members involved in productions over the last year were residents.\n\nNew York\n\nWatertown: Lawmakers in Watertown voted to keep retail marijuana shops from opening in the northern New York city. The city council opted Watertown out of New York’s new marijuana legalization law after a marathon public hearing Monday night, according to WWNY-TV. New York approved a legalization bill in March that will allow sales of recreational-use cannabis. Sales are expected to begin next year. But the state law allows local governments to pass stricter rules on marijuana use and to prohibit retail dispensaries. Twenty-six people spoke at the hearing, most in favor of opting into the state law. “I’m asking, why wouldn’t you want to keep all of your city residents who do smoke marijuana, give them a safe place to buy marijuana, where it’s controlled?” Joanne Hughes said. Council members said they wanted more guidance from Albany and noted they could still opt back in later. Also, the public can petition the council to hold a referendum.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A nearly four-year project to repair the hull of the USS North Carolina battleship was officially completed Tuesday with water from the Cape Fear River flooding the temporary barrier surrounding the ship. A Wilmington-based company cut and replaced steel on the bow and also repainted affected areas of the hull, news outlet reported. The $11 million project began in August 2016 with the construction of a cofferdam to surround the battleship which allowed crews to drain the river water and have access to the ship’s brittle hull. With the cofferdam construction wrapping up in May 2018, work to replace the steel at the ship’s water-wind line began in June 2020. Atlantic Coast Industrial Marine Construction cut and replaced steel on the bow, as well as repainted affected areas of the hull, according to a release on the battleship’s website. Money for the repair came from fundraising effort to aid in restoration and maintenance of the battleship and its facilities. The battleship arrived in Wilmington in 1961 after serving in World War II. It has suffered from more than 50 years of corrosion from the Cape Fear River and plans to repair the ship’s hull have been on the table since at least 2010.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: With nearly half the cattle in North Dakota in extreme drought locations, ranchers are making some tough decisions on thinning their herds. At Kist Livestock Auction in Mandan, weekly sales are up by 1,000 head over a typical year, an increase of one-third. Some cattle stay in the state, said Matt Lachenmeier, the auction barn’s field representative. But there’s demand for cattle in nearby states, as well, including Minnesota. “Now we’re starting to run out of homes for them,” he said. “There’s a lot of cattle moving.” Lachenmeier said ranchers are selling replacement heifers or older cows first and trying to hang on to younger cows. He said it’s hard to lose animals that have been part of a long-term breeding program, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The span from October 2020 to March 2021 is the driest on record, said Janna Block, extension livestock systems specialist at North Dakota State University’s Hettinger research center.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A Columbus police helicopter crew that spelled out the department’s initials during an early morning patrol over a residential neighborhood committed no misconduct, an internal review determined. But the department’s flight rules will be updated to “remind” all helicopter crews not to loiter over residential areas without a clear law-enforcement purpose, The Columbus Dispatch reported Tuesday. The newspaper obtained the report through a public records request. The two-person crew said the maneuver wasn’t planned, but carried out after they noticed on a flight-tracking display they had unintentionally spelled out what resembled a “C” while on patrol April 17. The pilot decided to continue on to spell out a “P” and “D” while they awaited their next call for service. Officials have said the maneuver took about 10 minutes to complete, was done at normal altitude and didn’t result in any missed calls for service or additional fuel usage. It was conducted over a “random area of the city” that included some residential area, something which the report said was “not intentional.” Some city officials have criticized the officers’ actions, calling the incident “a joyride” and a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state is suing the U.S. Department of the Interior over the federal agency’s plan to strip Oklahoma of its jurisdiction to regulate coal mining on tribal reservations, Gov. Kevin Stitt said. The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Oklahoma City, names as defendants U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement and that agency’s acting director, Glenda Owens. The U.S. Department of the Interior notified the state earlier this year it planned to strip Oklahoma of its jurisdiction to regulate surface coal mining within the Muscogee Nation reservation following last year’s U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, which determined the tribe’s reservation in eastern Oklahoma was never disestablished by Congress. Stitt claims that the decision applies only to criminal jurisdiction.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The threat of thunderstorms and lightning has prompted officials in fire-ravaged Oregon to ask for help from outside the Pacific Northwest to prepare for additional blazes as many resources are already devoted to a massive fire in the state that has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island. The 537-square-mile blaze is burning 300 miles southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges. Evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California. But eyeing how the Oergon fire – fueled by extreme weather – keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there. The worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska. Thunderstorms could bring wind to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: City school officials are planning to consult with more air quality scientists after meeting Monday with an expert critical of the district’s $4.5 million purchase of NASA-originated air purifier technology. The expert, a Drexel professor, said the purifiers were ineffective at reducing the spread of the coronavirus and had the potential to create harmful chemicals. Preparing to welcome students in-person for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, district officials last week touted the multimillion-dollar investment in air purifiers advertised to rid air and surfaces of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The devices have been purchased and will be installed in every classroom by the end of July, a district spokesperson said. But following the school district’s announcement, several experts questioned the purifiers’ effectiveness and safety. They included Michael Waring – professor of indoor air quality and department head of civil, architectural, and environmental engineering at Drexel University – who met with School District Chief Operating Officer Reggie McNeil on Monday. According to a spokesperson, the district used federal funding to purchase more than 9,500 devices for its 200-plus buildings. They use ActivePure Technology, which, according to its website, protects against the coronavirus by pulling free oxygen and water molecules through a “patented honeycomb matrix” that oxidizes molecules that are then released back into a room to neutralize viruses.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Ten nonprofits from across Rhode Island will receive $10,000 in grants as the state reached the first milestone of its RI Gives Vax Challenge, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee said. The Democrat said 5,000 more Rhode Islanders received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. “This is a win-win for Rhode Island, our local nonprofits and the communities they serve,” McKee said. “Through the RI Gives Vax Challenge, we’re getting healthier, we’re raising awareness, and we’re able to help the organizations that have stepped up to support those most in need during the pandemic.” The recipients of the first round of grants were selected through a lottery system by the Rhode Island Foundation. They include Access To Recovery, Adoption Rhode Island, Boys & Girls Clubs of Northern Rhode Island, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, the Elisha Project, Pawtucket Soup Kitchen, the Refugee Development Center, the Rhode Island Free Clinic, Southern Rhode Island Volunteers, and the WARM Center. The fund has a budget of $750,000, which will be allocated in grants of $10,000 to a Rhode Island nonprofit each time the state administers an additional 5,000 first COVID-19 vaccine doses. The state provided $500,000 and the Rhode Island Foundation contributed $250,000.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The process to draw new districts for South Carolina House and Senate seats as well as the U.S. House kicked off Tuesday, with senators hopeful the whirlwind of map drawing, negotiations, public hearings and final vote will take less than four months. The Senate’s redistricting subcommittee agreed Tuesday at its first meeting to hold 10 public hearings across the state starting next week and ending before the final U.S. census data on where the 5.1 million people in South Carolina live is released Aug. 16. The districts are drawn every 10 years after the federal government completes its nationwide count. The goal of the high-stakes process is to make sure all 46 of the state’s Senate districts and 124 House districts have roughly the same number of people, give or take a few thousand.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said the state finished the last fiscal year with an $86 million surplus. Tax revenue hit a 30-year high, the Republican governor said, and finished $62 million over what was estimated. The state also spent about $24 million less than what was budgeted for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. Noem credited the state’s “respect for freedom and our continued emphasis on fiscal responsibility” for the financial windfall, though federal coronavirus relief funds sent to taxpayers and state government also fueled the surplus. The state government has received more than $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds – money that was pumped into businesses and used to cover state expenses tied to the pandemic.Noem has pointed to the state’s growing economy as evidence her mostly hands-off approach to the pandemic worked.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Volkswagen said it will stop producing the Passat at its Chattanooga assembly plant. The German-based automaker said it will stop building the sedan model in Chattanooga with a limited edition 2022 model. Volkswagen said the move is part of its transformation to build future electric vehicles. The company began making the Passat in Chattanooga in 2011. The first versions of the Volkswagen Passat family sedans and wagons for U.S. customers launched in 1974 under the Dasher name. The Passat name first appeared in the U.S. market in 1990 and has remained since. The company exported the first six generations from Europe.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi:Former Police Chief Mike Markle is returning to the top spot, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and City Manager Peter Zanoni said. Markle retired in May 2021 after more than 30 years of serving Corpus Christi. He previously accepted a private sector job. In June, interim chief and former assistant chief David Blackmon announced he would pull his name from consideration for the permanent chief position. Markle’s reappointment requires City Council confirmation. His first day back on the job will be July 27 if approved by the council.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Health officials have warned that algae blooms are turning up in Utah Lake that can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals. The Utah County Health Department warned that samples taken from the lake water on July 13 showed that cyanobacteria cell counts have reached a dangerous level, The Daily Herald reported Monday. The warning came days after officials issued a similar advisory for American Fork Beach. Utah Lake marinas will remain open for boat traffic but water recreation “should be avoided” at the American Fork Marina, Lincoln Beach and within the Provo Bay, according to county health officials. Cyanobacteria are microorganisms that are a natural part of fresh water ecosystems but under certain conditions they can multiple rapidly, creating scums and blooms on the water’s surface and along shorelines\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Health Department warned Tuesday that algae blooms are turning up in Vermont waters that can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals. The department is encouraging people to go to its website to view a video and photos of what cyanobacteria and blooms look like. “By knowing what a bloom looks like, and scanning the water before you go in, you’ll know if you should stay out of the water,” Bridget O’Brien, an environmental health scientist with the Department of Health, said in a statement. Cyanobacteria are microorganisms that are a natural part of fresh water ecosystems but under certain conditions they can multiple rapidly, creating scums and blooms on the water’s surface and along shorelines, the department said. Blooms have shown up most often in northern parts of Lake Champlain, causing some Burlington beaches to recently be closed, and in other regions of the lake as well as other Vermont lakes in recent years. The blooms can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, a sore throat, stomach problems and more serious health concerns for swimmers and waders, the Health Department said, noting that exposure is a particular concern for small children who might ingest the water. Cyanobacteria is potentially fatal to dogs who might drink the water or lick the residue off their fur, officials warned.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo is welcoming its first baby Southern white rhinoceros. The male calf was born to mom, Zina, and dad, Sibindi, on July 11, zoo officials announced Monday. He is strong, nursing well and is bonding with his mother, who is showing signs of good mothering, officials said. The calf is the first of his species to be born at the Virginia Zoo and his birth brings the zoo’s rhino count to four. The zoo’s veterinarian Dr. Tara Reilly examined the calf about 36 hours after he was born and he weighed in at 125 pounds. He is 22 inches tall and 36 inches long. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as near-threatened because of threats in the wild from habitat loss and illegal poaching of their horns. The new calf needs a name, so the zoo is auctioning off the right to name him. The auction runs through July 30 and proceeds will go to the International Rhino Foundation.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: United Airlines plans to suspend service out of Paine Field airport in Everett beginning in early October. In a statement Monday, a United spokesperson said the airline has “continued to evaluate and adapt its network” and that the decision is “based on demand trends.” The airline now operates one daily United Express flight between Denver International Airport and Paine Field, which will be discontinued beginning Oct. 5, according to the statement. The Seattle Times reported United said it will continue to serve the region with nonstop service to Seattle from Denver, New York/Newark, Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, the District of Columbia and San Francisco. John Gallagher, a spokesperson for Propeller Airports, which designed, built and operates the two-year-old terminal north of Seattle, said in a statement the move was not a surprise because “carriers are making post-pandemic adjustments to their schedules and markets.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: “America’s Got Talent” winner Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. is being featured on an adult literacy campaign in West Virginia. A photo of Murphy, a native of Logan, West Virginia, is on billboards throughout the state as part of the “Never Too Late to Graduate” push by the state Department of Education’s Office of Adult Education. Murphy also is displaying the materials and banners at his state concerts to provide information to help people earn their diplomas and pursue other educational opportunities, the department said. “I truly believe it is never too late to graduate, and I hope others use my story as an example of how to always have a goal and a dream,” Murphy said. Murphy dropped out of school in the 11th grade, a decision that haunted him for years. He worked numerous odd jobs and at one point was living out of his car. Last year during the coronavirus pandemic, the singer took online classes during the spring and summer after his road performances were eliminated by the virus shutdown. He earned his high school equivalency diploma 30 years after dropping out.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The University of Wisconsin Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine opened a new clinic Friday that will use the latest genetic technology, and exploit connections to top scientists around the world in order to help patients who have been at the mercy of unknown diseases. Stephen Meyn, who directs the Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine, said the new clinic represents an initial investment of several million dollars and is expected to take on about 100 cases a year “and ramp up from there.” The clinic has already “reviewed more than 50 cases with a wide range of conditions from birth defects to neurologic problems to skeletal disorders and immune system problems, Meyn said. The clinic, located in the Waisman Center, will partner with the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, the Biotechnology Center at UW-Madison, Stanford University in California and The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Meyn said that in addition to the clinic for patients, the project will also include research.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A judge has sentenced an Oklahoma man to a week in jail and ordered him to pay $1,100 for guiding visitors illegally in Yellowstone National Park. Theodore Eugene Garland, 60 of Edmond, Oklahoma, led visitors who trespassed in thermal areas and elsewhere, cliff-jumped in an off-limits area and altered a river’s flow by creating a pool for swimmers to soak in, U.S. prosecutors said in a statement Monday. Magistrate Judge Mark L. Carman in Mammoth Hot Springs found Garland guilty of the violations in a nonjury trial in April and sentenced him July 2. Besides imposing the jail time and payments, the judge banned Garland from the park for the remainder of 2021. Guiding in Yellowstone requires a permit. Garland had one but video he posted on Facebook of cliff-jumping in Firehole Canyon prompted a Yellowstone law enforcement ranger to investigate, according to court documents filed in the case. An Apple podcast, Instagram photo and Facebook video revealed other possible violations such as creating a “hot pot” for swimmers at the base of Mystic Falls on the Little Firehole River, ranger Devon Beeny said in the documents. Prosecutors charged Garland with 15 counts of illegal activities and violating park regulations. Carman found Garland guilty of seven, acquitting him of others that included disturbing a black bear while it was feeding.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/04/fur-seal-pups-big-balloon-fest-runaway-bull-news-around-states/40242775/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Gov. Kay Ivey said South Korean auto parts manufacturer Shinhwa Group is investing $42 million in a facility and will create 95 jobs in Auburn, the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States. Construction is already underway. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be finished by the summer. Shinhwa will initially make driveshafts for vehicles built by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing’s plant in Montgomery, as well as for Kia Motor Manufacturing’s plant, just across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said the company is a “welcome addition” to the state’s network of “high-caliber auto suppliers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern fur seals have declined at the world’s largest rookery in Alaska’s Pribilof Islands, but they’re thriving at an unlikely location. Numbers of fur seals continue to grow on Bogoslof Island, a tiny landmass at the tip of an active undersea volcano in the Aleutian Islands. The volcano two years ago spewed ash into the path of jetliners. Hot mud, steam and sulfurous gases continue to spit up from vents on the island. Fur seals give birth and raise pups along the beach of the island that’s only about one-third the size of New York City’s Central Park. Tom Gelatt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said biologists in 2015 estimated there were 28,000 pups on the island. He said the 2019 estimate likely will be more than 36,000 pups.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Game and Fish Department is investigating the poaching of a bull elk north of Heber in late August and is asking for the public’s help finding whoever killed the animal. The agency said Tuesday the poacher left the bull elk’s meat to waste west of Forest Road 153 near Point and Javelina water catchments. Agency officials said in a press release they believe someone has information about the case because the poaching incident occurred during a time when many hunters were scouting the area for upcoming hunts. Other recreationists are also believed to have been in the area at the time of the crime, the agency said. Hunting elk and other types of game in Arizona is regulated by the department. Hunters are required to draw permits, which are limited in number and allow them to hunt a limited number of game. Hunting can take place only in designated areas during designated periods. Most elk hunting takes place during the fall season in Arizona, although there are a few locations designated during other times of the year, according to the Game and Fish website. Anyone with information about the poaching incident should call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline at 800-352-0700 or visit www.azgfd.gov and refer to case #19-003199. Callers can remain anonymous upon request and might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 upon an arrest. The Arizona Elk Society and Arizona Deer Association are each offering an additional $2,500 reward upon the arrest and conviction of the poachers, according to a press release from the department.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The Saracen Casino Annex, the largest tourism investment project in Arkansas, opened Tuesday morning. The annex is part of the $350 million Saracen Casino Resort project owned and operated by the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation. The casino resort is expected to open next June. About 10,000 guests have visited the 300-slot-machine annex since Friday’s surprise “soft opening.” Quapaw Nation officials said they plan to employ 1,100 people permanently at the Saracen Casino Resort. More than 200 are employed at the annex and a new nearby convenience store and gas station. Most hires came from Pine Bluff. The project is expected to feature 2,000 slot machines and 50 gambling tables, along with a 300-room hotel with a fire safety and an emergency services facility.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents had a chance to see a mini-air show as the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team tours California. The team flew past the famed Hollywood sign Wednesday afternoon and headed south to the Port of Long Beach to fly over the retired British ocean liner Queen Mary, which is now a tourist attraction and hotel. On Tuesday, the Red Arrows’ jets flew over San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate bridge. This weekend, they will join the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds and other performers at the Great Pacific Airshow over the surf at Huntington Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A falcon that has served as the mascot for the U.S. Air Force Academy for the past 23 years has died. KCNC-TV reported the passing of the falcon named Aurora was announced by the academy on Wednesday. The academy said in a statement that the falcon was the longest-serving live mascot in the school’s 65-year history. Aurora was reported to have recovered after suffering injuries to its wings in November 2018 during a prank abduction before the annual football game against the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The Air Force Academy uses several falcons during home games and Aurora attended most road games to greet fans. The academy described her as a “feisty, spirited bird who commanded respect.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: The Pentagon said the USS Oregon, the Navy’s newest attack submarine, will be christened Saturday at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton. U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said he will attend as the keynote speaker. He said the submarine will be christened with water from Crater Lake and wine from Oregon. Oregon, a Virginia-class submarine, is the third U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. Virginia-class submarines are built to conduct anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operation forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. The Pentagon said they have stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island:State environmental officials might soon lease public parkland to an offshore wind energy company in exchange for millions of dollars in new amenities at Delaware’s southernmost beach. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with Ørsted, an offshore wind company based in Denmark, to discuss leasing up to 1.5 acres at Fenwick Island State Park. Ørsted would use park property to build an interconnection facility that will connect power generated by the yet-to-be-built Skipjack Wind Farm to the electrical grid. In exchange for leasing the public land, the company would fund improvements at the park, with the state now suggesting more than a dozen projects worth upward of $18 million. Those projects could include a two-level parking garage, a pedestrian overpass that allows foot traffic to cross Coastal Highway from the ocean side to the bayside, connections for a trail or sidewalk system, two additional bathrooms, an amphitheater and a new local Chamber of Commerce building that would house the park’s visitors center, a small nature center and more.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A museum dedicated to journalism and the First Amendment is set to close its doors near the National Mall by the end of the year. WTOP-FM reported the Newseum announced its impending closure Tuesday, citing yearslong financial issues. A company statement said that despite more than 11 years of service and nearly 10 million visitors, continued operations have proved to be unsustainable. The statement said the museum’s founder and primary funder, the Freedom Forum, remains committed to its mission to champion the five freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment. It said efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of a free press are needed now more than ever. Visitors are welcome through Dec. 31. Tickets purchased online include a 15% discount, with prices now starting at about $12.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan said Wednesday that he will be the majority investor in the nation’s only 24-hour news network aimed at African American viewers, giving the network a deep pocket as it launches next month. The network has been in the works for years and an announcement about its launch was made earlier this year. But Khan’s backing gives it a substantial boost. He declined to say how much he would invest initially but said it would be enough to keep the network running for a long time. Khan is worth an estimated $8 billion and made his fortune in the auto equipment industry. As well as the Jaguars, he owns Fulham Football Club of the English Football League, Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and All Elite Wrestling. Former Republican U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who was a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980s, will be chairman of the new network. It will be available via cable and satellite viewers in 33 million households. The network has agreements with Charter Communications, Comcast and DISH and will be carried in major African American markets such as New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles. The network is to begin broadcasting in November and will be based in Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, with bureaus across the country, Watts said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAdel: A hospital and nursing home in south Georgia has moved into a new $40 million facility. The Adel hospital began operating from its new home Tuesday. What had previously been Cook Medical Center is now called Southwell Medical. The 20-bed hospital, 95-bed nursing home and physicians’ offices are operated by Tift Regional Health System. Tift Regional Health System President Christopher Dorman told WALB-TV that the new complex just off Interstate 75 was renamed to help attract patients from beyond Cook County. The new hospital doesn’t have an emergency room but does have a walk-in clinic. The health system borrowed about 70% of construction costs through a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development loan. Cook County and Adel government agencies provided the remainder. The old hospital’s new use remains undetermined.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A post-mortem examination of two pygmy killer whales that were found stranded on a Maui beach suggested they were fighting an infection. The Maui News reported Wednesday that the adult males had inflamed lymph nodes when they stranded themselves at Sugar Beach last month. The infection was also found in pygmy killer whales that stranded themselves at the same beach in August. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the whales were afflicted elsewhere and there is no indication of an environmental toxin at Sugar Beach. The animals were euthanized after tests indicated little chance for survival at sea. Researchers said unusual food items, including excess plant material found in the animals, indicate they were not feeding normally.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge said she agrees that fulfilling public records requests can put a big burden on governmental resources, but she expressed skepticism about the number of completely redacted pages provided to four Boise-area journalists by Ada County officials this year. Fourth District Judge Deborah Bail made the comments during a hearing on a lawsuit between the Idaho Press Club and Ada County Commissioners on Wednesday afternoon. In the lawsuit the Idaho Press Club and the four journalists contend county officials repeatedly violated the state’s Public Records Act by wrongly denying access to some documents, over-redacting others and otherwise mishandling public information requests. In court Wednesday, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney James Dickinson said the judge has all the evidence she needs in the form of the unredacted documents. Dickinson said some of the redacted documents require context to understand why they should be kept from release but said he can’t discuss it in open court lest he reveal private protected information.\n\nIllinois\n\nFairview Heights: Planned Parenthood has quietly been building a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, as women concerned about the uncertain future of Missouri’s sole abortion clinic flock across the state line. The 18,000-square-foot in Fairview Heights, 12 miles east of St. Louis, will provide abortion services, as well as family planning, when it opens in mid-October, Planned Parenthood officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Planned Parenthood has been fighting Missouri’s health department for months to try and keep open its St. Louis clinic. The state has refused to renew its license to perform abortions, citing concerns that include “failed abortions” that required additional surgeries. Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission is deciding the fate of the St. Louis clinic. During an annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic in March, Missouri health investigators cited numerous concerns, including reports of failed abortions. Planned Parenthood said it has already addressed those concerns and defended its clinic. It claims the state is using the licensing process as an excuse to stop abortions.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: More than 2,200 sets of preserved fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of a late Indiana abortion doctor have been returned to Indiana. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Thursday that the fetal remains found last month at Dr. Ulrich Klopfer’s Will County, Illinois, home were transferred Wednesday to the St. Joseph County coroner’s office for “safekeeping.” Hill said at a news conference in South Bend that investigators determined the remains came from abortions performed in Indiana in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Authorities are still investigating where the abortions occurred. Klopfer performed abortions at clinics in Fort Wayne, South Bend and Gary. Relatives cleaning out Klopfer’s garage after his Sept. 3 death found the remains. Hill said they will be “given the decency of a burial that they deserve.”\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said it plans to collect as many deer samples in northeastern Iowa as it can this hunting season to test for chronic wasting disease after the first case in Dubuque County was confirmed in January, the Telegraph Herald reported Thursday. Chris Ensminger, the wildlife research section supervisor for the department, said officials want to collect at least 250 samples from an area in which the diseased deer was killed and at least 250 samples from elsewhere in Dubuque County. Samples also will be collected from surrounding eastern Iowa counties. The disease attacks the brains of deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have been recorded, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to not eat meat from infected animals. The disease has become increasingly prevalent in parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Nearly 400 of the 1,060 deer that tested positive for the disease in Wisconsin from April 2018 to the end of March were in Iowa County in southwest Wisconsin. Other cases came from surrounding Crawford, Grant and Lafayette counties.\n\nKansas\n\nLinwood: A plan to build a village of foster care homes in northeast Kansas has gotten the OK, although the project has been scaled down. The Kansas City Star reported that the nonprofit Joy Meadows initially sought to create a development with up to 10 homes that could house large sibling sets on a 23-acre property in the Linwood area. Instead, the Leavenworth County Commission voted Wednesday to limit the first phase of development to four total homes, including one that is located there. The nonprofit would be allowed to add three more in a future phase, upon review from the county. Foster care advocates and the Kansas Department for Children and Families voiced support for the residential development. But the project faced opposition from neighbors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLudlow:Fire and police units are at the scene of a barge accident that set several boats adrift or sinking in the Ohio River. The barge hit the Ludlow Bromley Yacht Club on Wednesday morning hard enough to partially submerge the marina’s bar and grill. Steve Hensley, Kenton County’s Director of Homeland Security and Management, told news outlets six boats were knocked loose. Hensley said there was one person on the barge and one person on one of the boats, but neither was injured. Officials said the restaurant and patio of the yacht club were heavily damaged with some of it attached to the barge that struck it. Ludlow Police Chief Scott Smith said the Coast Guard is investigating and the barge operator was being questioned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGonzales: The federal government has bought out an entire flood-prone neighborhood in Louisiana, prompting all its residents to move to higher ground. News outlets reported the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program financed the buyouts on along Silverleaf Street in Gonzales, which was carved out of a wetland in the 1980s and has frequently flooded since. Chief city engineer Jackie Baumann said the federal agency is buying the homes at preflood market value, and Restore Louisiana is offering to make up shortfalls in the purchasing price for some residents, as long as their next home isn’t in a flood zone. The 2017 offer required all 41 residents to agree to the deal, and the last resident agreed last month, enabling the government to restore the wetland.\n\nMaine\n\nLubec: American fishermen are expected to get a little more fishing quota under terms of an agreement with Canada. The countries are home to fisheries for economically important species that cross international boundaries, such as cod and haddock. They reach an agreement every year about how to divide catch on eastern Georges Bank, a crucial fishing area off New England and Canada. The New England Fishery Management Council said the U.S is scheduled to get 29% of the 1.4 million-pound total allowable catch of cod on eastern Georges Bank in 2020. It’s also set for 54% of the 66 million-pound total allowable catch of haddock in the area. The figures are subject to federal approval. They represent a 2.6 million-pound bump for haddock and about the same figure for cod compared to 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 1,600-pound bull escaped from a truck into the streets of Baltimore for several hours. The Baltimore Sun reported that it took three tranquilizer shots and a crew of zoo officials to recapture the animal on Wednesday. The purebred Angus breeding bull broke out of a truck while it was stopped at a red light. A crowd gathered and watched as the animal was corralled. Baltimore Police spokeswoman Det. Nicole Monroe told the newspaper that the “owner of the bull said he doesn’t have the best disposition.” The bull was from Hedgeapple Farm in Buckeystown. Executive director Scott Barao said the animal was very expensive and thanked the police for not shooting it. He said the bull is “extremely valuable to us and we’re just glad to have him alive.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: State wildlife officials said a moose that was struck by two cars and had a broken leg has been euthanized. Marion Larson, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, told The Boston Globe that Worcester police were called about a bull moose that was hit by a car Monday morning and Monday night. The moose was spotted in a pond Tuesday morning, and the state Environmental Police responded to the scene. Several boats were deployed so the moose did not approach Interstate 290, and to maneuver the animal into a suitable darting area. Larson said the 3 ½-year-old moose would not have survived its injuries. Another moose spotted in a Worcester cemetery Monday was tranquilized and freed at a state park.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek:A fourth Michigan resident has died from a rare mosquito-borne virus that has been recorded across the southern half of the state. WWMT-TV reported that 79-year-old Stan Zalner of Battle Creek died Wednesday after contracting eastern equine encephalitis. Ronna Bagent told the television station that her father was hospitalized in September with severe flu-like symptoms before doctors were able to confirm the illness through blood tests. Nine cases have been confirmed in six southern or southwestern Michigan counties. More than 30 animals – including 18 horses – in more than a dozen counties also have died from the disease. State health officials say low-flying aircraft were expected to spray pesticides Wednesday in Calhoun and 10 other counties. The pesticides kill adult mosquitoes on contact.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has rejected challenges by several environmental groups to a land swap needed for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the four lawsuits late Monday, ruling that the groups lacked the necessary legal standing to block the land exchange between PolyMet and the federal government. She said the groups couldn’t establish that they had been harmed. PolyMet traded 6,650 acres of federal land in the Superior National Forest at the mine site near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes for a similar amount of private land last year. Several environmental groups sued to challenge various aspects of the deal, saying it undervalued the federal land and violated other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. PolyMet disputed those claims and persuaded the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Ericksen dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice, meaning the groups could refile them at some later point. They could also appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:At least 22 soldiers training at Champ Shelby were injured during a night parachuting exercise. U.S. Army spokesman John Pennell told WDAM-TV that at least 15 people were treated by medics and another seven were hospitalized. Staff Sgt. John Healy said none of the injuries is considered to be life-threatening. Camp Shelby Cmdr. Col. Bobby Ginn said the troopers belong to the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Pennell said about 89 paratroopers were on the plane for the Wednesday night exercise. Ginn said the soldiers jumped from a C-130 aircraft and were blown off-course from their intended landing zone and into a group of pine trees. Several were entangled in the trees and had to be rescued. Healy says about 650 soldiers were involved in the exercise. About 3,000 troops from the Alaska base are at monthlong training at Camp Shelby called “Operation Arctic Anvil.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A compromise has been reached after Kansas City-area defense attorneys complained that their underwire bras were setting off jail metal detectors, forcing them to remove their lingerie for screening if they wanted to meet with their clients face-to-face. KCUR reported that the solution reached last month allows attorneys who set off metal detectors at the Jackson County Jail to be wanded or patted down. Attorneys protested after the jail rolled out a new security protocol in May. Jail officials initially responded by offering to allow attorneys to have noncontact visits, in which they talked to their clients by phones separated by glass, without clearing metal detectors first. But attorneys continued to push for change. Attorney Tracy Spradlin said she is thankful the issue was resolved without a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has announced plans to build a larger veterans affairs clinic in Missoula. The Missoulian reported that Tester, Democrat, announced Tuesday a location was chosen for a new community-based outpatient clinic. Officials said the clinic will be three times larger than the current clinic, which serves more than 6,000 veterans. It will have expanded primary care, mental health and specialty services. Tester said the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act that passed in 2017 set aside about $7 million in federal funding for the project. The clinic is expected to open in 2022. The current clinic will continue to serve patients until the new clinic opens.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bobcat that wandered into a Lincoln building has been captured and released back into the wild. Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs campus in south Lincoln called the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission on Tuesday to report the animal had been spotted inside one of its buildings. Commission staffers set a cage trap and baited it with raw fish. The estimated 20-pound bobcat bit on the bait and was caught. It was freed outside of town Wednesday. Bobcats are common in Nebraska and can be found at the edge of Lincoln, sometimes coming inside to hunt. Sam Wilson with the commission said bobcats are common but rarely seen.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A firefighter suffered burns and a woman was hospitalized after she jumped from a second-floor window at a motel that was on fire just east of downtown Reno. Police closed part of East Fourth Street for about three hours Tuesday afternoon before firefighters knocked down the blaze at the Lucky Motel. Fire officials told KRNV-TV the blaze destroyed two units at the weekly motel. One firefighter was being treated for burns to his leg. The woman was transported to a local hospital after she jumped from the window onto a car. She also suffered smoke inhalation. There was no immediate information available on their conditions Wednesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Reno Fire Department chaplain and motel owner were working to relocate displaced residents to a nearby motel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: A young moose that got stuck in a swimming pool has been successfully coaxed out. New Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists and conservation officers were called to a Bedford home Tuesday to help remove the young bull. He was in the water for several hours. Officers said he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps. The department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and coaxed him out. He scampered away. Col. Kevin Jordan suggested it had to do with it being moose breeding season. He told television station WMUR that “the younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nForked River: The state has created an oversight panel to evaluate the process of dismantling the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant. Gov. Phil Murphy said it will ensure the “proper protocols” are in place throughout the process. Oyster Creek is being decommissioned after it was permanently shuttered in September 2018. Its spent fuel is also being put into safe storage. The panel’s formation was announced Wednesday. It plans to meet at least twice a year and will allow the public to share their concerns. Its members include the state’s Environmental Protection Commissioner, state police superintendent, homeland security director and the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Oyster Creek is located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia. It produced enough electricity each year to supply about 600,000 typical homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons will lift off from the New Mexico desert over nine days as part of one of the world’s largest festivals dedicated to the sport of ballooning. In its 48th year, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled to kick off Saturday with a mass ascension. More than 580 balloons are registered, 17 countries are represented and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world are expected to turn out for the opening weekend. Albuquerque has played host to the fiesta since its inception in 1972. Troy Bradley, one of the ballooning world’s most prolific record-setters, said, “There’s just nothing like it in the world, to see that much color going into the sky.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Homeowners hurt by record flooding along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have until the end of this month to seek state funding. People living in Cayuga, Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence and Wayne counties can apply for up to $50,000 to offset damages sustained this year to their primary residences. The window for applications opened Tuesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said $20 million is available through the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Flood Relief and Recovery Program.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville:State health officials said 116 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaire’s disease since an outbreak was reported in September. The Asheville Citizen Times reported the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released the figures Wednesday, adding that there was one death. The department also said 65% of those diagnosed had to be hospitalized. DHHS expected the number of confirmed cases to continue to climb as diagnostic tests are processed. Health officials aren’t sure if the illness originated from last month’s Mountain State Fair. Legionnaires’ disease is bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill has released produced water into a small creek and a stock pond in western North Dakota. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the spill, which happened Tuesday in Dunn County. The pipeline is part of a gathering system operated by Marathon Oil. The spill happened about 1.5 miles northeast of Manning. Authorities don’t know what caused the leak. An estimated 21,000 gallons of produced water were released, impacting the creek and stock pond within pastureland. The creek discharges into the Knife River, but no impacts have been detected in the river. Produced water is a by-product of oil and gas development. State inspectors are checking the site and will continue to monitor the investigation and remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: An investigation into alleged hazing by a fraternity at Miami University has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members. A student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation. The student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported Oxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury’s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school’s Code of Student Conduct. Delta Tau Delta’s national headquarters revoked the chapter’s charter in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some of the 44 death row inmates housed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester will soon be moved from the prison’s maximum-security H-Unit to another unit to give them more benefits and access to the outdoors, the state’s new prisons boss said. In a letter released by the agency on Thursday, the Department of Corrections’ Interim Executive Director Scott Crow told officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma that the agency plans to move “qualifying inmates” to its less restrictive A-Unit by the end of October. The ACLU had threatened legal action over what it said are potential constitutional violations of the rights of death row inmates, mostly by confining them to their cells for 23 hours per day. Crow said the agency also plans to begin “contact” visitation for some of the moved death row inmates, who are allowed only noncontact visits behind Plexiglas and over a telephone.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The City Council has agreed to discuss whether to impose a ban on feeding deer and elk that wander city streets. KTVZ-TV reported councilmember Chris Piper, who with Bruce Abernethy proposed considering such a ban Wednesday, said the plans were brought to him and other councilmembers by neighborhood associations. Piper said dozens of collisions involving vehicles and deer were reported in the city last year. Piper said cities including Sunriver and Sisters have seen positive results from similar wildlife feeding regulations. There is a similar ban on feeding geese in Bend that can result in a $372 fine. Although that ban is isolated to Mirror Pond, the potential deer and elk feeding ban would be citywide.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Another alligator has turned up in Pittsburgh, the seventh this year. George DeSavage told WTAE-TV he and his girlfriend spotted it along the Allegheny River as the sun was setting on Tuesday. He said he grabbed it and it “went kind of limp and calm.” He said it seemed like it was handled by somebody. Police took it to Humane Animal Rescue, which named the gator Gus. The shelter shared photos on its Facebook page. The shelter believes the reptile was a pet. It’s not illegal to own an alligator in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s high school students scored significantly lower on the SAT than the national averages. The Providence Journal reported Thursday that the state’s Class of 2019 scored an average of 483 points on the English portion of the standardized college entrance exam; the national average was 531. On the math section of the test, Rhode Islanders scored an average of 474; the national average was 528. The numbers also showed a gap between white students and students of color, with white students scoring about 70 points higher in English and math. The Rhode Island Department of Education said SAT scores were flat statewide. State Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on district leaders to develop action plans to increase test participation and overall scores.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A man who set a fire at a Walmart to divert attention as he stole a case of beer has been sentenced to the maximum of 15 years in prison. Solicitor David Stumbo said 34-year-old Russell Geddings pleaded guilty Tuesday to third-degree arson – the same day his trial was set to start. Stumbo said Geddings set a clothes rack on fire at a Greenwood Walmart on Dec. 5 then stole the beer in the chaos. Stumbo said in a statement no one was injured, but $1.2 million worth of damage was done to the store and merchandise. Stumbo said Geddings deserved the maximum sentence for putting so many people at risk to steal beer. Geddings’ attorneys did not answer an email from a reporter seeking comment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A Delta commercial airplane made an emergency landing in Sioux Falls on Thursday morning for a passenger who had a medical emergency, officials said. The Delta flight, scheduled around 7:30 a.m. from Chicago to Seattle, was diverted when a 63-year-old male passenger started to experience emergency medical symptoms, said Dan Letellier, executive director for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. The flight was over Pierre when its pilots diverted to Sioux Falls, he said. The airplane landed around 8:30 a.m. and the passenger was transported to a local hospital, Letellier said. The passenger was alert and conscious, but Letellier didn’t comment any further on the man’s condition. “Based on our location in the country, there are thousands of flights that go overhead each year,” Letellier said. “We get at least one or two medical diversions a month. It’s a matter of where we fit in the country.”\n\nTennessee\n\nCollierville:Dozens gathered Tuesday to welcome home fallen soldier Maj. Trevor Joseph. The 33-year-old died Sept. 26 in an aviation accident at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He is survived by his wife, Erin. “Trevor was the greatest individual who was truly just so humble,” family members said in a text. “He would be so embarrassed by all this heroic attention, but this is exactly what he deserves.” Funeral arrangements are pending. Joseph, a soldier from the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk’s 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment, was killed during a JRTC rotation in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter within the training area, according to a Facebook post from JRTC and Fort Polk. Three other 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment soldiers were injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A truck driver from California was killed Wednesday when his semi crashed into an overpass support column on Interstate 10 in downtown El Paso. The fatal crash closed westbound lanes for several hours Wednesday morning. Harjot Singh Goraya, 32, of Riverside, California, was driving when he veered off the road and crashed into a support column shortly before 1 a.m. by the Mesa Street exit ramp. Traffic Police said that the road was wet from an earlier rainstorm but that the Special Traffic Investigations Unit has yet to determine how the driver lost control. The crash closed all westbound lanes early Wednesday. Drivers were urged to find alternative routes into downtown or West El Paso, including Paisano Drive, Montana Avenue and Trans Mountain Road. Traffic was directed off the highway at the downtown exit, police said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Health has confirmed the state’s first human death from West Nile virus this yer. Authorities said Saturday that a central Utah resident at least 65 years old died from the disease carried by mosquitoes sometime between Sept. 21 and Sept. 28. Information about the victim including name and gender have not been released. Utah health officials have confirmed 19 human cases West Nile virus this year. The total is higher than last year, when 11 residents contracted the virus and one person died. State health officials have said a wet spring this year created more standing water habitats for mosquitoes, attracting species that can transmit West Nile virus to Utah. Symptoms include headaches, joint pains and a high fever.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Residents of a town along the route of the Appalachian Trail have taken the first steps toward filing an application to become a designated Appalachian Trail Community. Local and county officials in Bennington met with state counterparts and community organizers recently to discuss plans to apply for the designation. Officials said the label as an Appalachian Trail Community will bring greater publicity and boost local business. The Appalachian Trail stretches about 2,200 miles, through 14 states and 40 communities. More than 100 miles of the trail runs through Vermont and a portion of it is just east of Bennington. The Bennington Banner reported that in addition to publicity, the move could bring stakeholders together to improve the trail system locally for hikers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A popular nature center will soon be closing temporarily for a $2.3 million renovation. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Maymont’s Robins Nature & Visitor Center will close Nov. 1 and open in March. The center houses fish, turtles, otters and other animals found within the James River and Chesapeake Bay. It attracts roughly 45,000 people each year. The animals will have upgraded habitats with lighting and heating systems and will be more visible to guests when the center reopens.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A late cold snap last winter has cut the production of Washington apricots in half. The Washington State Fruit Commission said the state usually produces 5,000 tons of apricots a year. But The Spokesman-Review reported that the yield this year is only about 2,500 tons. Washington produces about 20% of the nation’s apricots. The commission said frost in February, when apricot trees had bloomed, hurt production. Apricots produced in Washington are shipped across the country.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal officials said drought conditions in West Virginia are worsening as unusually high heat continues to beat down on the region. The U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed large swaths of southern West Virginia in a severe drought, a designation that includes the likely loss of crops and water shortages. The map also classified the entire northern part of the state as abnormally dry. Officials said nearly 50% of the state’s population is now in a drought. The National Weather Service marked last month as one of warmest and driest Septembers on record in multiple West Virginia cities. Less than 1 inch of rain was recorded in the month. Temperatures measured on Oct. 1 also surpassed record highs for the month in five cities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn’t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model. Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo that it’s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds. Perdue’s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and international trade wars. Wisconsin, which touts itself as America’s Dairyland on its license plates, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The Legislature’s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental health problems.\n\nWyoming", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/04"}]}

The tariffs will take effect June 1, which would give the two sides time to resume trade negotiations that broke off last week without reaching a new deal.\n\nAt the White House, Trump told reporters he was fine with China taking some retaliatory action as long as it doesn't breach an unspecified level. Trump insisted the U.S. will be taking in \"tens of billions of dollars\" from tariffs, although economists say the costs will be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\n“I love the position we’re in,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I think it’s working out really well.”\n\nTrump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the annual G-20 gathering of global leaders in Japan this June.\n\nChina said it was levying the tariffs because of Trump's decision to raise duties on Chinese products \"contrary to the consensus between China and the United States on resolving trade differences through consultations.\" The U.S.'s actions are \"jeopardizing the interests of both sides and not meeting the general expectations of the international community,\" China said.\n\nThe tariffs will impact a wide range of U.S. products, including coffee, beef, salmon, flowers and some fruits and vegetables.\n\nMore:Trump will meet with China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin during G-20\n\nStocks tumbled following China's announcement.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 600 points, or 2.3%, and closed at 25,324, its biggest one-day loss since January.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nCailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said she still expects the U.S. and China to reach a limited trade agreement in the next month or so because of the serious economic ramifications both countries will be dealing with otherwise.\n\n“However, a cooling-off period may be necessary to allow each party to save face, before meaningful progress can be made,” she said. “And without a doubt, the risk that a deal will fail to materialize has risen considerably, now that trust has been eroded on both sides.”\n\nChina's retaliatory tariffs are an extension of its previous strategy, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit policy group.\n\n\"At every point they have matched, but not exceeded, a U.S. tariff move,\" Holtz-Eakin said. \"This represents additional tariffs on items already facing duties — just as are the tariffs that President Trump announced last week. Stepping back, they are evidence of an escalating and increasingly troubling trade war.”\n\nThe Chinese announced the tariffs shortly after Trump warned them not to take any action and urged President Xi to sign a new trade deal.\n\n\"I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries,\" Trump tweeted early Monday.\n\n\"Too expensive to buy in China,” he added. “You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!\"\n\nTrade talks between the two countries stalled Friday without a new deal after Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, including office furniture, handbags and frozen catfish fillets, after trade talks between the two countries stalled.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s Office also has started the process of levying tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods, a move that would mean that virtually every Chinese import that enters the U.S. will be subject to a levy.\n\nContributing: Janna Herron\n\nTrump says he received 'beautiful letter' from China's Xi Jinping amid tense trade talks\n\nMore:Trump says tariffs only hurt China, but top adviser Kudlow admits 'both sides will suffer'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/06/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-economic-impact-damage/78244024007/", "title": "Tariffs on Mexico, Canada are delayed but levies cause economic ...", "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday delayed the 25% tariff he was set to impose on imports from Canada and Mexico this week, providing a 30-day reprieve for American retailers and manufacturers.\n\nBut the uncertainty generated by those levies, the 10% tariff he slapped on Chinese imports and the prospect of additional tariffs are already affecting the U.S. economy as companies pause hiring and investment.\n\n“The lingering threat of substantial new tariffs and possible retaliation from Canada and Mexico on U.S. exports will cause many businesses small and large to hold back more on hiring and investing than they would have otherwise due to the elevated uncertainty,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist of BMO Capital Markets.\n\nIs business confidence high now?\n\nSixty-seven percent of American executives said they were more stressed heading into 2025 than they were a year earlier, according to an online survey of 1,000 executives at companies with at least 10 employees.

His business, he said, already has dealt with pandemic-related worker shortages that have pushed up labor costs and sharply rising utility bills, both of which have narrowed his profit margins.\n\nStill, “In an inflationary environment, we’re not really in a position” to raise prices, Stephenson said, noting he competes with big-box chain stores that receive volume discounts. “At least initially, we would try to absorb it.”\n\nStephenson also said he wants to create a hospitable environment for customers, who just recently have regained their passion for in-store shopping.\n\nBut to offset the higher costs, he said he likely would have to scale back price promotions and put off renovations of the more than century-old downtown institution. Recently, he decided to upgrade the building’s facade and was planning to refurbish the interior this year.\n\n“We may have to slow down or delay some of the projects,” he said.\n\nAcross the economy, such delays could mean a softer job market and more slowly growing economy.\n\nAre there tariffs on Canada, Mexico?\n\nWhile the tariffs on China took effect Tuesday, those on Canada and Mexico were deferred until March 4 after those countries agreed to draft plans to reinforce their borders to slow the flow of illegal drugs like fentanyl and immigrants who lack permanent legal status.\n\nYet even if they reach a deal, the risk of tariffs for both countries is likely to hover until they join the U.S. in a review of their 5-year-old free trade deal in mid-2026, Goldman Sachs said in a research note.\n\nThe 10% tariff on Chinese imports – also aimed at prodding that country to halt fentanyl crossings into the U.S. – was imposed after a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping aimed at averting the fees was canceled.\n\nChinese officials said starting Feb. 10, the country would hit the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs of 15% on coal and 10% on crude oil, farm equipment and some vehicles.\n\nAdditional tariffs on imports from China, the European Union and possibly other countries are likely, according to Goldman Sachs and BMO Capital Markets. Some would address national security concerns while others would be aimed at closing the U.S. trade gap with other nations, BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients.\n\nOxford Economics estimates Canadian, Mexican and Chinese tariffs alone would raise the Federal Reserve’s preferred annual inflation measure from 2.8% to 3% by year’s end − nearly a percentage point above where it would have been absent the tariffs. Goldman and Moody’s Analytics expect a half percentage point bump to inflation this year.\n\nOxford also expects the economy to grow 1.4% this year, well below the 2.6% gain it had expected, assuming the China, Canada and Mexican tariffs are imposed and remain in effect.\n\n'I can either raise my prices or take less money'\n\nMargaret’s Boutique, a women’s clothing shop in Decorah, Iowa, buys about 15% of its dresses, sportswear, jewelry, shoes and other items from Canada and 80% from China, said owner Kelli Winchester.\n\nWinchester said she likely can absorb the 10% fee on Chinese imports or make it up on other products but a 25% tax on Canadian goods would have a deeper impact.\n\n“I can either raise my prices or take less money” in profits, Winchester said. Under the latter scenario, she said, “I’ll have less money to buy clothing.”\n\nWell-known brand-name goods, she said, have thinner profit margins. “I have no choice but to pass (the tariff) along” to customers.\n\nThis week, she said, her suppliers agreed not to pass on the tariff costs to her this year, but she’s worried she eventually could be hit by the higher fees or that shoppers coping with grocery price increases due to tariffs will spend less on clothing.\n\nThis month, Winchester had planned to hire additional employees to handle the brisk summer business she typically sees in Decorah, a tourist spot. But she’s holding off for now.\n\n“I probably want to wait to see how this all gets implemented,” she said.\n\n'Tariffs just give us a reason to pause'\n\nIn some industries, the trade battle is inflamed by political tensions.\n\nMidwest Barrel Co. of Louisville, Kentucky, sells barrels − after they’re used to age bourbon − to whiskey makers in 30 countries that distill their products in the containers for enhanced flavoring, said company CEO Jessica Loseke.\n\nLoseke fears the barrels eventually could be socked with retaliatory tariffs by China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nShe’s also concerned about a 50% tariff by the European Union on American whiskey that’s set to take effect March 31 in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on EU imports during Trump’s first term. Meanwhile, she noted, Canadian officials are pulling American bourbon and other alcohol from store shelves because of their ire over Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada.\n\nBoth developments will likely slow U.S. bourbon sales in an already weak market, reducing the global supply of used bourbon barrels and driving up their price, Loseke said. That, she said, would further dampen her sales.\n\nLoseke also has been affected more directly. A Canadian whiskey maker has suspended its barrel orders from Midwest.\n\n“They said they didn’t want to do business with a company in a ‘red’ state” that helped elect Trump, Loseke said.\n\nAs a result of the turmoil, Loseke has shelved plans to replace two staffers who recently left the 22-employee company.\n\n“What these tariffs do is they create a lot of uncertainty across the global market,” she said. “Tariffs just give us a reason to pause.\"\n\nShe added: “I don’t want to bring somebody on and have to lay them off.”\n\nThis story was updated to add new information.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/09/retailers-consumers-bracing-for-proposed-tariffs/76828204007/", "title": "How will Trump's tariffs hit your wallet? What to expect on everyday ...", "text": "Tariffs on China went into effect Tuesday – with retaliatory tariffs by China imposed on U.S. goods. Meanwhile, there's been a reprieve of one-month or more for 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico from the Trump administration.\n\nBut as things change quickly around potential implementation of tariffs on imported goods, U.S. consumers have been worrying and preparing for the hit to their wallets and retailers have been scrambling to figure out how to plan for the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China.\n\nTariffs have been a focus for US retailers\n\nEveryone was buzzing about tariffs at a Washington, D.C., event with major U.S. retailers in early December. Then President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico had, at that point, been well established.\n\n\"We exclusively talked about this topic of tariffs,\" Balika Sonthalia, a partner and practice leader of strategic operations, Americas, at global strategy and management consultancy firm Kearney, told USA TODAY.\n\nEarn rewards on your spending: Best credit cards for shopping\n\nIn addition to immigration policies, tariffs have retailers worried that “the combination of the two can put a lot of sectors in between a rock and a hard place,” she said. And with Trump repeatedly vowing tariffs were coming – and doubling down in early January after the Washington Post reported he might scale them back – U.S. retailers and consumers weren't waiting to prepare.\n\nRetailers are trying to learn “what exactly they are walking into,” said Sonthalia, whose specialty for Kearney is consumer products and retail and distribution clients.\n\nHere's the latest on Trump tariffs\n\nOn Trump's first full day in office, as previously reported by USA TODAY, the president said he would levy a blanket duty of 25% on both Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1 unless the U.S. neighbors toughen security at their borders. Trump said both nations have illegal migration and drugs flowing across their borders with the U.S. He also said he was also looking at a 10% tariff on China.\n\nThe new date for the tariffs to take effect was Tuesday, Feb. 4. But Monday morning, Mexico and the United States reached a one-month agreement to stave off tariffs and a looming trade war. President Donald Trump announced later that day he was also pausing tariffs on Canada for at least 30 days after a phone call with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe tariffs on goods from China went into effect on Tuesday. China countered, saying it would levy its own tariffs on some U.S. goods: 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and 10% tariffs for crude oil, farm equipment and some cars.\n\nIn a published note last week, Morgan Stanley Economist Michael Gapen said tariffs could be used as a negotiating tool with Mexico as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is under review in the first half of the year.\n\n\"The President's suggestion that tariffs on Mexico/Canada could come by Feb. 1 remind us that vigilance is warranted as the U.S. policy path could evolve quickly,\" Gapen said.\n\nGapen also said effects of the tariffs will be felt through 2025 and 2026 with the \"tariff shock\" being over in the second half of 2026.\n\n'Another form of inflation, just spelled differently'\n\nThe tariffs could cost consumers an additional $2,500 to $7,600 a year per household, according to estimates, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation, in an interview in December.\n\nConsumers ultimately will pay for any tariffs that are put in place, said Darpan Seth, CEO of Nextuple, which helps build and support programs to help its clients get products for consumers in stores or online. The firm's client list includes major U.S. retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods and luxury brands such as Kate Spade and Coach.\n\n“For consumers, tariffs are like another form of inflation, just spelled differently,” Seth said. “They have the same effect of rising prices.”\n\nSome consumers are going to delay major purchases or make smaller repairs if prices go up for imported goods from certain countries, he said. For example, a consumer “may want to do a quick fix instead of trying to change the carburetor in your car,” Seth said.\n\nRetailers dealing with tariffs will have no choice in the short term but to increase prices, Seth said.\n\nUS retailers are worried about tariffs\n\nGold and other industry sources say even though the Trump administration threatened tariffs on imports during Trump's first administration – and followed through on some – things are different this time.\n\nThere’s a lot of concern among retailers represented by the National Retail Federation, (NRF) which includes both large and small businesses, Gold said.\n\n“There’s so much complexity in the supply chain and so many challenges in the supply chain as it is, to have something as big as these massive tariffs, is really causing disruption in itself and folks trying to figure out ‘What am I supposed to do?'\" Gold said.\n\nSince there were been several different scenarios of tariffs being discussed, retailers have been trying to come up with plans to address them all, he said.\n\nHow will tariffs impact consumers?\n\nAn NRF study looked at the estimated impacts of the tariffs on six consumer product categories: apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.\n\nRetailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components to offer customers a variety of products, Gold said. A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not by a foreign country or the exporter, he added.\n\nThe NRF said while some U.S. manufacturers could benefit from the tariffs, the gains to U.S. producers and the Treasury from tariff revenue do not outweigh overall losses to consumers.\n\nAccording to NRF, some examples of potential price increases with tariffs include:\n\n◾ A $40 toaster oven would cost consumers $48 to $52.\n\n◾ A $50 pair of athletic shoes would cost $59 to $64.\n\n◾ A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would end up costing $2,128 to $2,190.\n\nHigher prices and loss of spending power would hit low-income families especially hard, the retail federation said in its study, released on Nov. 4.\n\nGold said while the NRF looked at six specific categories, he also believes pricing for consumer electronics, pet products, children’s products and groceries, could be hit hard by the proposed tariffs.\n\nStill, there's some optimism. Financial advisors previously told USA TODAY Trump's tariffs during his first term didn't cause \"significantly high inflation.\" And Trump's administration remains steadfast on the benefits of tariffs.\n\n“President Trump has promised tariff policies that protect working Americans from the unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets,\" said Brian Hughes, Trump-Vance transition spokesman said earlier this month. \"As he did in his first term, he will implement economic and trade policies to make life affordable and more prosperous for our nation, while simultaneously leveling the playing field for American manufacturers.”\n\nHow are US retailers reacting and preparing for tariffs?\n\nSome retailers are looking at sourcing differently while others are putting in contingency plans, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at the research and analytics firm GlobalData.\n\nThe retail federation’s retail members are trying to prepare for the best – and worst-case − scenarios, Gold said.\n\nLarger U.S. retailers have more ability to “mitigate and shift their sourcing,” Gold said. He added those shifts can't happen overnight. Smaller mom-and-pop stores and medium-sized retailers don’t have as much flexibility, he said. There's even worry the tariffs might cause some smaller retailers to go out of business, Gold said.\n\nThere have already been signs that consumers and retailers reacted to potential price increases and tariffs. According to the Wall Street Journal, some retailers during Black Friday ran advertisements for things like electronics, washing machines and refrigerators before prices increase due to tariffs. Seth said sales figures from Black Friday and Cyber Monday have shown that purchases in those categories went up.\n\nPrice increases are coming for consumers\n\nLarger retailers also warned consumers will pay higher prices with tariffs, Gold said. Price increases for consumers will be dependent on how quickly tariffs go into effect.\n\nA spokesperson for Walmart declined to comment, but in an interview with CNBC in early November before the election, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the retailer may have to raise prices on some items if Trump’s proposed tariffs take effect.\n\n“Our model is everyday low prices,\" he said in the interview. \"But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.”\n\nDollar Tree executives, in a December earnings call, said the price of the store’s products may increase again because of tariffs. The discount retailer also said, as previously reported in USA TODAY, that proposed tariffs could also change what products consumers could find at Dollar Tree.\n\nThe media relations department for Gap, which also includes Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSonthalia said retailers at the Washington meeting she attended said they could absorb costs by implementing some cost-efficiency and pricing strategies if tariffs were up to 10%. Otherwise, costs would be passed to consumers, she said.\n\nGold said even if the tariffs don't go into effect, \"just the threat alone is causing a little bit of chaos within the supply chain.\" There was also the threat of the now averted port strike earlier in January, he said.\n\nSaunders said some retailers think the tariffs might be just a Trump negotiating tool.\n\nSonthalia, whose clients include Fortune 15 companies and small and independent retailers across all sectors, including food, pharmacy, electronics and apparel, believes \"the tariffs are definitely coming.\"\n\n“It’s a question of to what degree,” she said.\n\nConsumers don't want to pay prices for goods made in the USA\n\nConsumers are price-conscious and don't want to pay what it would cost to manufacture many of the items they want in the U.S., said Lauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nManufacturing for many goods in the United States is expensive because costs are high for labor, production and building facilities, said Beitelspacher, who studies the retail industry. Moving manufacturing to the U.S. would cause prices to \"skyrocket,\" she said.\n\n\"Consumers have a reference price of what they’re willing to pay for something and if it goes over that reference price, then they really question if they need it, especially if it’s something that’s a nonessential good,” Beitelspacher said.\n\nThe U.S. also does not have some of the raw materials for some products like silks, which may be sourced overseas, so those import costs would be expensive, she said.\n\nBeitelspacher said she thinks there is a strong possibility large U.S. retailers – as well as major lobbying groups for industries such as food, apparel, retail and electronics – will push back on the Trump administration's plans.\n\nCompanies can't make changes to manufacturing quickly\n\nBesides, many retailers make business decisions six to 12 months in advance, Gold said. They couldn't afford to wait until Trump took office to make a choice.\n\nTariffs and you:What products will cost more, when prices will rise, and what to buy now\n\nStill, retailers and suppliers learned through Trump's previous administration they needed to be more nimble in their supply chains, said Gold. Relying solely on China wasn't an option, he said. Tariffs could be \"a useful part of the toolbox when talking about trade policy,\" Gold said. But it can't be the only tool, he added.\n\nOverall, the situation is complicated, Gold said.\n\nPlus, “It’s not easy to move your supply chain. It takes months, if not years to be able to do that,” Gold said.\n\nMajor U.S. apparel and footwear retailers that Beitelspacher spoke to said they are looking into other manufacturing facilities in countries like Indonesia that may not be hit with the tariffs for exports.\n\nMoves to other countries could affect product quality and more\n\nThe quality of consumer goods could also be impacted as businesses look to other countries – which might have different labor, safety and quality standards – for their manufacturing needs, Beitelspacher said.\n\nThat said, the new business due to Trump's tariffs could be an opportunity for economic growth for some developing nations, said Beitelspacher.\n\nBut, there is also a possibility that some overbooked manufacturing facilities in some countries may outsource some excess production – without the knowledge of the retailer – to what Beitelspacher called \"unauthorized facilities.\" Those facilities may have no oversight or labor policies, which might allow for longer working hours, fewer environmental protections, lower wages and less safe working conditions for employees, she said.\n\nThen, Beitelspacher said, “we’re going to have not only an environmental issue but then potentially a major human rights issue as well.”\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Former President Donald Trump’s controversial trade war with China began in 2018 when he slapped tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese-made goods. Over the next year, he added duties to more items after Beijing retaliated with tariffs on some American-made products.\n\nAfter months of escalation, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping came to a truce at the beginning of 2020, signing what’s known as the Phase One agreement. It reduced the rate of some of the tariffs, but left them in place, and China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products – setting an ambitious target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began.\n\nBut it’s becoming clear that China has failed to meet those targets. It’s on track to purchase only 60% of the goods it committed to buy, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who tracks China’s purchases.\n\nBiden suggested recently that’s the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place, despite pressure from the American business community to remove them as companies struggle with inflation and supply chain disruptions. US importers have paid nearly $123 billion to cover the cost of the China tariffs since 2018, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“It’s uncertain,” Biden said last week at a news conference when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” he added.\n\nChina falls short of Phase One commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, China committed to ramp up its purchases of US goods and agricultural projects, setting specific amounts for different categories to be bought over the next two years.\n\nEven at the time the agreement was signed, experts were skeptical China would be able to meet its pledge. When the Covid-19 pandemic slowed trade around the globe just weeks after the deal was signed, it made it even harder for Beijing to meet the targets.\n\nWhile China is importing more from the United States than it did before the tariffs were put in place, it has fallen short of its commitments.\n\nExports of US-manufactured goods, including aircraft and autos, have yet to recover to pre-trade-war levels. China has come closer to meeting its pledge when it comes to US agricultural exports, increasing its purchases of soybeans, wheat and corn. Those exports came to a near standstill in 2018.\n\nBut the Phase One agreement doesn’t dictate any repercussions in the event that China misses its goals. It’s up to Biden to decide whether to keep the tariffs in place.\n\nBiden faces pressure from the business community\n\nThe tariffs hit a wide range of Chinese-made goods, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. The duties make it more expensive for American businesses to import these goods from China, many of which are not manufactured in the US at a pace that meets the demand.\n\nAs inflation rises and supply chain disruptions continue, pressure from the business community is ramping up on the Biden administration to lift the tariffs. The move wouldn’t solve the supply chain problems, but it could help alleviate some of the inflationary pressure facing importers.\n\n“It’s never been a good time for these tariffs, and now is a particularly bad time for them,” said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe new year is “really a continuation of the worst of the problems we’ve seen,” Lamar added, noting that supply chain disruptions are still causing shipping delays, some holiday goods still haven’t arrived on store shelves, and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused some factories and retail stores to temporarily close.\n\nBiden moves ‘slow’ on trade policy\n\nAt the start of Biden’s tenure, a large part of his focus was on domestic policy, successfully pushing an economic pandemic relief bill and eventually an infrastructure investment package through Congress.\n\nBut in October, the Biden administration made some trade policy changes. It reached an agreement with the European Union to ease Trump-era sanctions on aluminum and steel. As part of the deal, the EU also agreed to drop retaliatory tariffs against American products including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.\n\nThe Biden administration also announced in October that it would reinstate some China tariff waivers that US importers had previously received. The process to apply for a reinstatement of expired waivers launched in the fall, but the requests are still under review. More than 2,000 exclusions were granted under the Trump administration but only 549 are eligible for another extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress allowed two longstanding trade programs to expire at the end of 2020 – effectively raising tariffs on a range of goods from various countries. Legislation has been introduced to renew the programs, but has yet to pass both chambers of Congress.\n\n“When it comes to trade policy, the administration is moving very slowly,” Lamar said.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/13/tariffs-china-imports-trade-war-threatens-farmers-manufacturers/1191088001/", "title": "Tariffs on China imports: Trade war threatens farmers, manufacturers", "text": "China’s announcement Monday that it will raise tariffs on $60 billion of American goods compounds the pain in what is fast becoming all-out trade war between the two countries as U.S. farmers, chemical makers and others brace for a further hit to revenue.\n\n“Effectively, that market (China) is closed to U.S. exporters,” says Ed Brzytwa, director of trade for the American Chemistry Council.\n\nChina said it’s lifting the tariffs from a range of 5% to 10% to as much as 25%, with many goods set to be taxed at the upper limit. The higher duties are scheduled to take effect June 1. About 5,000 products are affected, including beef, fruit, vegetables, coats, refrigerators, furniture and electric saws.\n\nBest state in US:Washington is the best state in America, says U.S. News rankings\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nScam alert:Social Security impostor scam: It's growing, and this is how it works\n\nChinese officials announced the countertariffs after the Trump administration on Friday raised tariffs on $200 billion in U.S. imports from China from 10% to 25%.\n\nThe retaliatory tariffs China unveiled alone won’t significantly ding the U.S. economy, cutting economic growth by about a tenth of a percentage point next year if the trade fight isn’t resolved, according to Oxford Economics and Moody’s Analytics. But all existing U.S. and Chinese duties, including those announced Monday, will shave growth by three-tenths of a percentage point next year, says Oxford economist Greg Daco. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi expects an even bigger impact of nearly half a percentage point.\n\nThe fallout for investors has been more prominent. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 600 points Monday. That’s partly because multinational corporations with significant exports could see less revenue and profits, Zandi says. The bigger toll is on business confidence and investment, he says.\n\n“It raises the probability of a full-blown trade war, which will hammer earnings,” Zandi says.\n\nSo far, China has slapped tariffs on $100 billion in U.S. goods. As a result, U.S.exports to China fell 7% in 2018, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. And Chinese investment in the U.S. was down 60% last year, “in part because of added scrutiny applied to proposed deals and a souring political climate,” the group says.\n\nU.S. farmers, who have been especially affected by China’s tariffs last year, are likely to suffer an additional blow.\n\nJohn Heisdorffer, a soybean farmer in Keota, Iowa, has lost about $10,000 since China put a 25% levy on U.S. soybean shipments last year as prices fell from more than $10 a bushel to about $8. U.S. soybean exports to China effectively halted before rising modestly recently as part of Chinese concessions during negotiations. Heisdorffer says he has cut back on investments in new equipment.\n\nAfter Monday’s news, soybean futures fell another seven cents. Although soybeans aren’t directly affected by the latest round of Chinese tariffs, various soy-related oils and extracts will be hit.\n\n“I thought it was going to be resolved last week,” Heisdorffer says. “I don’t know what to think now. It continues to ratchet down the amount of cash we have to pay bills.\"\n\nIf the conflict drags on, he says, there won’t be anything left to give his son, who plans to take over the farm when Heisdorffer, 67, retires.\n\nHeisdorffer, who is chairman of the American Soybean Association, also worries the number of soybean farmers who go bankrupt will increase substantially if the latest Chinese tariff isn’t removed. “People are going to be hanging by a thread,” he says.\n\nDow:Dow stock swings are exhausting, but here's how to survive\n\nSocial media pressure:Young people, scrolling their friends' Instagram feeds, feel pressure to overspend\n\nStefanie Smallhouse, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, said the prospects of tariffs that could undercut exports to China come at an already bad time for the state’s agricultural industry.\n\nFarmers and ranchers already have been paying higher prices for equipment, seed, fertilizer and other expenditures – partly due to tariffs that raised the price of steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. Plus, they face uncertainty in exporting to Mexico and Canada pending approval of a revamped North American trade agreement.\n\n“We’re being squeezed on both sides,” said Smallhouse, who with her husband owns a livestock ranch near Tucson. “At this point, it’s a downhill slide.”\n\nLonger term, the tariffs and heightened trade tensions mean farmers and ranchers face missed opportunities and the prospect of losing market share in China, which she described as an important export destination for Arizona agricultural products, especially dairy and meat.\n\nChina also represents the third-largest export market for U.S. chemical makers. Last year, U.S. chemical exports to China rose just 2.7% after notching double-digit gains in 2016 and 2017. The U.S. offers high-quality, inexpensive products, largely because of cheap prices for natural gas, a feedstock for many chemicals used to make plastics, oil-related goods, pharmaceuticals, construction and other products in China, Brzytwa of the ACC says.\n\nWith many chemical makers eyeing China as a prime market, about $200 billion in new factories are being planned in the U.S. But some could move to other countries if the newest tariff remains, Brzytwa says. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers could shift their chemical purchases to domestic suppliers or other Asian countries.\n\nBASF, a Germany-based chemical manufacturer with more than 100 facilities in North America, said it's \"concerned about the U.S. announcements, and the response of several of its trading partners, to impose import tariffs on a wide range of products that could affect the chemical industry and its numerous customer industries.\"\n\nThe company said it's still assessing the potential effects of the latest round of increased Chinese tariffs on its American operations.\n\nContributing: Russ Wiles, Arizona Republic; Yan Zhang; Nathan Bomey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/11/26/trumps-tariffs-raise-inflation/76600310007/", "title": "Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico would lift inflation, hit economy", "text": "The tariffs President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on imports from Mexico and Canada would significantly increase U.S. inflation next year and modestly curtail economic growth, economists and trade experts say.\n\nMonday, Trump vowed to hit all goods shipped to the U.S. from Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff and all Chinese imports with a 10% levy on his first day in office, Jan. 20. In a social media post, Trump said his aim is to pressure the countries to stop the flow into the U.S. of illegal drugs and immigrants who lack permanent legal status.\n\nSeveral experts said the threat was probably a negotiating tactic intended to prod the countries to take action on drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Trump administration probably would schedule the fees to take effect in March, which would give countries time to negotiate a deal that addresses the disputes.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the levies likely would spark retaliatory tariffs from Mexico and Canada, possibly creating an intractable trade conflict.\n\n“At that point, it’s very difficult to unwind the tariff wars,” Hufbauer said.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nBut if Trump follows though on his pledge, it would substantially boost inflation next year after pandemic-induced consumer price increases had largely abated, economists said.\n\nEconomists already had anticipated at least a 10% tariff on Chinese imports next year and built that into their forecasts. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would impose a 10% to 20% tariff on all imports and as much as a 60% duty on Chinese goods to incentivize companies to move production to the U.S. or buy American-made products.\n\nWhat does America import from Mexico?\n\nHigh tariffs on Mexico and Canada were not expected and would violate the North American trade pact that took effect in 2020. The U.S. imported $480 billion in goods from Mexico last year, including vehicles, electrical equipment, machinery, furniture, plastics and metal, according to Trading Economics.\n\nHow much does the US import from Canada?\n\nThe $429 billion in 2024 imports from Canada included vehicles, machinery, wood, metal and pharmaceutical products, Trading Economics figures show.\n\nNew fees on goods from Mexico, Canada and China would cost a typical American family an additional $1,300 a year, said Brendan Duke, senior director of economic policy a the left-leaning Center for American Progress.\n\nTariffs would especially hobble the U.S. auto industry, which imports raw materials from Mexico to make parts that are then shipped back to that country for vehicle assembly, Hufbauer said. Some parts cross the border several times as they’re enhanced before vehicles are sold to American consumers, which could pile on several rounds of tariffs.\n\nThe duties could increase the price of cars and trucks sold in the U.S. by about 10%, Hufbauer said. And by damping auto sales or prompting manufacturers in other countries to switch to non-U.S. parts suppliers, the levies could mean layoffs for some of the 1 million U.S. auto manufacturing workers., Hufbauer said.\n\nThough manufacturers or retailers could absorb some of the cost increases, Deutsche Bank figures most would be passed on to American consumers. About 5% of the goods and services that make up the Fed’s preferred inflation index are imported from Canada or Mexico, Deutsche Bank estimates.\n\nWhat is the inflation target for 2025?\n\nThe research firm had expected a core measure of that inflation index, which excludes volatile food and energy items, to dip just slightly from 2.7% in September to 2.6% by the end of next year because of Trump’s planned tariffs on Chinese goods. Duties on the North American trading partners probably would push inflation higher, to 3.7% next year, Deutsche Bank said in a research note.\n\nWithout any levies, inflation probably would tumble to 2.2% in 2025, said Deutsche Bank economist Justin Weidner.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts tariffs on Mexico and Canada would lead to a slightly smaller 0.9% rise in the core inflation measure in 2025.\n\nBut that measure had fallen sharply from a peak of 5.6% in early 2022.\n\n“Inflation was set to come down” further, Weidner said. “This would undercut the progress.”\n\nHe added that prices theoretically would increase just next year but wouldn’t continue to rise due to tariffs after that, allowing inflation to return to the lower rate that would have prevailed absent the levies in 2026. But the level of prices would be permanently higher, Weidner said.\n\nTrump won the election largely because of Americans’ frustration over inflation and their perception of the Biden-Harris administration’s role in contributing to it, polls showed. Trump has pledged to bring prices down.\n\nHow much will the US economy grow?\n\nThe new fees also would hurt economic growth. By reducing consumer spending and prompting Mexico and Canada to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. shipments to those countries – largely on agricultural products – the fees could lower the nation's economic growth by three-tenths of a percentage point in 2026 to just under 2%, Weidner said.\n\nAmong other effects, higher inflation could mean the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates fewer times next year, damping consumer and business borrowing and economic activity, Weidner said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/business/2025/02/03/trump-slaps-tariffs-on-china-canada-heres-how-that-works/78179668007/", "title": "Trump slaps tariffs on China, Canada. Here's how that works", "text": "UPDATE:US tariffs on Canadian imports paused for 30 days, Trudeau says\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on goods coming from Canada and 10% on goods from China starting Tuesday, in what he has said is a bid to clamp down on the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the U.S.\n\nHe had also announced 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico, but on Monday the U.S. and Mexico announced a one-month agreement to stave off tariffs as Mexico sends 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border and Trump said he will work to slow the flow of American weapons south of the border.\n\nThe background behind tariffs can be a bit murky, given the political dialogue around them.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\n\"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world, and the tariff will be substantial,” Trump said during the presidential debate against then-Vice President Kamala Harris last September.\n\nStarting Tuesday, the tariffs will be set at 25% for goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and 10% on imports from China.\n\nThe leaders of both Canada and Mexico had vowed to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S products, particularly targeting goods from GOP-led states.\n\nWho pays the tariffs?\n\nStrictly speaking, the importer, not the source country, pays the tariffs. They come in the form of “taxes or duties levied on importers,” according to Investopedia, a consumer finance website.\n\nTariffs would be paid by whoever is importing the foreign goods. They would then pass those costs on to the American consumer, said Parul Jain, who teaches finance at the Rutgers Business School in Newark. Other companies might also use the tariff-induced price increases as an excuse to raise their own prices, Jain said.\n\nTrump conceded on his social media website, Truth Social, that Americans could feel “some pain” from the tariffs, but that “it will all be worth the price that must be paid.”\n\nWhere are tariffs paid?\n\nTariffs are paid “at the time of customs clearance” in whatever port the goods are moving through, said the International Trade Administration, which is part of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nThat would mean products coming in through New Jersey would be paid at the Ports of Elizabeth and Newark.\n\nStory continues below chart.\n\nWhy are tariffs levied?\n\nOne reason for tariffs is to compel a country to behave a certain way. Trump recently used tariffs to that end to some success with Colombia to ensure the South American nation’s acceptance of U.S. military flights carrying deported Colombian migrants.\n\nTrump is also hoping that companies would find it cheaper to manufacture products in the United States, said Jain, the Rutgers professor.\n\nBut such a process can take years, and some goods such as coffee, cocoa beans and avocados simply can’t be produced domestically at high volume.\n\nTariffs could also be used as a source of revenue for a country, said the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump has floated the idea of a so-called “External Revenue Service” that would collect tariffs and revenue.\n\nWhat items from Canada could be affected by Trump's tariffs?\n\nThe following common imports from Canada to the U.S., according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and the website Trading Economics, could be affected by Trump's tariffs:\n\nWood.\n\nCharcoal.\n\nAluminum.\n\nIron and steel appliances.\n\nCereal, flour, starch and milk products.\n\nRubber.\n\nAlcoholic beverages.\n\nCarpets and other textile floor coverings.\n\nWool, animal hair, horsehair yarn and fabric.\n\nUmbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks and whips.\n\nCotton.\n\nPhotographic or cinematographic goods.\n\nCork products.\n\nPrinted books.\n\nWhat items from Mexico could be affected by Trump's tariffs?\n\nItems the U.S. imports from Mexico, according to Trading Economics and the OEC, that could be affected if Trump's tariff plan goes into effect include:\n\nCereals.\n\nPaper products.\n\nProcessed fruits and nuts.\n\nTropical fruits.\n\nTomatoes, onions, lettuce and cabbage.\n\nPickled foods.\n\nFruit juice.\n\nFertilizers.\n\nDairy products, eggs and honey.\n\nCotton.\n\nBeer and hard liquor.\n\nCoffee, tea, mate and spices.\n\nMeat, fish and seafood.\n\nSauces and seasonings.\n\nBaked goods.\n\nAvocados.\n\nRaw sugar.\n\nWhat items from China could be affected by Trump's tariffs?\n\nCommon imports to the U.S. from China, according to Trading Economics and the U.S. Agriculture Department, that could be affected by Trump's tariff plan include:\n\nFish and crustaceans.\n\nVegetable fats and oils.\n\nVegetables (especially corn), fruit and nuts.\n\nSoaps, lubricants, waxes, candles and modeling pastes.\n\nCereal, flour, starch, wheat and milk products.\n\nCoffee, tea and spices.\n\nSugar.\n\nCocoa.\n\nDairy products, eggs, honey and edible products.\n\nVinegar.\n\nApple juice.\n\nGarlic.\n\nThis article contains material from USA Today.\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100 and Facebook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/17/trade-war-trump-readies-tariffs-another-200-billion-chinese-goods/1336684002/", "title": "U.S. slaps tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods as trade ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. slapped tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports on Monday, ratcheting up ongoing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economic powers.\n\nIn a statement, President Donald Trump announced he has directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to impose the new tariffs in response to what he said are unfair trade practices by China.\n\n“As president, it is my duty to protect the interests of working men and women, farmers, ranchers, businesses, and our country itself,” Trump said. “My administration will not remain idle when those interests are under attack.”\n\nThe tariffs, announced after financial markets in the U.S. closed, will take effect on Sept. 24 and will initially be set at a rate of 10 percent. That rate will jump to 25 percent on Jan. 1.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Tuesday it will take “counter-measures,” but gave no further details.\n\nThe announcement means the Trump administration has now levied duties on a total $250 billion worth of Chinese goods – roughly half of the Chinese-made products shipped into the U.S. China has retaliated by placing duties on an equal dollar amount of U.S. goods and threatened retaliatory tariffs on another $60 billion in U.S. products in response to the Trump administration’s latest actions.\n\nIf that happens, Trump said he would impose tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese imports. If he follows through with that threat, virtually every product imported into the U.S. from China would be subject to a tariff.\n\nU.S. officials said they remain open to discussions with China to resolve the trade dispute but warned that China must be willing to change its ways and refrain from unfair trade practices, including theft of U.S. technology and intellectual property.\n\nChina reportedly was planning to send one of its top economic officials to Washington later this month in an attempt to jump-start the talks. It was unclear whether the Chinese would be willing to go ahead with that meeting after the latest round of tariffs.\n\n“For months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies,” Trump said. “We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.”\n\nChina has had many opportunities to fully address U.S. concerns, Trump said.\n\n“Once again, I urge China’s leaders to take swift action to end their country’s unfair trade practices,” he said. “Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi (Jinping) of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.”\n\nThe tariffs are the latest volley in a tit-for-tat trade war that started over the summer, when the U.S. imposed a 25 percent duty that affected $34 billion in Chinese imports, including farm equipment, motor vehicles, medical equipment and products made of aluminum and steel. That was followed by a second round of tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nChina responded by slapping an extra 25 percent duty on 545 products from the United States, including soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars.\n\nTrump then suggested another round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. In July, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office released a list of product lines that it said would potentially be impacted, including fish and other foods, handbags, luggage and wood products used in construction.\n\nAt a series of hearings held last month, scores of U.S. companies and groups representing the bridal industry, candle makers, handbag designers, bicycle-parts distributors and others implored the Trump administration not to go forward with additional tariffs.\n\nThe administration received more than 6,000 written comments and heard testimony from more than 350 witnesses, many of whom argued that new tariffs would be catastrophic for their businesses.\n\nAfter reviewing the comments, the administration said it had agreed to remove more than 300 product lines from the list and exempt them from the latest round of tariffs.\n\nThe exempted products include certain electronic consumer products, such as smart watches and Bluetooth devices; certain chemicals for manufactured goods, textile and agriculture; and certain health and safety products, such as bicycle helmets, rubber and plastic gloves, and child-safety furniture such as highchairs, car seats and playpens.\n\nStill, trade analysts warned that the latest round of tariffs would hit a broad range of consumer goods and would be felt especially hard by low- and middle-income Americans.\n\n“The Trump administration’s latest round of tariffs on imports from China are a direct tax on millions of working American families,” said Daniel Griswold of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “The tax revenue the president brags about raising will come straight from the pockets of the people he claims to represent.”\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the tariffs show that Trump is clearly ratcheting up pressure on China to come to the table – and the sooner, the better.\n\n“There is no disagreement between Congress and the president that we must hold China accountable for hurting U.S. companies and workers on a colossal scale by extorting our companies to transfer their best technology, stealing our intellectual property and shoring up China’s state-run companies through subsidies and other distortive practices,” Brady said.\n\nAt the same time, Brady said he worries that additional tariffs will mean Americans will be forced to pay extra for imported goods. He urged Trump and Chinese President Xi to develop a long-term solution that levels the playing field for American manufacturers, farmers and workers.\n\nMore:Tariffs on imported cars, parts could harm U.S. economy and auto industry, experts warn\n\nMore:China files complaint to WTO over US plan for tariffs on $200 billion of goods", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/01/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china/78133068007/", "title": "Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico; China is hit with ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a trio of executive orders on Saturday, imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, starting Tuesday.\n\nAn exception was made for Canadian energy, including natural gas and oil. Tariffs on energy imports from Canada were set at a lower rate of 10%, a White House official said, to minimize the potential for disruptions in gasoline and home heating prices.\n\nThe global financial markets are expected to kick off Monday after America's two top trading partners, Canada and Mexico, vowed immediate retaliation, and China is considering \"countermeasures,\" according to Reuters.\n\nTariffs have been central to Trump’s economic strategy, and part of an attempt to increase tax revenue and protect jobs. He has also used them as a negotiating tool, threatening tariffs against countries as a way to achieve a myriad of policy concessions.\n\nMexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum denounced the tariffs and lashed out at Trump’s suggestion that the Mexican government was collaborating with drug traffickers.\n\nIf the U.S. wanted to address the serious consumption of fentanyl, they could “combat the sale of narcotics on the streets of their main cities, which they do not do,” according to a Google translation of her post on X.\n\n“Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs, but by talking and dialoguing,” she added.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to the U.S. trade action with 25% tariffs of its own against $155 billion worth of American goods.\n\nThat includes immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days, he said.\n\nTrump’s action will not only harm Canadians but will have “real consequences” for the American people, said Trudeau. “(It) will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American auto assembly, plants and other manufacturing facilities,” he said. “They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery store and gas at the pump.”\n\nThis move will also obstruct access to materials crucial for U.S. security, such as nickel uranium, steel and aluminum, he said.\n\nDecision time for Trump on tariffs:Will the U.S. president seek revenue or revenge?\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in response to a previous inquiry on the tariffs, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said, \"China will also firmly defend its own interests.\"\n\nTrump also noted in his executive orders that if the targeted countries retaliate against the tariffs imposed, he \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this Executive Order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"\n\nTrump weighing a universal tariff\n\nTrump is also debating a universal tariff and fees on the European Union but has not specified how much they would be and did not impose them on Saturday. He told reporters Friday that he was looking to hike tariffs on steel, aluminum, and eventually, copper. Tariffs on pharmaceuticals and computer chips are also on their way, he said.\n\nHe also vowed a blanket tariff on oil and gas imports by Feb. 18.\n\n\"We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all,\" Trump said in a social media post on Saturday announcing the tariffs. \"I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it seized 27,023 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2023, which was nearly double the 14,700 pounds of fentanyl the agency says it took into its possession in 2022.\n\nFentanyl overdoses caused an estimated 74,702 deaths in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, down slightly from an estimated 76,226 deaths in 2022.\n\n\"The tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China send a powerful message that the United States will no longer stand by as other nations fail to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into our country,\" House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said a statement.\n\nThe chairman of the House's tax-writing committee said the U.S. must \"use all available tools including tariffs\" to fight drug trafficking and fentanyl distribution.\n\nCanada and Mexico are the top sources of U.S. crude imports, together accounting for around one-quarter of the oil U.S. refiners process into fuels such as gasoline and heating oil, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIn 2022, Canada accounted for 60% of crude oil imports to the U.S., while 10% of crude oil came from Mexico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nRefineries purchase crude oil to produce gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products.\n\nEconomists have long warned that tariffs – duties on imports – will boost inflation and hurt consumers. Trump and his advisers have dismissed those concerns, pointing to data that shows inflation was low in his first term, even after he put duties on certain nations and products.\n\n\"Tariffs don't cause inflation. They cause success,\" Trump said on Friday. \"There could be some temporary short-term disruption, and people will understand that.\"\n\nDemocrats accused him of waging a trade war in statements responding to his tariffs on Saturday, in which they took issue with Trump imposing a higher rate of duties on U.S. allies Mexico and Canada than he did on competitor nation China.\n\n\"While China is stealing our technology and actively undermining American industry, Trump is cracking down more than twice as hard on maple syrup and avocados from Canada and Mexico. How does that make sense?\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a post on X.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul also raised concerns about the potential inflationary effect of the tariffs on the social media platform. \"Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.\"\n\n\"We won the last election by complaining about Democrats' policies, which gave us high prices. Tariff lovers will be forced to explain the persistence of high prices,\" Paul, a libertarian from Kentucky, said.\n\nTrump relies on national emergency authority to impose tariffs\n\nThe White House said Saturday that Trump was utilizing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nIEEPA gives the president authority to deal with any \"unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"\n\nTrump said his administration determined that the \"sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs\" was enough to trigger the authority, which the White House said would not be lifted until it determined that the crisis had been alleviated.\n\nIn a statement, Reps. Suzan DelBene of Washington and Don Beyer of Virginia, two Democratic lawmakers who have introduced legislation seeking to restrict Trump's ability to unilaterally levy tariffs, accused him of a \"blatant abuse of executive power.\"\n\n\"Congress must reassert its authority by reining in this egregious misuse of the law,\" the lawmakers said.\n\nThe tariffs could prompt legal action, with parties arguing that Trump is not using the authority the way Congress intended, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former undersecretary of commerce for export administration.\n\nBut he said, \"The reality is, the bar for what constitutes the emergency has gotten pretty low over the years, so I think he gets away with it.\"\n\nIn the first of the orders to be published, Trump officially threatened to expand tariffs against Canada, if the country sought to retaliate.\n\n\"Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action,\" the order said.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Francesca Chambers are White House Correspondents for USA TODAY.

It can cost anywhere from $300 to $3,000 each round, and the first try often fails.\n\nOther treatments, like in vitro fertilization (IVF) can be even more expensive, running between $15,000 and $30,000 for a singular round.\n\nThat means that many people who need such treatments to reproduce often can't afford them. But that could be changing with the introduction of a new at-home artificial insemination kit.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the kit for use by consumers. Here's what you need to know, including who makes the kit and how much it costs.\n\nMosie Baby Kit first at-home insemination product cleared by FDA\n\nUnusual birth:70-year-old woman gives birth to twins in Uganda thanks to IVF, health officials say\n\nThe new kit was made by Mosie Baby, an Austin, Texas-based company that describes itself as \"a pioneering at-home fertility care company.\"\n\nThey have made the Mosie Baby Kit, which is now the first and only FDA-cleared over-the-counter option for intravaginal insemination. According to the company, the kit was found to be \"substantially equivalent\" to a clinically administered insemination.\n\nThe kit is designed for use with either a fresh or cryogenically frozen donor semen sample, meaning those attempting to conceive have a few options for a sperm source and could potentially use an outside donor, according to a company news release on Wednesday.\n\nThe kit comes with two syringes and two cups for semen collection. The syringes are described as having a \"barrel-free tip and slit opening,\" which allows for a more direct transfer with minimal waste.\n\nHow much do the kits cost and where can I buy them?\n\nThe kits cost $129.99 and are being sold on the company's website, and at cvs.com, walmart.com and optumstore.com.\n\n\"Nearly 10 years ago, my husband and I were devastated by a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and were desperate for options that were safe, financially accessible and easy to use at home,\" said Mosie Baby co-founder and CEO Maureen Brown in a statement.\n\nShe said that she and her husband first invented the kit in 2014 and that it has since helped more than 100,000 people conceive. USA TODAY was unable to independently verify that statement.\n\nWhat is artificial insemination?\n\nOne in six people is affected by infertility globally, and the rates of infertility are generally consistent among high, low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nInfertility doesn't discriminate, but access to treatment certainly does.\n\nPut simply, infertility is defined as an inability to reproduce by natural means. Roughly 20% of heterosexual, cisgender women in the U.S. struggle to get pregnant after one year of trying, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This can be caused by cisgender male factors, such as low sperm count or the ability of sperm to move efficiently, or female factors, such as ovulation disorders or uterine abnormalities.\n\nOther types of people turn to artificial insemination to produce pregnancy as well, such as same-sex couples, single parents by choice or transgender people. Whatever the reason, artificial insemination is a common first step in trying to conceive with medical assistance.\n\nArtificial insemination makes the natural process more direct, placing semen straight into the vagina, cervix, or uterus close to or during ovulation to maximize the chances of fertilization.\n\nThere are a few types of artificial insemination available to people trying to conceive. Intracervical insemination is performed in a healthcare setting and entails injecting sperm into the cervix using a syringe. Intrauterine insemination is also performed in a clinical setting and is done by putting sperm into the uterine cavity and then performing sperm washing, which concentrates the sample.\n\nAt-home insemination was also an option before the Mosie Baby Kit, but there was no specific over-the-counter kit that was FDA-cleared. With this method, fresh or frozen sperm can be placed at the part of the cervix that attaches to the vagina using a syringe or cup, at home without the help of a professional.\n\nEach method has its own success rate, advantages and drawbacks. Many individual factors go into successful conception but with more affordable at-home options, more people might be able to give it a try.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/health/ivf-women-jennifer-aniston-wellness-cec/index.html", "title": "Their IVF journeys did not end with children.

Of financial strains and painful questions from loved ones and strangers alike on why they don’t have children.\n\n“The current infertility narrative is dominated by success stories, as people seem more willing to talk about their experience after they’ve become a parent,” says Katy Seppi, 40. “For those of us who close our infertility chapters without a baby, we’re often met with unsolicited advice, reinforcing the narrative that we obviously gave up too early.”\n\nAniston’s story helped put a face to people who are involuntarily childless – a deeply personal struggle many say they quietly face in the shadows.\n\nHere are their stories.\n\nShe plunged into grief after giving up trying to have a child\n\nSeppi struggled with infertility for four years. In April 2017, she turned to IVF.\n\nShe picked baby names and a birthing center. She had a room ready for a nursery at her home in Salt Lake City. But after one cycle of IVF, her embryos were not viable.\n\nThe process worsened her fibroids – noncancerous growths in the uterus – and her endometriosis, a condition in which the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. Seppi decided not to pursue a second cycle after her reproductive endocrinologist warned it would likely lead to a similar outcome as the first one, she says.\n\nFor Seppi, the detailed ovulation calendars, obsessive attempts to conceive and the despair that came with negative pregnancy tests became unbearable. After weighing all her reproductive health concerns, she decided to end her motherhood journey and get a hysterectomy in 2017, a decision that initially plunged her into a grief that she described as all-encompassing.\n\n\"I stopped to protect my physical, emotional and mental health,\" says Katy Seppi, 40, of her decision to end her infertility journey. Courtesy Katy Seppi\n\n“I am one of the lucky few who had IVF coverage through my employer, so it didn’t come as a financial sacrifice for me,” she says. “But I stopped to protect my physical, emotional and mental health. My heart would shatter every month when I’d get my period, and I didn’t know how much more I could take.”\n\nShe started seeing a therapist who told her it’s OK to put herself first and helped her process what not having a baby meant for her future.\n\n“I’d spent my whole life dreaming about motherhood. … I stayed at my job so I’d have maternity leave – I had held space in my life for a baby,” she says. “Through therapy, grief work, and connecting with others in the childless community, I slowly started to create a new vision for my life. I chose myself and my wellbeing over holding onto the hope of a baby.”\n\nDuring her infertility journey, Seppi says couldn’t find many resources for people who are involuntarily childless. She poured her energy into trying to change that. She started a blog and an Instagram account devoted to childless people, and slowly began to connect with them.\n\nShe also founded Chasing Creation, an online community of people facing similar challenges that now hosts an annual online summit.\n\nSeppi says she believes Aniston’s openness about her own IVF journey helps validate the experiences of many people who are involuntarily childless.\n\n“There’s a common belief that anyone can have a baby if they want it enough, hope enough, and never give up,” she says. “It just isn’t true, and leads to a lot of misunderstanding and dismissal of the grief you’re left with when you realize you have to let go of your dream of parenthood.”\n\nThe many decisions surrounding the IVF process took a toll on her\n\nWhen Sherrae Lachhu decided to undergo IVF, she bought a pregnancy journal, maternity clothes and egg retrieval T-shirts for her and her husband.\n\nThe T-shirts were emblazoned with the words: “Legs up, lights out, time to get my eggs out.”\n\nLachhu, who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, had a good feeling about it. She bought about a dozen white and gray onesies, and a couple of additional pink ones, hoping for a baby girl.\n\nBut her two rounds of IVF were unsuccessful. The first one led to a positive pregnancy test in February, and bleeding and a miscarriage about six weeks later. The second transfer was conducted last month, around the time the first baby would have been due, and was not successful.\n\nIt takes immense strength to pursue a lifelong dream that comes with repeated disappointments, Lachhu says.\n\n\"For someone like myself with ADHD, the decision fatigue was at times overwhelming,\" Sherrae Lachhu, 45, says about the IVF process. Courtesy Sherrae Lachhu\n\nEvery stage of her journey involved numerous decisions, including whether to test an embryo and how many to get implanted, she says.\n\n“The toughest part has been the decision-making process. There are many decisions you have to make, starting with the decision to even embark on this journey when you’re at an advanced age, as I am,” says Lachhu, 45, an entrepreneur who owns a virtual practice for coaching and therapy.\n\n“Then decisions around the medical provider, which protocol sounds like it might work best for you, the loads of supplements the IVF community encourages you to take, the decision to continue to eat and drink as you normally would or go clean for months or years on end. For someone like myself with ADHD, the decision fatigue was at times overwhelming.”\n\nLachhu has three stepchildren through marriage but says she has moments of sadness in which she thinks about what she’s lost. She says she and her husband hope to keep trying to have a child, but their financial options are limited. Her husband’s job pays for two rounds of IVF, but they’ve exhausted those opportunities.\n\nFor them to try again, she says, her husband would have to get another job that provides the benefits all over again. Or they’d have to raise their own funds.\n\nLachhu says people sometimes ask her whether she chose not to have her own kids.\n\n“It likely doesn’t dawn on most of them that infertility is much more common than they realize, and every woman doesn’t just get pregnant and experience a live birth because she desires children.”\n\nHer embryos didn’t survive, but she still owed $17,000\n\nMeaghan Hamm, 35, went through the egg retrieval and fertilization process in August.\n\nDoctors collected seven mature eggs, and after fertilization, she ended up with five embryos. But none of them survived.\n\nIt was an emotional and financial blow for Hamm, a customer support agent at a bank in Ontario, Canada. She’d paid for the process by skipping vacations with her husband and getting money from her family.\n\n“The toughest part was feeling like we are getting somewhere to have five embryos and end up with none with no actual chance to do a transfer,” she says. “It was a rough blow financially since we still had to pay for everything.”\n\n\"Many people are uneducated on infertility issues and have this belief that IVF will fix it,\" says Meaghan Hamm, 35. Courtesy Meaghan Hamm\n\nThe egg retrieval cost almost $12,000 and the medication about $5,000, she says. Testing on the embryos would have been an additional $5,000, but the couple didn’t have to pay for that since they did not get to that stage.\n\nIn Ontario, the provincial government pays for one cycle of egg retrieval, but there’s a wait list of nearly two years, she says. She says she and her husband paid out of pocket, but their names remain on the wait list.\n\nHamm says that stories of unsuccessful IVF procedures are not told enough and as a result, most people don’t understand what the process entails and how difficult it can be. Aniston’s story sheds light on these struggles and may help reduce the stigma for people who feel they are judged for not having children, Hamm says.\n\n“Many people are uneducated on infertility issues and have this belief that IVF will fix it,” she says. “The concept of IVF fixing infertility needs to end. People sharing their unsuccessful IVF stories will help others see that it isn’t their fault. It can help others not feel so alone.”\n\nShe felt like a failure when her IVF didn’t work\n\nApril Barsby, 32, had one cycle of IVF in September of last year. Her lone mature egg was graded a C, she says, but it was the only one she had and she hoped it would help fulfill her dream of motherhood.\n\nBarsby, who lives in Norman, Oklahoma, struggled with endometriosis and low egg count, so she’d pinned her dreams on one egg.\n\n“The hardest part about it was all of my hopes being crushed at the very end, as my sweet little egg didn’t stick and my cycle failed,” she says. “I only had one mature egg after my retrieval and put all my hope and excitement into it.”\n\n\"I had a very hard time for months to even feel remotely like a woman due to my body's failure,\" says April Barsby, 32. Courtesy April Barsby\n\nBarsby does not have a job. Her friends and family donated items she then sold at yard sales to help fund the procedure.\n\nThe process drained her and her husband’s finances and left her struggling to accept her body. The couple put their IVF journey on pause for now and Barsby says she’s not sure what to do next.\n\n“My husband is my biggest supporter and it hasn’t affected our marriage in any way,” she says. “I had a very hard time for months to even feel remotely like a woman due to my body’s failure.”\n\nBarsby says she grew up watching Aniston on “Friends” and was reassured to realize the wealthy celebrity with the girl-next-door persona went through similar struggles. She says Aniston’s story will raise awareness about the negative side of IVF and what it does to prospective parents who go through the process without producing a baby.\n\n“Having no baby at the end can be extremely disheartening and destructive to a person’s mental health,” she says. “I’m not sure there’s any right way to normalize infertility, but to talk about it and let the women and men share their stories is a good start.”\n\nBarsby says she’s doing better a year later. But she still grieves over what could have been.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/04/23/future-treatment-infertility-ethics/11509269002/", "title": "Future of fertility? Scientists create babies without egg, sperm", "text": "Scientists are getting closer to the possibility of making a new person from skin or blood cells – without the need for sex.\n\nThis approach goes well beyond in vitro fertilization, which combines egg and sperm in a laboratory, because it doesn't require natural eggs or sperm.\n\nCalled in vitro gametogenesis, or IVG, it promises to someday provide a cure for many types of infertility, to slow or even turn off biological clocks, and to enable the kind of embryo selection that sends chills up many spines.\n\nIn a three-day meeting last week at the National Academies of Sciences, researchers eagerly discussed their work, advocates laid out their vision for making IVG useful, and ethicists squirmed in their seats.\n\n\"The search for a 'perfect' race, 'perfect' baby, 'perfect generation' is not science fiction,\" Amrita Pande, a sociologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, told the group Thursday.\n\nThe technology for making babies from cells other than eggs and sperm still remains a decade away or more.\n\nBut now – before the science turns possibility into reality – is a good time for the public to consider the implications of IVG, said I. Glenn Cohen, an expert on the intersection of law and bioethics at Harvard Law School.\n\n\"There's certainly a lot of publications and a lot of interest in the scientific community, and it's great that we're introducing it to a larger community,\" Cohen said after the first day's presentations. \"If people have serious ethical concerns, this is the time to spell them out.\"\n\n'Big shift' for cancer treatment: mRNA vaccine shows promise against melanoma\n\nEggs from male mice\n\nIn one of the latest advances in the field, Japanese researcher Katsuhiko Hayashi showed in March that he can transform skin cells from adult male mice into healthy eggs.\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of the mouse eggs he made were viable, but the mice grown from these egg cells were healthy and able to have pups and grandpups of their own.\n\nHe envisions eventually using this approach to treat infertility in people who have extra sex chromosomes, such as XXY or XYY, as compared with the typical XX for females and XY for males. It also could allow single-sex couples to have a child who is biologically related to both parents.\n\nHayashi also has developed a method of making viable sperm from adult male mouse cells, and he and others are working to mature eggs made from adult females – all of which fit under the rubric of IVG.\n\n\"My primary wish is to contribute to helping people suffering from infertility,\" Hayashi said in an interview last month. \"What I am doing now is very basic biology.\"\n\nIn animals, IVG could be used to conserve species in danger of extinction, said Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Harvard Medical School and director of life sciences at Boston's Museum of Science.\n\nLatest news:Patients worried IVF treatments could become illegal under abortion bans, doctors say\n\nBut whether IVG could ever be considered safe in humans, and how many embryos would have to be sacrificed in the process, remain open questions.\n\nAnd while the science may be driven by curiosity, everyone agrees it will be used to make money from people desperate to continue their biological line or just willing to pay for the offspring of their choice.\n\n\"It is a perversion of the sanctity of procreation as a fundamental aspect of human life,\" said Ben Hurlbut, a bioethicist and historian of science at Arizona State University, before the meeting. \"It makes it into an industrial project that responds to and also inspires and cultivates the desires of their future customers.\"\n\nAlready several startups backed by private venture capital are looking to commercialize the creation of lab-made eggs and sperm, perhaps first in farm animals.\n\nAnimal testing no longer required for drug approval: But high-tech substitutes aren't ready.\n\nThe ethical perspective\n\nOne ethical question raised by IVG is who benefits from this kind of work.\n\n\"The child that would be created exists not for its own sake but for the sake of others,\" Hurlbut said. \"That child is the expression of other people's desires.\"\n\nSeveral people at the conference raised the specter of 90-year-olds having offspring in this way, or babies having babies, or long-dead people.\n\nResearchers and ethicists alike agree it's OK to tinker with genes for the sake of curing a sick child. Those genetic changes won't be passed down to future generations.\n\nIVG doesn't tinker with genetics, it just uses the programs already in place in a cell to give it a different function – turning a skin cell into a sperm cell, for instance. But once this can be done in an unlimited way, people could choose among dozens, hundreds or thousands of embryos, compared with IVF in which just a handful of embryos are created.\n\nCutting-edge advances in cancer are underway: Here are 3 that could change lives.\n\nThe perspective of history does not make the fertility field look good, Hurlbut said, and the \"Wild West\" approach doesn't seem to be changing.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, for example, was introduced without the standard clinical trial process.\n\nReproductive technologies have long been a biological, social, legal and moral experiment, Hurlbut said.\n\n\"We really still do not understand the subtleties even of IVF itself, which is 45 years old this year, let alone all of the other things we've layered on top of it,\" he said.\n\nA similar nonscientific process established the hormonal regimen that women still routinely get to generate eggs for IVF, he said.\n\n\"It's a quite fundamental norm that you don't experiment on children, and yet this in vitro cultivation of a technology is also cultivation of desires and of a potential market that at the end of the day fundamentally entails experimentation on children,\" he said.\n\nPursuing this work also sends a mixed message to families that result from adoption, said Françoise Baylis, a philosopher at Dalhousie University in Canada, before the conference. Pursuing a biologically related child, regardless of the financial, scientific and ethical cost, devalues families based on other relationships, she said.\n\nReining in science\n\nThe public tends to assume scientists pursue only worthwhile research, said Katie Hasson, associate director of science for the Center for Genetics and Society, an advocacy group that argues for responsible use of genetic technology.\n\nBut once something is possible, she said, the presumption becomes \"now that we can do it, how can anyone say we should not do it?\"\n\nMeetings like last week's are intended to foster discussion before it becomes too late to stop scientific \"progress.\"\n\nMore:After years of failure, study finds hearts were 'pumping stronger' after stem cell therapy\n\nDr. Peter Marks, an official with the Food and Drug Administration, laid out the many regulatory hurdles IVG probably would face in the U.S. just to reach the stage of a clinical trial.\n\nFederal funding cannot be used for the creation of embryos, and right now, embryos can't be allowed to develop for more than 14 days in a lab, which limits the ability to test their safety, Hyun said.\n\nMany conference attendees worried aloud that other countries, perhaps with less scientific and regulatory oversight, will pursue the work first.\n\n\"There's ego and also the structure of incentives in science,\" Hasson said. \"That also feeds into arguments like 'If we don't do it, X country is going to do it, therefore we should do it first.' ... The profit potential and the push to commercialize these technologies can be a big motivation.\"\n\nTo Baylis, the question about pursuing IVG is also one of priorities.\n\n\"There are only so many scientists, so much money and time to solve dramatic problems.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nForming new friendships is important for mental well-being, my husband recently told me. He’s a therapist and shared this advice during a podcast with me about weathering pandemic stress and uncertainty.\n\nI balked, because I feel too overwhelmed by life to reach out to new people like I did in high school and college.\n\nBut I realized that I have been making friends. Over the past two years, I have mostly communicated and shared my lowest moments with a dozen fellow authors – only two of whom I have met in person.\n\nWelcome to pandemic friendships.\n\nMy author group meets regularly. We came together for professional reasons and evolved to support one another through celebration and loss. I wept when the group sent flowers and a massive box of cookies during a devastating time. How had I grown to confide deeply in people through screens? How did they see me so clearly?\n\nAnd how are others finding friendship during this isolating time? I put out a call on social media, and here are eight things I learned. Many apply regardless of your age.\n\nMovement matters\n\nThe desire to move, be outside and try different things can set the stage for new relationships.\n\nAbi Noble of Indianapolis learned how to play pickleball last summer on vacation with friends. She enjoyed the activity so much that she found outdoor classes through her town recreation department the following month, signed up and made new friends.\n\nTraditional brick-and-mortar marketing led Andrea Hendry of Seattle to friends through a fitness class for moms. “The studio had a sign that I saw when taking my kids to school,” Hendry said. “I checked it out because their classes were all outdoor and virtual.”\n\nLet furry friends lead\n\nSometimes an owner can benefit from following a dog’s lead.\n\nRan Courant-Morgan of Boston connects with fellow dog lovers on social media and has been on countless hikes with new human and canine friends during the pandemic.\n\n“Having young, energetic dogs means that we often need to be outside anyway,” Courant-Morgan shared.\n\nRan Courant-Morgan of Boston hikes with new friends, thanks to connections made on social media with fellow dog lovers. Courtesy of Ran Courant-Morgan\n\nLean into creativity\n\nCreative groups can be a source for growth and new relationships.\n\nAnn Willis of Olympia, Washington, joined a recreational mixed-level clothing design group on Facebook.\n\n“We network ideas and find inspiration and confidence to take our sewing to new levels,” Willis said.\n\nParticipation in this creative community led Willis to enter two art shows.\n\nGaming isn’t just for kids\n\nChildren aren’t the only ones finding community through gaming.\n\nAfter following up on an online opportunity to learn to play Dungeons & Dragons, Ivy Vann of Peterborough, New Hampshire, made new friends and became a social hub herself. “Because I have a big dinner table and no children living at home, my husband and I usually host,” Vann said. “I became, at age 65, the world’s oldest living D&D novice.”\n\nSusan Bingham of Waltham, Massachusetts, also connected with D&D enthusiasts online and met two families she now considers close. “We play over Zoom every week, talk on Messenger almost every day and have visited each other’s homes when Covid has allowed despite living three hours apart,” Bingham said. “I can’t imagine the last two years without them.”\n\nYour next friend may live next door\n\nMany people shared stories about connections made in their neighborhood.\n\nCurious about exploring a secondhand approach to consumables during the pandemic, Jen Cole of Gaithersburg, Maryland, joined a Buy Nothing group on Facebook and found a community of giving-minded, supportive neighbors.\n\nIn addition to social gatherings, the group has provided months of food for a member with terminal cancer and collected donations for organizations supporting refugees, people experiencing homelessness and children entering foster care.\n\nWhat started as quick check-ins and shared grocery runs with neighbors evolved into something more for Jean Hsu of Berkeley, California. Hsu started sharing the results of her baking hobby with two neighbors on her street and a cousin a few blocks away. Over time, regular gifts of homemade yogurt and ice cream, fresh fruit and pasta dishes started rotating between them. “I feel like my local community has become much stronger,” Hsu said.\n\nSupport can evolve from parenting stress\n\nNew friendships have evolved from the stress of parenting during the pandemic.\n\nSarah Ahearn Bellemare of Northampton, Massachusetts, befriended a new neighbor with whom she may not have connected before the pandemic due to the age differences of their kids. When the lockdown started, the neighbors found that their kids could easily play outside together; family walks soon followed. She made another close friend amid frustrations over remote schooling. “Texting with her about what was happening in first grade Zoom saved me.”\n\nIn addition to making new friends through neighborhood walks with her dog and baby, Elizabeth Belcher of Las Vegas made invaluable friends online through an in vitro fertilization community. “As a lesbian couple doing RIVF (reciprocal IVF), I’ve shared our story from the beginning, and being vulnerable helped others connect with us,” she said.\n\nStephanie Romanson of Winnipeg, Manitoba, found solidarity online and at the park. “I became a first-time mom in June 2020 and connected with other moms who were struggling with the isolation and missing ‘firsts’ like baby showers, birthdays and hospital visitors,” she said.\n\nLet existing groups do the work\n\nCommunities with established groups may lead you to your next friendship.\n\nAfter moving during the pandemic to be with her fiancé, Leah Dawdy of Spokane, Washington, found social connection challenging. At a friend’s encouragement, she found new friends through Bumble BFF. “It’s been nice to have my own friends,” she noted, “and to not rely on my fiancé and his schooling for a social circle.”\n\nMembership in The Lola has been key for Amy Stone of Atlanta. The club pivoted to virtual during the pandemic and is now partially back in person. “There have been lots of opportunities for shared interests like book club and self-defense class as well as professional advancement,” Stone said.\n\nWork relationships can evolve into friendships\n\nRemote work blurred the lines between work and home; many relationships have followed suit.\n\nMy colleague Heather Whaling of Columbus, Ohio, found friendship in a WhatsApp group spun off from a professional networking group. “I didn’t know any of them before Covid, and now we have a constant dialogue about hard stuff, relationships, shows, pets, life, etc.,” she said “It’s magical and helped create new connections just when I needed it most.”\n\nA virtual work introduction led to a meaningful friendship for Sarah Adkins of Cincinnati. “We started texting about our work and eventually started texting about personal things.” It was 14 months until the friends met in person; the two now spend time together regularly.\n\nFriendships have even blossomed amid the chaos of the pandemic’s front lines. Public health worker Heather Harvey of Hamilton, Ontario, found that she and many of her colleagues were deployed in different roles when the pandemic started.\n\n“I worked with some people I knew and others I didn’t. We quickly bonded over our shared circumstances, sharing laughs over instant messaging, phone chats and video calls,” Harvey said. “Many days the only thing that got me through was the support of these colleagues who became good friends.”\n\nPutting yourself out there and building new relationships can feel difficult, but if we have learned anything in the past two years, it is that we can do what’s hard. Finding a new friend may be the best hard thing you do this year.", "authors": ["Christine Koh"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/23/scientists-human-embryo/26227341/", "title": "Fears arise as Chinese modify human embryo genes", "text": "Andrew Griffin\n\nThe Independent\n\nChinese scientists have successfully edited the genes of human embryos for the first time, confirming rumors that secret genetic experiments had been happening in the country and prompting fears that the discovery could lead to a new kind of eugenics.\n\nThe researchers were able to successfully modify a specific gene responsible for a potentially fatal blood disorder. But they say that problems encountered during the testing mean that it is unlikely to be used more widely in the immediate future.\n\nThe technique could one day be used to edit out fatal and destructive genetic diseases. But others worry that it is unethical and could wreak unknown havoc on the human gene pool.\n\nUsing non-viable embryos obtained from fertility clinics, a group of scientists led by Junjiu Huang, a researcher in genetics at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, managed to inject embryos with an enzyme that can be programmed to target a specific gene. Along with another molecule that is also added to the embryo, that injection can repair or replace genes that are considered to be a problem.\n\nThe technique has been used in tests on human cells and animal embryos. But it is the first time that it is known to have been successfully tried on an embryo, and could make way for scientists to use the procedure to edit the genes of embryos used in IVF, before they are implanted.\n\n\"I believe this is the first report of CRISPR/Cas9 applied to human pre-implantation embryos and as such the study is a landmark, as well as a cautionary tale,\" George Daley, a stem-cell biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, told scientific journal Nature. \"Their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing to eradicate disease genes.\"\n\nThe team tested the procedure on 86 embryos, and gave them 48 hours to react. After that it tested 54 of the 71 surviving embryos and found that 28 had been successfully spliced.\n\nThe low success rates are likely to mean that the procedure will not be practiced on embryos that are going to be used for some time, and led to the research team calling off the study.\n\n\"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%,\" Huang told Nature. \"That's why we stopped. We still think it's too immature.\"\n\nBut the success rates could also be affected by the fact that scientists were using non-viable embryos, and critics of the study say that the efficacy rate could be wildly different with a more representative sample.\n\nThe team also found that the complex used in the procedure was also acting on other parts of the genome, leading to other bits of it mutating. That happened much more than in previous experiments on adult human cells and animal embryos — and could happen yet more if the whole genome were used, as it would be if the embryo were to be implanted.\n\nThat could mean that the procedure could end up creating new disorders, as it tries to fix old ones. Missing the target and inserting new DNA could \"create a disease of its own,\" science writer Carl Zimmer warned in a blog for National Geographic.\n\nUpdated versions of the procedure, such as tweaking the enzymes so that they are more precisely targeted, could help it be more effective. Huang says that he is pursuing such options and that he had released his data so that \"people know what really happened with this model.\"\n\nOther scientists who are less transparent and public about their experiments could easily be using the technology in more radical ways, scientists warn — and such experiments are already rumored to be happening. At least one U.S. genetics center is doing similar work but keeping it secret, MIT Technology Review said.\n\n\"The ubiquitous access to and simplicity of creating CRISPRs,\" one scientist told Nature, \"creates opportunities for scientists in any part of the world to do any kind of experiments they want.\"\n\nScientists are worried that using the technique to snip out bits of DNA that are viewed as problematic could have terrible consequences for subjects' descendants, as well as the concerns about a scientifically enabled form of eugenics. Because the alterations will be coded into the \"heritable line,\" they will be passed down to future generations — and nobody is really sure what effect that would have over time.\n\nTesting on humans steps over an ethical line about what we should be able to do to ourselves, Edward Lanphier, president of Sangamo and chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in the U.S., wrote in a comment article for Nature earlier this year.\n\n\"We are humans, not transgenic rats,\" Lanphier argued. \"We believe there is a fundamental ethical issue in crossing the boundary to modifying the human germ line.\"\n\nLanphier wrote the piece in March, when rumors of the testing in China emerged. That prompted much speculation on the dangers of changing the germ line — but the whispers hadn't been confirmed until Huang's paper was published.\n\nBut others say that the technique is more similar to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, which was rejected by many before it was shown to work and be safe.\n\nThe technology that Huang and his team used — known as CRISPR/Cas9 — is already used in some procedures. But it is only done with somatic or non-reproductive cells, like editing out certain genes that allow HIV to enter human cells.\n\nHuang said that the study was rejected by scientific journals Nature and Science, partly because of ethical objections. (Both journals declined to comment to Nature's news team.) The open-access study was instead published in Protein and Cell, under the title \"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes.\"\n\nSome are worried that the research could lead to the rise of eugenics — cutting out certain bits of DNA to design parents' perfect baby, including trivial changes like eye or hair color. Scientists are divided about whether such changes are ethically permissible, and worry that the public's concern about the same questions could lead to an outcry about the use of the technique in less significant and dangerous ways.\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Independent.

I’d been up on television at 5 a.m. and after an hour commute home, my husband and I had a chaotic dinner with our two kids followed by bath time.\n\nI was ready to collapse into bed. Just 10 more minutes of reading a bedtime story to my 2-year-old, and it would be lights out.\n\nHe had other plans.\n\nI told him I was going to run downstairs to look for his favorite stuffed animal. As I quickly glanced back, he made a strange face that felt like it was in slow motion. The next thing I knew, he was projectile vomiting everywhere.\n\nWelp, there went my night.\n\nMy husband and I hovered over him for the next 10 hours as we continually changed sheets and pajamas and fed him an electrolyte drink through a syringe to prevent him from getting dehydrated.\n\nTwo days later, my 4-year-old and I both caught his stomach virus and we were down for the count.\n\nAs strange as this may sound, and as tired as I am as I write this (because as you may already know, sleep is hard to come by in our household), what I had prayed for was this scenario. Not cleaning up vomit but rather the beautiful chaos that I live in now. And I can’t imagine life without it.\n\nCNN Entertainment Reporter Chloe Melas (second from left) is shown with her husband, Brian Mazza (far right), and their two sons. CNN/Courtesy Chloe Melas\n\nI had cried enough tears to fill a well when I learned that my husband had male factor infertility and I had low ovarian egg reserve. Fertility clinic waiting rooms with sullen faces consumed my mornings for nearly two years.\n\nPumped full of hormones, and with failed intrauterine insemination attempts and a marriage on the brink, we finally became parents thanks to in vitro fertilization, more commonly known as IVF, in 2017. I had been convinced up until this point that we would not have biological children of our own.\n\nA difficult road shared by many\n\nWhen my husband and I went public with our fertility struggles with the announcement of our pregnancy on Christmas Day 2018, we received countless messages from friends and strangers around the world sharing their journeys. Infertility felt like a dirty little secret for us and for other people, and we realized it didn’t need to be. My husband and I decided in that moment that we were going to keep talking and being transparent about what we’d been through, and it has been liberating. Over the past four years, we’ve done countless podcasts, written numerous articles and appeared on panels.\n\nTo bring attention to male factor infertility, my husband started a fundraiser called Run for a Chance in 2021. He ran 50 miles across Westchester County in New York and raised over $80,000 to cover fertility treatments for individuals at the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine of Weill Cornell Medicine, where we went through IVF to have our children.\n\nMazza (far left), has raised awareness of male factor infertility by starting the Run for a Chance fundraiser in 2021. Chloe Melas\n\nFundraising is essential, since one round of IVF in the United States can cost upward of $12,000 – not including medication, according to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital.\n\nIn the United States, only 19 states require some level of insurance coverage for infertility, according to the national infertility association Resolve. That means that in the other 31 states, insurance companies in the fully insured market (when a company purchases a plan from a commercial insurance carrier) don’t have to offer fertility benefits.\n\nFind your resolve for an uphill battle\n\nI totally get it – the logistical hurdles can seem insurmountable at times. But in response to the one question I get on a nearly weekly basis from people struggling to create their families, I always give the same answer: Don’t give up.\n\nI wasn’t happy with my first fertility clinic, so I found my way to Dr. David Reichman at Weill Cornell Medical College. I always tell people to advocate for themselves – and if something doesn’t feel right, then find something that does.\n\nBut it didn’t get better right away. Up until we had our first successful round of IVF, two years into the process, I felt sick over every baby shower invitation. I found even running errands to be devastating as every pregnant woman made me sick with envy. Yet although I felt broken, I didn’t let it break me. I kept waking up each morning and making a conscious effort to develop a new plan each time things didn’t go our way.\n\nI wish at the time I knew about places that could have brought me some sense of community during this difficult period of my life. Now I’m involved with organizations like Resolve: The National Infertility Association, that provide state by state guidance and support groups.\n\n(Back row, from left) Melas and Mazza continue to share their infertility journey publicly so others going through it don't feel alone. Chloe Melas\n\nI know that not all journeys will result in a baby, and they might not result in a baby that you give birth to yourself. But I hope you come to an answer that is right for you, whether it’s adoption, surrogacy, or egg or sperm donation. You don’t know what is ultimately going to happen, but you won’t know if you don’t try. I know it’s painfully hard, and sometimes you don’t even want to get out of bed.

All it took was stem cells.\n\nStem cells are unspecialized cells that can be manipulated into becoming mature cells with special functions.\n\n“Our mouse embryo model not only develops a brain, but also a beating heart, all the components that go on to make up the body,” said lead study author Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem cell biology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.\n\n“It’s just unbelievable that we’ve got this far. This has been the dream of our community for years, and a major focus of our work for a decade, and finally we’ve done it.”\n\nThe paper is an exciting advance and tackles a challenge scientists face studying mammal embryos in utero, said Marianne Bronner, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (Caltech). Bronner was not involved in the study.\n\n“These develop outside of the mother and therefore can be easily visualized through critical developmental stages that were previously difficult to access,” Bronner added.\n\nThe researchers hope to move from mouse embryos to creating models of natural human pregnancies – many of which fail in the early stages, Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nBy watching the embryos in a lab instead of a uterus, scientists got a better view into the process to learn why some pregnancies might fail and how to prevent it, she added.\n\nFor now, researchers have only been able to track about eight days of development in the mouse synthetic embryos, but the process is improving, and they are already learning a lot, said study author Gianluca Amadei, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge.\n\n“It reveals the fundamental requirements that have to be fulfilled to make the right structure of the embryo with its organs,” Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nWhere it stands, the research doesn’t apply to humans and “there needs to be a high degree of improvement for this to be truly useful,” said Benoit Bruneau, the director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes. Bruneau was not involved in the study.\n\nBut researchers see important uses for the future. The process can be used immediately to test new drugs, Zernicka-Goetz said. But in the longer term, as scientists move from mouse synthetic embryos to a human embryo model, it also could help build synthetic organs for people who need transplants, Zernicka-Goetz added.\n\n“I see this work as being the first example of work of this kind,” said study author David Glover, research professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech.\n\nHow they did it\n\nIn utero, an embryo needs three types of stem cells to form: One becomes the body tissue, another the sac where the embryo develops, and the third the placenta connecting parent and fetus, according to the study.\n\nIn Zernicka-Goetz’s lab, researchers isolated the three types of stem cells from embryos and cultured them in a container angled to bring the cells together and encourage crosstalk between them.\n\nDay by day, they were able to see the group of cells form into a more and more complex structure, she said.\n\nThere are ethical and legal considerations to address before moving to human synthetic embryos, Zernicka-Goetz said. And with the difference in complexity between mouse and human embryos, it could be decades before researchers are able to do a similar process for human models, Bronner said.\n\nBut in the meantime, the information learned from the mouse models could help “correct failing tissues and organs,” Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nThe mystery of human life\n\nThe early weeks after fertilization are made up of these three different stem cells communicating with one another chemically and mechanically so the embryo can grow properly, the study said.\n\n“So many pregnancies fail around this time, before most women (realize) they are pregnant,” said Zernicka-Goetz, who is also professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech. “This period is the foundation for everything else that follows in pregnancy. If it goes wrong, the pregnancy will fail.”\n\nBut by this stage, an embryo created through in vitro fertilization is already implanted in the parent, so scientists have limited visibility into the processes it is going through, Zernicka-Goetz said.\n\nThey were able to develop foundations of a brain – a first for models such as these and a “holy grail for the field,” Glover said.\n\n“This period of human life is so mysterious, so to be able to see how it happens in a dish – to have access to these individual stem cells, to understand why so many pregnancies fail and how we might be able to prevent that from happening – is quite special,” Zernicka-Goetz said in a press release. “We looked at the dialogue that has to happen between the different types of stem cell at that time – we’ve shown how it occurs and how it can go wrong.”", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/09/06/oldest-woman-to-ever-give-birth-has-twins-at-74-years-old/2231598001/", "title": "74-year-old reportedly has twins, may be oldest to ever give birth", "text": "A 74-year-old woman from southern India has given birth to her first children, twin girls, Thursday, possibly becoming the oldest woman ever to give birth, local outlets report.\n\nMangayamma Yaramati opted for in vitro fertilization after years of being unable to conceive, reported the Times of India.

She's gone from medical marvel — hers are the only known full set of octuplets to live past their first week — to national punch line for her various money-generating efforts\n\nThe 38-year-old single mother of 14 children (she had six before the octuplets) has been a porn actress, nude model, celebrity boxer and birth-control pitchwoman as she's struggled to support herself and her children. She's lost a home to foreclosure, teetered on the brink of bankruptcy and fought with nannies and others who tried to help her, leaving in her wake a string of publicists, lawyers and good-Samaritan types who no longer want to talk about her.\n\nSuleman was back in the headlines earlier this month when she was charged with welfare fraud. She pleaded not guilty and is free on her own recognizance pending a pretrial hearing next month.\n\nDespite all the attention she's generated, Suleman has kept her octuplets largely out of the public eye and shared little about them. As they turn 5, here are eight things to know about \"Octomom:\"\n\n1) BEFORE SHE WAS OCTOMOM: Suleman worked for a state mental hospital in 1999 when she said she suffered a back injury during an inmate riot. She went on to collect more than $165,000 in disability payments and used some of the money to help pay for in-vitro fertilization treatments that produced her first six children. She has a bachelor's degree in child and adolescent development from California State University, Fullerton, and was studying for a master's in counseling when she became pregnant with the octuplets.\n\n2) THE DOCTOR: All 14 of Suleman's children were born through IVF treatments provided by Beverly Hills physician Dr. Michael Kamrava. He faced harsh criticism when it was learned he implanted 12 embryos that resulted in the octuplets. Medical guidelines recommend no more than two embryos. Kamrava said he was trying to please an insistent patient. The California Medical Board revoked his license, citing gross negligence.\n\n3) NAME GAMES: Suleman picked Biblical names for all eight of her octuplets: Noah, Jonah, Jeremiah, Josiah, Isaiah, Makai, Nariyah and Maliyah. All have the same middle name, Angel. No explanation was given for why Suleman chose to spell their last names Solomon. But then no explanation was given for why she altered her own first name from Natalie to Nadya, something discovered only this month when she was charged.\n\n4) SHE SUPPORTS BIRTH CONTROL — FOR DOGS AND CATS: In 2010 People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals paid Suleman $5,000 to endorse spaying and neutering for pets. The organization also provided a month's supply of vegetarian hot dogs and hamburgers.\n\n5) CELEBRITY BOXING STAR: Suleman launched a short-lived boxing career in 2011, explaining she was stepping into the ring with a string of D-List celebrities because she was broke. Her opponents included \"Long Island Lolita\" Amy Fisher, who became famous for shooting her much older lover's wife in the face in 1992. Suleman won decisions over Fisher and a Florida bartender, but took a pounding from Philadelphia radio personality Jen Posner, though the referee ruled the bout a draw.\n\n6) ON THE MOVE: The house Suleman bought after the birth of her octuplets was put on the auction block in 2012 after she defaulted on a loan. She tried to save it by filing for bankruptcy but a judge dismissed the case when she never completed the paperwork. She has gone on to live in rental houses.\n\n7) AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS: Suleman's porn video, \"Octomom Home Alone,\" won the 2013 AVN Award for Best Celebrity Sex Tape, the adult film industry's equivalent of an Oscar.\n\n8) WHO'S THE FATHER? Suleman, who was married from 1996 to 2008, has never publicly identified the father of any of her children. She has said it wasn't her ex-husband, but a friend who donated the sperm used to create the 60 embryos that authorities say Kamrava implanted in her over the years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/24"}]}

As an incentive to resign, they were offered eight months of pay and benefits through September. They had barely more than one week to make a life-changing decision.\n\n\"It was a shock. Are they trying to get rid of us?\" said Linda Ward-Smith, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs and president of her local union chapter in Las Vegas, of the sudden buyout offer. \"A lot of my members are afraid and unsure because they they're like, if we don't take this, are they going to fire us? Or is it just going to get really hard for us to continue?\"\n\n\"I see it as a veiled threat,\" added a 25-year veteran of the federal government, who like other federal employees quoted in this story, was granted anonymity by USA TODAY to speak about their concerns out of fear of retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\"You've got two choices. That's it. There's no hindrance, there's no legal room. It's either you're with us or you're against us,\" said the worker, who is not taking the buyout but said their fellow federal employees are \"walking on eggshells.\"\n\nMore:What to know after federal judge pauses Trump's buyout deadline for federal workers\n\nMore:Donald Trump offers eight-month buyouts to all federal employees\n\nTrump has spent his first two-plus weeks in office taking a wrecking ball to the federal workforce in a push to dramatically shrink the size of the government and replace bureaucrats his team has perceived as hostile to his agenda with loyalists.\n\n\"Everybody's replaceable, and we'll get very good people to replace them if it turns out to be more than we thought,\" Trump said last month of the buyout plan, which the White House calls \"deferred resignations.\"\n\nSome might take buyout 'out of fear'\n\nAt the center of the dismantling is tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, the world's richest man who Trump has empowered to lead the government makeover through his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has talked about savings of $4 billion a day by the start of fiscal year 2026 in September.\n\nAs the buyout deadline arrives, many federal workers told USA TODAY that they don't trust the promised severance pay and benefits will be delivered if they take the offer. Democratic lawmakers have warned them to turn it down, arguing Trump's buyout is illegal.\n\nYet some federal workers wonder whether they could be laid off if they don't take the offer as Trump seeks to rapidly downsize federal departments and agencies. An OPM memo Tuesday warned federal employees could be furloughed if they do not accept the buyout and that “the majority of federal agencies will be downsized,” with the Defense Department as an exception.\n\n\"It pissed me off, more than anything else,\" a 27-year-old federal worker said while protesting the plan Monday outside the Washington headquarters of the OPM. She said the offer \"ignores all the work that we do day in and day out, on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n\"I built my career around serving the American people. I intend to keep doing that,\" the worker said.\n\nMore:'Fork off': Protesters gather outside OPM to condemn Elon Musk 'stealing' personal data\n\nThe decision-making is “flat-out nerve-racking,” said a 41-year-old federal analyst who lives near Salt Lake City, Utah.

Musk and his aides have assumed control of federal IT infrastructure as his team swiftly blitzes through departments and agencies. Trump, with Musk's guidance, this week gutted the United States Agency for International Development and merged it into the State Department. The president has signaled he might try to eliminate the Department of Education by executive order next.\n\n\"They're putting a shot across the administrative state's bow,\" Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, said last week of the mass federal buyout plan on his \"War Room\" podcast. \"That's DOGE signaling to you that they've got a plan of how to take the personnel down.\"\n\n\"Fork in the Road\" is the same subject line Musk used in 2022 when he gave employees of Twitter a similar ultimatum after buying the social media company and later changing its name to X. Twitter's staff was rapidly downsized by about 80%.\n\nFederal employees who want to remain in the federal workforce were told in the \"Fork in the Road\" email they must return to in-person work, embrace new \"performance standards\" and be \"reliable, loyal and trustworthy\" in their work. The email also warned that most federal departments and agencies will be \"downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the buyout offer was extended to nearly all employees of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nSome federal employees said they were alarmed at the short timeframe they were given to make their decisions.\n\n\"I have invested way too much time and energy and interest into my career to just say, 'hell with it' and leave when I only have, like, five to 10 years left before I retire,\" one federal worker said.\n\n\"I'm not taking the the resigning bait.

About 60,000 federal workers had accepted the offer as of Thursday afternoon, according to NBC News\n\nA White House official said the number of accepted buyouts is \"rapidly growing,\" and the White House expects the largest spike in sign-ups to come in the final 24 hours before the deadline.\n\n“It’s getting scary and it’s tough to tell people to hold the line,” the federal analyst from Salt Lake City said. “As of today, my answer is no, but then I don’t know what kind of information I will get that may change my mind.”\n\nMore:At least 20,000 federal workers have taken Trump's buyout offer as deadline nears\n\nLayoffs across the federal government are \"likely\" if not enough employees take the buyout, Erv Koehler, assistant commissioner of general supplies and services at General Services Administration, said in an email to GSA staff reported Tuesday by the Washington Post.\n\n“Please know that I empathize with the tough decisions you each are having to make,” wrote Erv Koehler said in the email. “Please focus on making the best decision for you and your particular situation.”\n\nDemocrats have warned federal workers not to trust the offer. “Don’t be fooled,\" U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said from the Senate floor last week. He compared the buyout to past Trump business ventures that failed. \"He’s tricked hundreds of people with that offer. If you accept that offer and resign, he’ll stiff you just like he stiffed the contractors.\"\n\nThe initial \"Fork in the Road\" email caused confusion by its wording because it didn't explicitly say that federal workers won't be expected to work through September if they accept the \"deferred resignation\" offer.\n\nMore:Almost all USAID workers across the globe placed on leave as Trump moves to gut agency\n\nIn a follow-up email titled \"Fork in the Road FAQs,\" the OPM clarified employees are not expected to work during the deferred resignation period and can accept a job elsewhere while still getting paid through September.\n\n\"We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to,\" the email reads. \"The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nLawsuit from federal employees union\n\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 federal workers, questioned the validity of the buyout program, noting that Congress did not authorize funds for it.\n\nThe AFGE union sued the Trump administration in Massachusetts federal court Tuesday seeking to overturn the buyout, arguing the Trump administration lacks any statutory basis for the \"unprecedented offer\" and can't authorize buyout payments through September when Congress hasn't appropriated funding past March 14.\n\nTwo other government employees unions joined the lawsuit, and the judge overseeing the case on Thursday afternoon temporary blocked the buyouts, suspending the deadline until at least Monday, when a hearing has been set.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement saying U.S. District Judge George O'Toole's delay will allow more federal workers to take part in the buyout.\n\n\"We are grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the Administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer,\" Leavitt said.\n\nEverett said federal workers are feeling uneasy and nervous, and believes the broader plan by the Trump administration is to privatize a host of government services.\n\n\"He's trying to get rid of federal employees to make it easier for the government to fail, so that he can contract out those jobs because they got to be done,\" Kelley said. \"The federal government's got to issue Social Security checks, right? They got to take care of veterans. And so what he trying to do is make it so corrupt that it fails.\"\n\nThe buyout plan for federal employees reflects the enormous power Musk exerts over Trump's federal government. Musk and his aides have taken over the OPM. The executive order that created DOGE instructed department heads to give the new agency \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.\"\n\nMusk and his aides have gained access to Treasury Department human resources computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees. Reuters reported career civil servants have been locked out of these systems.\n\nMore:Musk creates new power base in Washington with takeover of US agencies\n\nMusk previewed his efforts to slash the federal workforce in a Wall Street Journal op-ed two weeks after Trump's election victory in November. He argued the president has broad executive authority to carry out \"large-scale firings\" of federal employees, who won't be needed as Trump pursues \"a drastic reduction in federal regulations.\"\n\nFederal workers prepare for 'a day of fallout'\n\nTrump has characterized many federal workers as lazy.\n\n\"Some haven't worked, and most of the studies say that some have just gone through the motions,\" Trump said last week. \"We may ask these people to prove that they didn't have another job during their so-called employment with the United States of America.\"\n\nTop Trump officials have alleged most federal workforce are aligned with Democrats despite laws that forbids public employees from engaging in politics in their public positions.\n\n\"There are 2 million employees in the federal government. Overwhelmingly, the career federal service in this country is far left, left-wing,\" Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said in a recent interview on CNN. \"The American people voted for dramatic change implemented by Donald Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some federal workers, including a senior analyst in the Education Department, don’t have the option of taking the deal. He was placed on administrative leave late Friday, but wasn't informed until this week.\n\n“I lost access and was completely cut off from my work email, and files,” said the analyst who’s based in Florida. “My account was disabled.”\n\nThe analyst, who helps train presidents, chancellors and chief financial officers at more than 400 institutions nationwide ranging from Harvard to Howard universities achieve Title IV compliance, said he had to find out from his colleagues about his status and the fate of his workload.\n\n“I can’t do anything further,” he said. “This will have a huge effect on the schools and the students they serve. Whether they can continue that training or if my colleagues pick up or it stops where it is uncertain.”\n\nThe 42-year-old federal worker who has been in his analyst position for more than a decade, said he was among 60 federal workers in his agency put on administrative leave as the Trump administration seeks to dismantle the Education Department.\n\n“I’m in limbo. I’m wondering if I should be looking for another job or not,” the analyst said. “This impacts my longevity and my salary potential. But I’m going to lean into my spirituality as God has prepared me for this moment to have the discipline and strength to handle this situation.”\n\nHe knows some of his colleagues are considering taking the deferred resignation offer, but “a lot of them are leery of it because it might give up some of the civil service rights they have, like the ability to sue.”\n\nSpeaking to USA TODAY before the judge paused the buyout offer, he predicted Friday would be “a day of fallout” as they see who did or did not take the resignations.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.

The \"deferred resignation program\" would allow federal employees to remain on the payroll through Sept. 30 but without having to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated in the meantime, according to an email sent to federal employees.\n\nThe email gives federal employees until Feb. 6 to decide whether to take part. It instructed interested employees to reply to the email from a government account and type the word \"resign.\"\n\nFederal worker unions have urged employees not to take the offer, and many civil servants have expressed anger and defiance over the email.\n\nFunding freeze\n\nThe Trump administration issued a memo pausing potentially trillions of dollars in federal aid, sowing chaos throughout the government and stirring fears that it would disrupt thousands of federal grant programs that serve tens of millions of Americans.\n\nOn Monday night, a federal judge temporarily halted the directive after several advocacy groups argued that the freeze would devastate programs ranging from health care to road construction.\n\nThe Trump administration faces another legal challenge from Democratic state attorneys general. In a separate lawsuit, they argue that the freeze violates the U.S. Constitution and would have a devastating effect on states that rely on federal aid for a substantial portion of their budgets.\n\nGovernment watchdogs\n\nTrump has fired 17 inspectors general at multiple government agencies, a move that clears the way to replace independent watchdogs with loyalists.\n\nThe inspectors general at agencies, including the departments of State, Defense and Transportation were notified by emails from the White House personnel director that they had been terminated immediately.\n\nThe dismissals appeared to violate federal law because the U.S. Congress was not given a 30-day notice nor a reason for the firings, the independent Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency said in a letter to the White House.\n\nCutting the size of the federal workforce\n\nTrump ordered federal workers back to the office full-time and agencies to take steps to halt remote work arrangements.\n\nHe issued a freeze on federal hiring, except for military, immigration enforcement, national security and public safety jobs.\n\nHe reinstated his first-term Schedule F executive order, which would strip potentially hundreds of thousands of government workers of employment protections and make them easier to fire.\n\nIn a memo from the acting director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, agency heads were asked to identify employees on probationary periods, or who have served less than two years. Such employees are easier to fire.\n\nChanging the mission at key agencies\n\nAbout 20 senior career attorneys at the Justice Department, including environmental, criminal, national security, civil rights lawyers, and some immigration court staff, have been reassigned.\n\nSome of those have been sent to a newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group, as Trump tries to stop state and city government officials from resisting his plans to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nThe Justice Department has also ordered prosecutors to consider pursuing criminal cases against state and local officials who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nThe department also issued a freeze on new civil rights litigation.\n\nThe Trump administration has halted all pending environmental litigation, according to two sources familiar with the matter and a pair of memos seen by Reuters.\n\nAt the U.S. State Department, a \"stop-work\" order was issued for all existing foreign assistance. Waivers were issued for military financing for Israel and Egypt.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump ordered a 90-day pause in foreign development assistance pending assessments of efficiencies and consistency with his foreign policy.\n\nAt the National Security Council (NSC), 160 staff members have been sent home.\n\nReview of FEMA\n\nTrump has ordered a review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as he considers whether to close or reshape the country's lead federal disaster response agency.\n\nTrump has accused FEMA of bungling emergency relief efforts and said he preferred that states be given federal money to handle disasters themselves. Democrats and other critics say he is politicizing disaster relief aid.\n\nFirings\n\nTrump says he plans to fire over 1,000 officials appointed by his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nOn his first full day in office, the heads of the U.S. Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration were fired along with other officials.\n\nCoast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Lee Fagan, the first female uniformed leader of an armed forces branch, was removed in part for what a Department of Homeland Security official said was her excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.\n\nGovernment diversity programs\n\nTrump signed an order calling for the elimination of government diversity programs.

How ...", "text": "A federal judge has issued a temporary pause on the deadline for federal employees to decide by the end of Thursday whether to resign or keep their jobs under the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered a buyout offer to federal employees as part of a push to reduce the federal workforce. More than 2 million civil federal employees across the U.S. had about a week to consider an eight-month buyout, which the White House is calling \"deferred resignations.\"\n\nAn email sent this week also warned that civil-service protections will be stripped and those who stay might be subjected to loyalty tests.\n\nIn total, there are about 2.3 million federal employees. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management initially sent a memo on Tuesday, Jan. 28, outlining the eight-month buyout offer. The newest email was a reminder of the deadline.\n\nHow many workers could that affect in Alabama? Here's what you need to know about how many federal workers are in Alabama.\n\nWhen will the court decide if the buyouts can go forward?\n\nU.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. issued a temporary restraining order at a hearing on Thursday, Feb. 6 and set a hearing for Monday, Feb. 10.\n\nThree unions filed a lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court. They argue there's no legal basis for it and the deals would authorize payments past the date Congress has already appropriated money.\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers said extending the deadline could “markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the administration’s efforts to reform the federal workforce.”\n\nThis does not mean the buyouts are canceled, only delayed at this point.\n\nWhat is the buyout offer for federal workers?\n\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management sent the email to employees on Tuesday, Jan. 28. The email was titled \"Fork in the Road,\" like the one one Elon Musk sent Twitter employees in 2022.\n\nWorkers in civilian roles who accept could get pay and benefits through Sept. 30.\n\nTaking the buyout would exempt workers from a previous return to office plan that Trump outlined in an executive order. More than 228,000 federal workers log in via telework across the country, and Trump previously announced plans to fire those who didn't come back to the office five days a week. The remote work plan implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is still in effect for many employees.\n\nWhen is the deadline?\n\nThe deadline is 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 6.\n\nWhen will the court decide if the buyouts can go forward?\n\nThree unions asked a federal court in Massachusetts to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the buyout.\n\nThey argue there's no legal basis for it and the deals would authorize payments past the date Congress has already appropriated money.\n\nA hearing was at 1 p.m. ET Thursday before U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr.\n\nHow many have taken the deal?\n\nAccording to Reuters, about 40,000 had taken the offer as of this week.\n\nThe White House previously said the goal was for 5% to 10% reduction through buyouts.\n\nWill federal employees who take the buyout keep working?\n\nNo. The OPM clarified in an email that employees who take the deal will get full pay and benefits but not be required to work through September.\n\nIs it safe to take the deal?\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees and National Federation of Federal Employees -- two unions that represent federal workers -- have warned against taking the offer because they might not be paid.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James and at least 10 other states' attorneys general, have said the offers can't be trusted.\n\n“These supposed offers are not guaranteed,” James said in a statement. “Federal employees should be cautious and follow the guidance of their unions to protect their rights.”\n\nAccording to reporting from NBC, U.S. Department of Education workers were told in a meeting this week that the education secretary might later revoke the buyout if they take it, leaving them without pay or benefits.\n\nWill there be furloughs? What about layoffs?\n\nThe first \"Fork in the Road\" email said offices will be consolidated and possibly moved and some agencies or military branches will see staffing increases, but most \"are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force.\" Employees might be furloughed or changed to at-will status.\n\n\"At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions,\" it reads.\n\nThe newest OPM email -- called \"Fork in the Road Reminder\" -- reiterated that most agencies will be reduced, other than the Department of Defense, and furloughs are possible.\n\nHow many federal employees are there in Alabama?\n\nThere are 40,692 federal civilian employees in Alabama as of March 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. That doesn't include uniformed military personnel or federal contractors.\n\nA House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform report published on Jan. 15 relied on OMB figures. It said about 43% of employees were still teleworking as of September 2023. Using those numbers, an estimated 17,498 federal workers in Alabama could be affected by an executive order ordering that they all return to the office five days a week.\n\nWho can take the buyout?\n\nAccording to the OPM memo, deferred resignation is available for all full-time employees except:\n\nMilitary personnel in the armed forces.\n\nU.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nNational security and immigration workers.\n\nAnyone in positions excluded by the employing agency.\n\nFederal employment guidelines state that severance pay can go to people who worked at least 12 months of continuous service.\n\nWhat does Trump plan to cut, reorganize?\n\nMore federal jobs could also be at risk, depending on planned department closures and proposed reorganizations.\n\nThe federal government spent $6.75 trillion dollars in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nTrump has tapped Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Initially, Musk said they could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. However, that estimate has been downgraded to close to $1 trillion. (Multiple lawsuits have been filed, arguing for transparency from the commission, and reports say Ramaswamy will step away soon to run for governor of Ohio.)\n\nMusk, along with a flock of young engineers, has been taking over federal department infrastructure over the past week. Notably, he bragged about \"feeding USAID into the wood chipper\" over the weekend and deleting IRS Direct File, a way for people to submit their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service for Free.\n\nTrump recently announced plans to change or eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying he wanted to see individual states lead disaster response.\n\nHe also working to close the Department of Education and revamp Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice.\n\nProject 2025, a conservative playbook developed by the Heritage Foundation, calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to totally dismantled because of its work on climate change being \"harmful to future U.S. prosperity.\" The group wants some functions eliminated or moved to other departments and the National Weather Service to charge for its data-gathering services.\n\nTrump distanced himself from Project 2025, but 31 of the 38 authors had ties to the president or his former administration, and he's chosen several authors for key roles in his new administration.\n\nStory continues below video.\n\nOPM memo lists changes planned for federal workforce\n\nThe OPM said Trump-led changes to the federal workforce for remaining employees will include:\n\nEmployees return to in-person work.\n\nRestored accountability for employees who have policy-making authority.\n\nRestored accountability for senior career executives.\n\nReformed the federal hiring process to focus on merit.\n\n\"As a result of the above orders, the reform of the federal workforce will be significant,\" the memo said.\n\nSee the 4 pillars of 'reformed federal workforce'\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management outlined \"four pillars\" of the \"reformed federal workforce\":\n\n\" Return to office: The substantial majority of federal employees who have been working remotely since Covid will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMusk's efforts are part of a massive government restructuring by Trump, who has fired and sidelined hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists.\n\nAmericans are witnessing \"an extraordinary centralization of power in someone who lacks a top-level security clearance and has not been subject to any Senate confirmation process,\" said Don Moynihan, a professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Musk has unprecedented and centralized control of the basic plumbing of government,\" he added.\n\nNonetheless, Musk operates at Trump's pleasure. The president told reporters on Monday that the billionaire had to seek approval from the White House for any of his actions.\n\n\"Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval, and we'll give him the approval, where appropriate; where not appropriate, we won't. But he reports in.\"\n\nAsked who they are more worried about when it comes to the prospect of being fired, an employee of the General Services Administration that manages federal property and services said: \"Musk. No one is really talking about Trump.\"\n\nDOGE cuts:Elon Musk says he 'deleted' IRS Direct File. Can taxpayers still use the free service?\n\nTrump has put Musk in charge of what both men call the Department of Government Efficiency. Despite its name, it is not a department, Musk does not draw a government salary, and DOGE's creation immediately drew lawsuits from government unions, watchdogs and public interest groups.\n\nExactly who makes up DOGE is unclear. The Trump administration has not released a list of DOGE employees. Nor has it said how they are being paid, how many have entered each agency, and whether they are government workers. That raises questions about who they are answerable to - Musk or Trump as head of the executive branch.\n\nMusk and his DOGE lieutenants have taken over the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration along with their computer systems.\n\nOPM is the human resources arm of the U.S. government, overseeing 2.2 million government workers. From there, emails have been sent out in the past week offering federal employees financial incentives to quit. The GSA oversees most government contracts and manages federal property.\n\nAt least four current and former Musk aides are part of a team that has taken over OPM, shutting out some senior managers from their own computer systems, sources told Reuters. Musk visited the GSA last Thursday, an official said, while members of his team moved into the agency.\n\nOn Friday, a Musk team gained access to the U.S. Treasury Department's payment system, which sends out more than $6 trillion a year on behalf of federal agencies and contains the personal information of millions of Americans who receive Social Security payments, tax refunds and other monies from government.\n\nMichael Linden, a senior official during the administration of former President Joe Biden at the Office of Management and Budget, a powerful agency that oversees the federal budget, said the access by Musk's aides to payment systems gives them extraordinary potential power.\n\n\"They could get to pick and choose which payments the federal government makes,\" Linden said in an interview.\n\nNeither Musk nor the White House immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that the federal bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and needs to be downsized. He also accuses many federal workers of being liberal ideologues out to thwart his agenda.\n\nMusk exceeding his authority\n\n\"Those of us who have worked at Elon's companies can see his fingerprints all over what's happening inside the federal government right now,\" said Thomas Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer. \"It's a very seat-of-the-pants affair with Elon's loyalists scrambling to execute his every whim and desire as fast as possible.\"\n\nGovernance experts say Musk appears to have already gone beyond the mandate granted by the executive order Trump signed setting up DOGE on Jan. 20.\n\nThat order mandated it to modernize federal technology and software \"to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\" Other orders on hiring freezes and recruitment say DOGE should work with other agencies to make recommendations.\n\nMusk and his aides appear to be doing much more than simply making recommendations.\n\nEmployees from DOGE have clashed with security officials over access to sensitive information at the Washington headquarters of USAID and have been heavily involved in the downsizing of the agency.\n\nRead more Musk:Morgan Stanley to increase sale of loans tied to Musk's X, Bloomberg News reports\n\nFear is gripping many civil servants, and they have taken to Reddit, Signal and Facebook to report on what is going on inside their agencies and discuss how to respond. They also warn that DOGE personnel are watermarking and otherwise embedding identifiers like additional spacing in emails to track down suspected leakers.\n\nMusk's critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have accused him of a hostile takeover of government. Federal worker unions sued to block Musk's access to sensitive computer systems.\n\n\"We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,\" U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, told reporters during a protest outside USAID headquarters.\n\n'Fork in the road'\n\nEchoing language Musk used when he slashed Twitter's workforce after buying the social media company in 2022, an email was sent to all government employees titled \"Fork in the Road\" offering them deferred resignation, a scheme to pay workers through September if they offered to resign by Feb. 6.\n\nA second email encouraged government workers to seek more productive jobs in the private sector. Federal employee unions have urged workers not to take the offer, warning it may not be legal, as it is unclear how the payoffs would be funded.\n\nUnions representing the employees filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to block the administration's plan to offer buyouts, even as a U.S. official told Reuters that more than 20,000 employees were planning on quitting.\n\nNick Bednar, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said it was deeply concerning that Musk and his aides have such enormous power over federal personnel and federal payments \"when they seemingly have very little accountability.\"\n\nIt was also extraordinary that Musk, whose companies have multiple contracts with the U.S. government, had been put in a position that would raise so many questions about conflicts of interest, he said.\n\nReporting by Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay and Susan Heavey; Editing by Ross Colvin and Howard Goller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/05/trump-take-over-gaza-the-excerpt/78244928007/", "title": "Trump says US should take over Gaza | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/31/plane-collides-helicopter-crashes-river-the-excerpt/78061601007/", "title": "Plane collides with helicopter, crashes into DC river | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}]}

The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the trade is official.\n\nThe Knicks plan to send Julius Randle, Donte DiVincenzo and a first-round pick to the Timberwolves as part of the blockbuster trade just as training camps are getting ready to open for most teams.\n\nThe Knicks will also trade DaQuan Jeffries to Charlotte.\n\nNew York is intent on competing with the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics for the Eastern Conference title. The Knicks have not been to the Finals since 2000 and have not won a title since 1973.\n\nLast season, they were 50-32, led by All-Star Jalen Brunson. But injuries derailed their playoffs, and they lost to Indiana in the conference semifinals.\n\nGrading the trade for the Knicks\n\nThe Knicks get a formidable big man in Towns, who is a four-time All-Star, including last season, and averaged 21.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and shot 50.4% from the field, a career-high 41.6% on 3-pointers and 87.3% on free throws.\n\nFor Towns, this is a return home. He was born in Edison, New Jersey, and played high school basketball at St. Joseph in nearby Metuchen, New Jersey.

The Timberwolves won 56 games last season, second most in franchise history, and lost to Dallas in the Western Conference finals.\n\nIn the big picture, the Timberwolves move off of Towns’ contract, which has four years and $220.4 million remaining on it, and get Randle, who can become a free agent after next season or pick up his player option at $30.9 million for 2025-26. Either way, it’s financial relief for the Timberwolves, who plan to lower their luxury tax bill.\n\nRandle averaged 24.0 points, 9.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists last season but played in just 46 regular-season games and missed the playoffs with a dislocated right shoulder.\n\nDiVincenzo has developed into a solid contributor and 3-point shooter, averaging 15.5 points and shooting 40.1% on 3s in 2023-24.\n\nGrade: C\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/02/06/nba-trade-deadline-tracker-2023-kyrie-irving/11192581002/", "title": "NBA trade deadline tracker: Kevin Durant moved in blockbuster", "text": "Star guard Kyrie Irving threw the NBA trade deadline into chaos on Friday with his request to be moved from the Brooklyn Nets to another team before Thursday’s deadline.\n\nThe Nets didn't wait long to trade the sought-after All-Star.

The Raptors drafted Poeltl, 27, with the ninth overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft and he played two seasons with the Raptors before he was traded to the Spurs as part of the deal that sent Kawhi Leonard to Toronto.\n\nKnicks trade Cam Reddish for Josh Hart\n\nFeb. 8: The New York Knicks are trading for shooting guard Josh Hart. In exchange the Knicks are sending small forward Cam Reddish and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers, according to ESPN.\n\nLakers trade Russell Westbrook, acquire D'Angelo Russell\n\nFeb. 8: In a three-team trade, the Los Angeles Lakers reached a deal to trade guard Russell Westbrook to the Utah Jazz and acquire guard D’Angelo Russell from Minnesota in a deal that also includes Utah sending guard Mike Conley to the Timberwolves. The Lakers will also get Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt from Utah. Minnesota also will receive Nickeil Alexander-Walker and picks, and the Jazz will get Juan Toscano-Anderson and a first-round draft pick from the Lakers.\n\nKings trade for Kessler Edwards\n\nFeb. 7: The Brooklyn Nets acquired the draft rights to David Michineau (39th pick in the 2016 draft) from the Sacramento Kings for forward Kessler Edwards and cash considerations.\n\nSpurs acquire Dewayne Dedmon from Heat\n\nFeb. 7: The Miami Heat traded center Dewayne Dedmon and a 2028 second-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for cash considerations.

The Jazz will acquire Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round pick from the Lakers and a 2025 second-round pick from the Mavericks.\n\nThe stunning deal comes ahead of Thursday’s trade deadline as the Lakers and Mavericks try to bolster their roster for a deep playoff run. The Mavericks lost to the Boston Celtics in last season’s Finals, and the Lakers lost in the first round to Denver after losing to Denver in the 2023 Western Conference finals.\n\nThe magnitude of the trade – both are on a Hall of Fame trajectory, both are All-NBA players and Doncic could end up a multi-time MVP – skew the optics of the deal in the moment.\n\nGrading the Lakers-Mavericks trade:\n\nMavericks trade grade: B-\n\nLet’s start with this: trading a 25-year-old star, not yet in his prime, who is already a five-time All-NBA selection and led the franchise to the Finals in 2023-24 is bold and risky. The Mavs parted ways with one of the NBA’s most gifted offensive players who finished third in MVP voting last season and is close to being a 30-point per game triple-double player.\n\nThere’s a lot riding on this trade for the Mavs. Comments from GM Nico Harrison about defense winning championships suggested the Mavericks didn't think they could win a title with Doncic’s defense. Is Doncic’s defense that bad? Was it worth giving up his offense? Or was there another compelling reason to trade Doncic now? Was it his possible free agency in the summer of 2026 and the idea of losing him without getting much in return?\n\nThe Mavericks certainly got a star in return. Davis, who is out for about another week with an abdominal strain, is one of the game’s best two-way big men who can score, rebound, block shots, protect the paint and defend on the perimeter.\n\nDoes this move elevate the 26-23 Mavs from eighth place in the Western Conference to title contender? It certainly makes them better defensively and gives them a premier low-post scoring option, and Christie developed into a starter with an improving 3-point game.\n\nLakers trade grade: A-\n\nThe Lakers traded LeBron James’ close friend without James knowing until news of the deal broke. James is no stranger to the business of basketball so whatever sting he feels will disappear with time.\n\nDoncic’s physical conditioning will be scrutinized even more, as will Doncic’s commitment to defense. The Lakers are No. 21 defensively and just got worse with Davis’ departure.\n\nDoncic, who has been out since Christmas with a calf injury and is expected to return this month, gives the Lakers help at the guard position they’ve sought. His offensive skillset is phenomenal, and James and Doncic will create offensive fireworks.\n\nWill that offensive production be enough to compensate for defensive shortcomings, especially in the playoffs? The Lakers are 28-19 and in fifth place in the West, just a half-game behind the Denver Nuggets. They are a hot streak away from challenging Houston and Memphis for second and third place.\n\nCertainly, this was a move made for the present but also the future. The chance to acquire a player of Doncic’s caliber doesn’t come along often. James won’t be around forever. The Lakers are now expecting to have one of the league’s best players for the next decade.\n\nJazz trade grade: B\n\nThe Jazz were mostly innocent bystanders, taking a player and draft picks to help facilitate the surprising portion of the trade. Getting two second-round picks could help facilitate another deal at the trade deadline or in the offseason for the Jazz.\n\n(This story was updated to add a new video)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/02/08/suns-acquiring-kevin-durant-blockbuster-trade-nets/11218042002/", "title": "Kevin Durant traded to Phoenix Suns in blockbuster trade with Nets", "text": "New Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia wasted no time shaking up the franchise.\n\nThe Suns are acquiring NBA superstar Kevin Durant in a blockbuster trade with the Brooklyn Nets, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official.\n\nThe deal will send Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder and four first-round picks to the Nets, in addition to a pick swap in 2028. The Suns will be getting Durant – a 13-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP – and forward T.J. Warren.\n\nThe Durant trade comes in the wake of the Nets trading Kyrie Irving, who signed along with Durant, 34, in Brooklyn in 2019. Moving Durant marks a hard reset for Brooklyn, which is now set to receive Phoenix's first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029.\n\nNBA TRADE DEADLINE TRACKER:Former MVP Kevin Durant moved to Suns in blockbuster\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nDurant requested a trade before the season, but Nets general manager Sean Marks was unable to find a deal that yielded the draft picks Brooklyn sought – especially after Utah received four future first-round picks and 2022 first-round pick Walker Kessler from Minnesota in the Rudy Gobert trade in July.\n\nOnce the Nets dealt Irving to Dallas after his trade request late last week, the Nets re-evaluated the direction they wanted to take and decided to reset and trade Durant.\n\nDurant sustained an isolated MCL sprain of the right knee against Miami on Jan. 8 and has not played since. He was hoping to return for the All-Star Game but that will not happen.

The three players are gone, and Brooklyn fired Nash earlier this season.

The person was not authorized to publicly comment on the deal because it will not be official until after June 30.\n\nIn exchange, the Lakers are sending Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram and three first-round picks — including the No. 4 selection in next week's draft — to the Pelicans.\n\nESPN first reported the details of the trade Saturday.\n\nThe deal will move Davis, one of the league's most dominant players, to Los Angeles — where he will join one of the league's most iconic franchises and play alongside LeBron James, who signed with the Lakers as a free agent last summer.\n\nAll things Lakers: Latest Los Angeles Lakers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nIt also accelerates New Orleans' rebuild under new executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin, who was hired in April. In Ball, Hart and Ingram, the Pelicans will add three former first-round draft picks who are 24 or younger. They also have the No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft and have met with Zion Williamson at least twice since winning the draft lottery.\n\nThe future picks the Pelicans will receive include: a 2021 first-round pick that will go to New Orleans if it lands in the top eight and will become unprotected in 2022 if it doesn't convey; an unprotected 2024 first-round pick, with the right to defer to 2025. New Orleans also gets the right toswap first-round picks in 2023.\n\nDavis, 26, had been on the market for months after he publicly requested a trade out of New Orleans in January, midway through his seventh season there. The request resulted in a $50,000 fine from the NBA, which forbids public trade requests.\n\nSpeculation about Davis' next stop quickly centered around James and the Lakers — in part because James and Davis share the same agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group.\n\nMagic Johnson, the former president of the Lakers, said the team explored the possibility of acquiring Davis before the trade deadline in February but he believed the Pelicans did not negotiate in good faith. The Pelicans fired general manager Dell Demps shortly thereafter, and Johnson abruptly resigned his position two months later.\n\nAt least one of those two former executives was celebrating the deal Saturday.\n\n\"Great job by Owner Jeanie Buss bringing Anthony Davis to the Lakers!\" Johnson wrote on Twitter. \"Laker Nation, the Lakers are back in a championship hunt! Congratulations to the entire organization. I know LeBron James has a big smile on his face. I’m loving this!!\"\n\nIn Davis, the Lakers will add a six-time All-Star and formidable defensive presence who is averaging 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game thus far in his career.

Porzingis also has the option of accepting a qualifying offer and playing for Dallas in 2019-20 and becoming an unrestricted free agent following that season.\n\nPorzingis’ time with the Knicks never amounted to what could’ve been.

A split may be the best direction for both parties.\n\nIn a meeting with Knicks president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry Thursday morning, Porzingis told them he wasn't on board with the Knicks' plan and wanted out.\n\nMills and Perry acknowledged they had sensed Porzingis' frustration and had been talking to multiple teams throughout this season. If it seems things moved quickly from a morning meeting to an afternoon trade, Perry said they had about eight or nine options from which to choose and decided to engage with the Mavericks.\n\nFor the Knicks, the unexpected move has wide-ranging possibilities, most notably a significant amount of salary cap space that will allow the Knicks to offer max contracts to two big-name free agents in July.\n\nNew York could have as much as $76.4 million in salary cap space in free agency this summer, according to ESPN.

He can become a free agent in the summer of 2026, and his most lucrative financial option is signing a three-year, $165.3 million extension this summer then getting a new deal starting in 2028-29 that is for five years and worth nearly $420 million.\n\nLuka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade grades:Who won deal between Lakers and Mavericks?\n\nWere the Mavericks concerned about Luka Doncic’s physical conditioning and defense?\n\nDoncic hasn't made an All-Defense team and his physical conditioning has been questioned.\n\nHowever, he is a five-time All-NBA selection who finished third in MVP voting in 2023-24. Teams generally don’t get rid of that kind of talent.\n\nDoncic helped lead the Mavericks back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011, when Dallas won its first NBA title.\n\nDoncic led several statistical categories during the 2024 playoffs including points (635), rebounds (208), assists (178) and steals (41) despite losing to the Boston Celtics in a five-game NBA Finals series.\n\nDoncic is a triple-double threat every game and averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists and shot 46.4% from the field and 35.4% on 3-pointers this season before he was sidelined with a calf injury on Christmas.\n\nThis season, the Mavericks were nearly 10 points per 100 possessions better than their opponent with Doncic on the court compared to when he wasn’t playing.\n\nDid Mark Cuban play a role in Dallas Mavericks trading Luka?\n\nMark Cuban, who bought the Mavericks in 2000, sold his majority share to the families of Miriam Adelson and Sivan and Patrick Dumont in December of 2023.

In his three seasons with the 76ers, Chamberlain won three MVP awards.\n\nHe was traded again in 1968 to the Los Angeles Lakers in another blockbuster and won a second NBA title there.\n\nOscar Robertson to the Bucks (1970)\n\nThe man who practically invented the triple-double (even before it was ever a thing) was an NBA All-Star each of his first 10 seasons with the Cincinnati Royals.\n\nBut in 1970, at the age of 31, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Charlie Paulk and Flynn Robinson.\n\nIn his first year there, Robertson led a group of young Bucks to the league's best record and a sweep of the Baltimore Bullets in the 1971 NBA Finals.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers (1975)\n\nAlso on that 1970-71 championship Bucks team was a second-year center (Lew Alcindor) who would shortly thereafter change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and was just beginning his dominance in the NBA.\n\nThough the Bucks won their division all four years Kareem and \"The Big O\" were on the same team, they never made it back to the Finals. So in 1975, Milwaukee sent Abdul-Jabbar and Walt Wesley to the 30-52 Los Angeles Lakers for Junior Bridgeman, Dave Meyers, Elmore Smith and Brian Winters.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar was named NBA MVP each of his first two seasons in L.A. as the Lakers began to turn things around. After going 40-42 in his first year, the Lakers never missed the playoffs again in Kareem's final 13 seasons, winning five NBA titles.\n\nCharles Barkley to the Suns (1992)\n\nCharles Barkley was a six-time All-Star with six top-six MVP finishes with the Philadelphia 76ers when he was dealt to the Phoenix Suns in 1992 for Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang and Tim Perry.\n\nAfter going on to star for the USA's gold medal-winning \"Dream Team\" at the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Barkley made his presence felt in Phoenix by leading the Suns to the NBA's best record and earning league MVP honors.\n\nHowever, Barkley lost to fellow Dream Teamer Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the Finals. Although he was an All-Star in each of his four seasons in Phoenix, Barkley never did win that elusive ring.\n\nShaquille O'Neal to the Heat (2004)\n\nShaquille O'Neal was the NBA's most dominant big man at the turn of the 21st Century, winning three consecutive NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers (and being named Finals MVP all three times).\n\nBut after the Lakers lost in the 2004 Finals to the Detroit Pistons, both O'Neal and coach Phil Jackson departed that offseason. The Lakers traded Shaq to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Lamar Odom, a 2006 first-round draft pick and a 2007 second-round draft pick.\n\nIn his first season with Miami, the Heat fell – again to the Pistons – in the Eastern Conference finals, but avenged that loss the following year by advancing to the 2006 NBA Finals and beating the Dallas Mavericks for the title.\n\nCarmelo Anthony to the Knicks (2011)\n\nA native of Brooklyn, Carmelo Anthony returned home after spending his first seven seasons with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAs part of a three-team midseason trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony joined the New York Knicks, along with with Renaldo Balkman, Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and a 2016 first-round draft pick.\n\nAnthony went on to have six consecutive All-Star seasons with the Knicks, leading the NBA in scoring in 2012-13 and finishing third in the MVP balloting. Although most of the other players in the deal had limited impact going forward, one of the draft picks the Nuggets acquired ended up being guard Jamal Murray, who was an important cog in their 2023 championship-winning squad.\n\nPaul George to the Clippers (2019)\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made a bold move toward bolstering their championship hopes by acquiring six-time All-Star forward Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder. It came at a steep cost – Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, three first-round draft picks and another pair of pick swaps.\n\nBut by adding George, the Clippers were also able to sign star free agent Kawhi Leonard, at least somewhat justifying the high price. But with Leonard and George together, the Clippers only made it as far as the conference finals once.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilgeous-Alexander has blossomed into one of the league's top players, with top-five MVP finishes the past two seasons.\n\nAnthony Davis to the Lakers (2019)\n\nShortly before the 2019 NBA draft, the New Orleans Pelicans finally worked out a way to trade disgruntled star Anthony Davis. After the Pelicans won the draft lottery to get the No. 1 overall pick, a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers came together quickly.\n\nNew Orleans received three players – Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart – plus three first-round draft picks (one a first-round swap). Meanwhile, the Lakers went on to win the NBA title in 2020 in Davis' first season.\n\nJames Harden to the Nets (2021)\n\nA huge four-team trade brought three-time scoring champion and 2018 MVP James Harden to Brooklyn midway through the 2020-21 season. The Nets had picked up Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in free agency a year earlier and felt the addition of Harden would give them the \"Big Three\" needed to win a championship.\n\nBut to pull it off, the Nets had to give up Rodions Kurucs and three first-round picks to the Houston Rockets, plus several draft pick swaps. In addition, they dealt Caris LeVert and a pair of second-round picks to the Indiana Pacers and sent Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe trade was an unmitigated disaster that culminated with a second-round playoff exit and Harden being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers midway through the following season.\n\nKevin Durant to the Suns (2023)\n\nAfter the Phoenix Suns lost in the 2021 NBA Finals and then bowed out in the second round the following year despite having the league's best regular-season record, the midseason acquisition of All-Star forward Kevin Durant was believed to be the missing piece to get them over the top.\n\nIn a four-way trade with the Brooklyn Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers, the 34-year-old Durant made his way to Phoenix in a massive exchange of players and draft picks (some of which still have yet to be exercised).\n\nEven with Durant on board, the Suns still lost in the second round of the playoffs that season. And they exited in the first round last year.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\n(This story was updated to add a new video)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/07/11/russell-westbrook-chris-paul-trade-thunder-rockets/1710614001/", "title": "Russell Westbrook traded for Chris Paul in blockbuster deal", "text": "Russell Westbrook and James Harden are teammates again — this time with the Houston Rockets.\n\nAnd now the Rockets have the 2017 MVP (Westbrook) and 2018 MVP (Harden).\n\nOklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti continues to reshape the team's future, sending Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul and two first-round draft picks, a person familiar with the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is announced by the teams.\n\nOklahoma City in the past week has moved fast when it comes to trading All-Stars. First, it was Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, and now it’s Westbrook to the Rockets, where he will join former Thunder teammate Harden.\n\nAfter the Thunder traded George for five first-round round picks, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari, it became apparent Westbrook’s time in Oklahoma City was coming to an end.\n\nThe 11-year veteran and eight-time All-Star did not want to be part of a rebuild.\n\nThis deal re-energizes the Rockets, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs the past two seasons, including the 2018 Western Conference finals.\n\nIn the offseason, the Rockets watched other teams in the West, especially the Utah Jazz, Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers, improve. And before the Westbrook trade, the Rockets hadn’t made any moves that moved the needle.\n\nThis one definitely moves the needle.

Both players are different than they were when the last played together with the Thunder in 2012.\n\nRockets coach Mike D’Antoni, known as an offensive genius, has work in front of him to incorporate two guards who like to have the ball and attempt at least 20 shots per game.\n\nThe Thunder talked with Westbrook after the George trade, and he was amenable to a trade to a playoff team. The Miami Heat, who just acquired Jimmy Butler in free agency, had interest in trading for Westbrook, but was limited by salary cap constraints.\n\nOklahoma City has piled up draft picks and now 10 first-round picks through the 2026 draft. It’s going to be a long rebuild, and the Thunder need to hit on some of those picks. But if the Thunder score on some of them — like they did with Wesbrook, Harden and Kevin Durant — the Thunder are in position to have one of the brightest long-term futures in the NBA.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/11"}]}

Regional watchers warn that the popularity of Bukele’s policy could see copycat measures in the region, with other countries in Latin America already enforcing similar extra-legal measures to tackle their own gang problems.\n\nAnd as Jonathan D. Rosen, an assistant professor at New Jersey City University, who has co-authored several books on organized crime, drug trafficking and security in the Americas, points out, history has shown that mano dura policies have a way of biting back.\n\n‘A perfect recipe for abuse’\n\nEl Salvador is home to some of the world’s most notorious gangs, including Barrio 18 and MS-13. The latter emerged in Los Angeles in the 1980s among Salvadoran immigrants who had fled their homeland amid a violent civil war funded in part by the United States. It grew to include other Central American migrants, and in the 1990s, many were deported to their home countries, causing an explosion of violence there, say experts.\n\nBefore Bukele’s crackdown, an estimated 70,000 active gang members across the country made it “virtually impossible for politicians and state officials to avoid engaging with them if they wish to, among other things, carry out an election campaign or provide services in poor neighborhoods,” according to a report by the Crisis Group.\n\nA police officer questions a young man during a security operation against gang violence in Soyapango, just east of the capital San Salvador, on August 16, 2022. Sthanly Estrada/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut rights groups fear the effort to root them out has taken a toll of its own, resulting in the arrest of 58,000 people between March and November 2022, overstuffed jails, and the militarization of Salvadorean society as forces patrol the streets.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele’s dragnet – torture and ill treatment in detention, and arbitrary arrests as the police and army target low-income neighborhoods, according to a HRW report released on December 7.\n\nMany of the arrests in the past year appear to be based on questionable evidence, such as the person’s appearance, background or anonymous tip-offs “and uncorroborated allegations on social media,” HRW writes.\n\nOn December 3, Bukele’s war on gangs escalated when security forces “completely fenced off” the country’s most populous municipality, Soyapango, as he described in a Twitter post. Bukele also shared a video showing gun-toting troops marching in the area.\n\nJuan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told CNN that the authoritarian measures in Soyapango constituted “a perfect recipe for abuse,” impeding on people’s freedom of movement.\n\n“There’s a trend in Latin America, of believing that in order to address very serious security concerns you need to suspend rights,” Pappier told CNN.\n\nPappier points to the example of Chile, which has had an extended state of emergency in response to violence in the country’s south, which was extended for a month in late November, and Ecuador, where the government announced similar measures in response to gang violence in prisons in November.\n\nEcudaor announced a state of emergency in response to gang violence in prisons. Juan Carlos Perez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, Honduras’ leftist leader Xiomara Castro, who ran for government on a human rights platform, launched a month-long partial state of emergency amid outcry against extortion levels, suspending constitutional rights in certain regions as she cracks down on criminal groups.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Jamaica – which has one of the highest murder rates in the Caribbean (per 100,000 people) – declared a widespread state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows security forces to arrest people and search buildings without warrants.\n\nWhen mano dura backfires\n\nPrevious Salvadoran governments have tried to tackle gangs with similar strategies only to worsen the outcome.\n\nFormer President Antonio Saca – who pleaded guilty in 2018 of embezzling $300 million in public funds – unveiled a plan known as “super mano dura,” where analysts say mass imprisonment led to gangs consolidating their power behind bars.\n\n“The deployment of the military and police to combat gangs resulted in the gangs fighting not only with each other but also with the government. In 2015, El Salvador surpassed Honduras as the most violent country in the world, with a murder rate of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The country has seen more violence in recent years than during the civil war,” according to a 2020 study by Rosen.\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele speaks to around 14,000 soldiers in El Salvador. Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTackling crime remained the top of the agenda in 2019, when Bukele swept into power promising to end corruption and gang violence. The millennial styled himself as an iconoclast with his embrace of bitcoin and fondness of backward baseball caps, but fears quickly mounted about his authoritarian tendencies.\n\nCritical journalists and civil society members were allegedly targeted by his administration, and in 2020, he sent armed troops into Congress as he demanded that lawmakers approve his plan to secure a loan to tackle gang violence. Last September, a constitutional court stacked with his allies, according to non-profit Freedom House, cleared the way for Bukele to run for two consecutive terms.\n\nIn 2022, El Salvador’s government denied responsibility for hacking the cell phones of at least 35 journalists and other members of civil society by using the spying program known as Pegasus.\n\nAs the country’s murder rate began to fall in 2020, reports emerged of Bukele’s government allegedly cutting a deal with gangs.\n\nAccording to a US Treasury Department statement, Bukele’s administration was accused of providing financial incentives to MS -13 and Barrio 18 in 2020 to “ensure that incidents of gang violence and the number of confirmed homicides remained low.”\n\nBukele’s government has denied the allegations, with Bukele describing it on Twitter as an “obvious lie.”\n\nThere is some consensus among security watchers that Bukele’s truce with the gangs fell apart “in late March (2022) which prompted the MS-16 to do the killing spree to pressure the government to give concessions,” said Breda.\n\nThe alleged move backfired, and Bukele announced a state of emergency and the suspension of several constitutional rights.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele's dragnet, according to a Human Rights Watch report. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccurate statistics have been hard to get hold of as authorities kept the data private, according to HRW. But citing a National Civil Police document they obtained, there was a 50% decrease in homicides between January and the end of October compared to the same period the last year, the rights group said in its report.\n\nOther analysts agree. “From what we hear from communities living close to gangs, they confirm that most of the gangs are on their knees, (many) have fled or hiding in rural areas, of course this is affecting more the rank-and-file members rather than the leadership (of the gangs),” Breda said.\n\nA new crisis\n\nRights experts have noted the US’ recent silence on the prolonged crackdown.\n\nAfter initially being tough on Bukele’s attacks on the rule of law, “most recently we have seen ambiguous positions, which seems to be part of the Biden administration obsession in preventing migration,” Pappier said.\n\nAlleged gang members at a maximum security prison in Izalco, El Salvador, on September 4, 2020. Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess crime will compel fewer people to leave the country and seek asylum in the US in the short term, he said. Though Pappier doubts it will last, as many families have lost their sole breadwinner in the crime sweep. “Some of them are scared of police…so the deprivations of rights also have a cost and can also generate its own migration,” he said.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN that “gang violence is a serious problem, and El Salvador and the United States have a vested interest in ensuring that these violent criminals are off the streets. At the same time, we have urged President Nayib Bukele and his administration to address the gang threat in a way that respects and protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of El Salvador.”\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated the US’ belief that the state of emergency “is an unsustainable policy that has raised serious concerns about human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and deaths.”\n\nEl Salvador now has the perfect conditions for recruiting new gang members, Pappier adds. “People with no connection to gangs are getting arrested, are in prisons, and are completely deprived of their livelihoods – that is the perfect kind of person to recruit,” Pappier said.\n\nSo will Bukele listen? “Have you noticed how the mainstream media and NGOs have intensified their attacks in recent days?” El Salvador’s President wrote on Twitter a day after HRW’s report was published.\n\n“It is not that they are interested in El Salvador (they never were), their fear is that we will succeed, because other governments will want to imitate it. They fear the power of example.”", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/06/york-co-woman-am-joining-caravan-welcome-refugees/1906044002/", "title": "Migrant caravan: York County woman says I am joining the caravan", "text": "Carol Stowell\n\nI plan to volunteer at our Southern Border to help welcome and support refugees who are legally coming here to seek asylum.\n\nWhy?

Others are just here unlawfully — many with U.S.-born children, jobs and no criminal backgrounds.\n\nSuch was the case of Albanian immigrant Cile Precetaj, a mother of three American children who immigration lawyers say represents the plight of many like her. The Troy woman with no criminal record got a 24-hour deportation notice, ordering her to report to Metro Airport last Tuesday morning. She defied the order.\n\nAfter her story appeared in the Detroit Free Press, triggering public outcry, immigration authorities decided to re-evaluate her case. On Friday, the government granted her a one-year stay of removal, and she can reapply for more time when the 12 months are up.\n\nShe's one of the lucky ones, experts say.\n\n\"This kind of thing happens almost 200,000 times a year. It's not unique,\" said Greg Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington, D.C. \"The fact is, tens of thousands of people are deported every year ... who are no danger to the community.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a record 409,849 people were deported in 2012. Of those, 45% had no criminal record.\n\n\"That's one of the biggest concerns,\" said Chen, calling the government's immigration enforcement tactics \"the most aggressive and robust\" the country has ever seen. The record deportation numbers — which have doubled over the last decade — are proof, he said. \"And it has had an incredibly damaging impact on separating families.\"\n\nICE has defended its tactics, stating: \"Strategic and deliberative enforcement of our nation's immigration laws is critical to national security and public safety.\" ICE also praised efforts over the past four years, stating the agency \"has seen unprecedented successes in enforcing the nation's immigration laws.\"\n\nAn issue of discretion\n\nThe number of deportations out of the Detroit field office has remained steady over the last five years: about 8,000 immigrants removed every year, according to ICE figures.\n\nAn estimated 11 million people are living in the U.S. illegally, with 100,000 of them in Michigan, according to government statistics.\n\nDeportations aside, the government also is prosecuting a record number of immigrants and sending them to prison for sneaking into the country. Prosecutions of illegal entry and re-entry cases have skyrocketed in the U.S., reaching a record 97,384 in 2013 — a 367% increase from a decade ago and a 1,420% increase from two decades ago.\n\nWhat's especially troubling, lawyers say, is that authorities aren't showing discretion.\n\n\"Here in the Calhoun County Jail, I see anywhere from murderers being deported to people who are like my mother — little old ladies who have never been in contact with the legal system before, and they're terrified,\" said immigration attorney Chris Veerland, who practices near Battle Creek. \"They take moms away, too.\"\n\nA 24-hour notice is common, he said.\n\n\"We call 'em suitcase letters,\" he said, noting plenty of his clients wind up on the weekly flight at Metro Airport.\n\nThey include mothers and fathers of U.S.-born children. \"The simple fact that you have an American-born child doesn't guarantee you a stay in the country ... that's just not the case,\" Veerland said.\n\nDetroit attorney Noel Saleh, who has been practicing immigration law for 36 years, can attest to that. Among his clients is Jose Avila Anguiano, a Mexican immigrant who married an American, had children, owned a home, paid taxes and was active in his church and community. He got deported last year over alleged misrepresentations he made on a document he filed about 20 years ago, Saleh said.\n\n\"It was a crazy case,\" said Saleh, who successfully appealed the deportation and got his client back in the country. \"The removal of people who are in the country doing bad things is understandable ... but the other 45% — there is no rational basis for the use of funds to remove people and separate them from their families.\"\n\nBut the government is closing nearly 8% of cases nationwide — or about 26,700 cases in the 2013 fiscal year — based on prosecutorial discretion, according to the TRAC Immigration Project at Syracuse University.\n\nThat's still not enough, say immigration lawyers, arguing judges and immigration authorities were far more forgiving 10 to 20 years ago.\n\n\"There's much less room for people to make a mistake,\" Saleh said. \"People used to be given a second chance, and that's not what's happening under the current (immigration law).\"\n\nIn Washington, several immigration reform bills have been introduced over the years. Currently, a Senate bill is pending that would provide illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship and require more spending for Border Patrol. The House has yet to vote on the bill, which has to be approved by the end of 2014.\n\nPresident Barack Obama also enforced a policy in 2012 that provides young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children temporary protection from deportation and the opportunity to apply for jobs. The policy, called Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA), applies to immigrants ages 15 to 30.\n\nA terrifying text\n\nPjetro \"Pete\" Gojcevic, a cook in Detroit, had just taken an order for an omelet when he got a mind-numbing text message from his wife on Monday. She texted him a photo of a deportation notice she had just received, telling her to report to Detroit Metro Airport the next morning for removal.\n\nStartled, he made scrambled eggs instead of the omelet.\n\n\"It was horrible. I didn't know what to think or what we were going to do,\" recalled Gojcevic. \"They just told her, 'We have your travel documents ... be at the airport.'\"\n\nHis 41-year-old wife stayed home instead. Immigration officers never came looking for her. By week's end, she got a letter from ICE stating that her request for a stay had been granted, and she had at least another year in the country.\n\n\"I am very happy. This is good news,\" Precetaj said while eating dinner with her 4-year-old daughter in a Detroit restaurant Friday night. \"All I want is to stay here and raise my kids and have a normal life.\"\n\nWith enough public support, that's possible, said Ola Kaso, a 21-year-old University of Michigan premed student who was spared from deportation three years ago.\n\nLike Precetaj, Kaso's case garnered headlines and public support. The former high school class valedictorian and her mother were facing deportation to Albania. According to court records, Kaso's family legally came to the U.S. in 1998 but lost their bid for asylum, in part, because an attorney did not file the proper court papers.\n\nWith public support, Kaso was granted a one-year stay of removal.

Khatibzadeh said it may affect Iran’s relationship with the agency and the nuclear talks.\n\nThe draft resolution calls on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA’s probe into uranium particles found at three undeclared sites in Iran.\n\nThe Biden administration restarted talks with Iran last year to re-enter the 2015 nuclear agreement, which President Donald Trump withdrew from. Last month, US Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley said the prospects of a return to the Iran nuclear deal were “tenuous at best.”\n\n“If Iran maintains demands that go beyond the scope of the JCPOA, we will continue to reject them, and there will be no deal. It is not our preference, but we are fully prepared to live with and confront that reality if that is Iran’s choice,” he continued.\n\nGrossi said Monday that the IAEA was ready to re-engage Iran to “resolve these matters.”\n\n“As in the past, and in order for the Agency to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, the Agency remains ready to re-engage without delay with Iran to resolve these matters,” he said.", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Jeremy Herb", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/middleeast/iran-nuclear-weapon-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Iran nuclear: Tehran is closer than ever to a nuclear weapon as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLong-running tensions over Iran’s nuclear capabilities may have reached a point of no return this week, thrusting the Middle East into uncharted waters.\n\nTehran has ramped up uranium enrichment at a pace not seen since the 2015 signing of a landmark deal, which saw Iran curb uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief, before former United States President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018.\n\nAnalysts believe that Tehran may have already attained the material needed to manufacture a nuclear weapon.\n\nOn Thursday, Iran switched off surveillance cameras used by the international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, to monitor activity at the country’s key nuclear facilities. The move, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned, could deal a “fatal blow” to negotiations that seek to revive the nuclear deal.\n\nThe absence of footage from nuclear sites deprives the negotiators of the nuclear deal – known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – of data, making it “technically impossible to have an agreement,” IAEA chief Raphael Grossi told CNN Thursday.\n\n“Or you could have (a deal) on the basis of no information, which I suppose is not going to happen,” said Grossi. “This is why we are saying it’s a very serious thing. It has consequences. Of course it does.”\n\nIran has also begun installing advanced centrifuges in a cluster at an underground enrichment plant, according to Reuters, which reported that it saw an IAEA report describing the escalated nuclear activity in Iran. The reported incident came after the governing body of the IAEA passed a resolution for failing to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites.\n\nThe acceleration of Iran’s nuclear program comes amid rising tensions between Iran and the US. Talks around the JCPOA are at a standstill over mounting pressure from Tehran to have the country’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – the elite branch of the Iranian Armed Forces – delisted as a terror organization. This is believed to be the final sticking point in nearly a year and a half of negotiations between the two countries.\n\nBoth sides have so far refused to budge on the issue, thanks to domestic political pressure in their respective countries.\n\nTrump listed the IRGC as a foreign terror organization during his final weeks in office. The decision was called a “poison pill” by his critics, who accused Trump of throwing a wrench in the wheels of future negotiations over the restoration of the JCPOA.\n\nDangerous days ahead\n\nThe stalled negotiations have dangerous implications for the region.\n\n“While both the US and Iran have dealt with most of the technicalities of returning to the nuclear deal, differences remain on areas that are largely symbolic,” said Dina Esfandiary, senior adviser for the Middle East and North Africa at Crisis Group.\n\n“As a result, Iran is now lashing out by increasing the pressure,” she added.\n\nWhen Trump pulled out of the JCPOA in 2018, he unleashed a wave of crushing sanctions on Iran’s economy. The US government found, at the time, that Tehran continued to comply with the deal. But as with many Obama-era policies, Trump was intent on undoing the landmark nuclear agreement, citing Iran’s continued meddling in the Middle East through Tehran-aligned paramilitary groups.\n\nAn ardent opponent of Trump’s so-called “maximum pressure campaign” against Iran, US President Joe Biden revived the negotiations when he took office. But Biden’s policy has so far failed to resurrect the deal, and Iran has steadily upped the ante in violating its end of the agreement.\n\n“The Iranians have seen no benefits from the JCPOA since 2018,” said Executive Vice President at the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi. “The IAEA has seen benefits for it. Others have seen benefits for it because the Iranians by and large have been in compliance.”\n\n“It was only a question of time before this would come to an end, in which the Iranians would say ‘well if we’re not getting anything for it, why should you?’” Parsi added.\n\nIran remains roughly a year away from manufacturing a nuclear weapon, according to analysts, who say that the region could now move inexorably towards further escalation.\n\nIn 2019, satellite imagery showed the construction of an experimental nuclear reactor making “expedition” progress in Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates also has a nuclear program. Both of those countries’ nuclear activities appear to be happening with the safeguards of the IAEA. Yet the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran may prompt an already tenuous security situation to spiral, raising the specter of a nuclear arms race in the volatile region.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has run out of options, given that the US has already sanctioned Iran under the Trump administration.\n\nThe sanctions have dealt a heavy blow to its economy but have not destroyed it, and Iran is likely to be desensitized to further economic penalties. Israel’s assassinations in recent years of top officials – including a pre-eminent nuclear scientist – have also failed to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment.\n\nThis may lead the US and its allies to consider pursuing a military option.\n\nA war on Iran may crush its nuclear program, but would wreak unspeakable havoc on the region as a whole, in addition to dragging the US into a region it has tried to disengage from.\n\n“Some of the most aggressive escalation from the Iranian side in terms of ramping up the program happened under Biden’s watch, not Trump’s watch,” said Parsi. “That’s because Biden continued Trump’s policy.”", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/21/americas/colombia-marijuana-bill-war-on-drugs-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Colombia marijuana: This country calls time on the 'war on drugs ...", "text": "Bogotà, Colombia CNN —\n\nIt’s the home of notorious drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, and the origin of legendary Santa Marta Gold – once the most sought-after varieties of weed in the United States – named after Colombia’s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range.\n\nFor many, Colombia is synonymous with drug cartels and narco-traffickers. It is one of the largest narcotics producers in the world – last year, the US government estimated was producing over one million kilograms of cocaine, the highest in the world and more than the two closest nations, Peru and Bolivia, combined. So when the South American country’s new president says he intends to regulate the use of illegal substances – or at least some of them – the world listens.\n\n“It is time to accept that the war on drugs has been a complete failure,” Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced during his inauguration festivities earlier this month, commenting on a bill his administration recently presented to legalize recreational marijuana to Congress.\n\nColombia’s law already allows the production of cannabis for medical purposes, mostly to be exported to foreign markets like the United States and Canada, but supporters of the new legislation believe that only legalizing recreational cannabis can push thousands of farmers away from drug trafficking and into the legal trade.\n\nTo this day, the Colombian state faces challenges over control of its territory by a variety of criminal actors, from former left-wing guerrillas and paramilitaries to narco-cartels and organized crime syndicates. Drug trafficking is a powerful source of revenue for these outlaws, and over the past 50 years public authorities have pushed a prohibitionist agenda, banning the trade and consumption of drugs in order to hit the criminals in their pockets. But the stream of illegal drugs never ceased.\n\n“We will never achieve peace in Colombia until we regulate drug trafficking,” said Senator Gustavo Bolivar, one of the signatories of the new bill and a close ally of the new president.\n\n“Not even the United States, with all their might and money, could win the war on drugs… Right now, Colombia produces more drugs than when Pablo Escobar was alive, there are more consumers, more farmers. The drug trade is growing despite the money we invest in fighting it, and the thousands of deaths we suffer,” said Bolivar, who recently traveled to Colorado for a firsthand look at the economic benefits of legalizing weed.\n\nIn an interview, Bolivar told CNN it was hypocritical of the United States to legalize marijuana at home, and supporting drug wars abroad such as in Colombia, where Washington sends millions of dollars every year to arm and train Colombian forces in their struggle against the cartels.\n\nA landmark report from the Truth Commission, an interdisciplinary panel tasked to investigate over 50 years of civil conflict in Colombia, found that drug trafficking helped prolong the conflict despite almost $8 billion in military aid from the US to Colombia. At least 260,000 Colombians, the vast majority civilians, were killed in the violence.\n\nColombia's President Gustavo Petro delivers a speech after his inauguration ceremony at Bolivar Square in Bogota, on August 7, 2022. Juan Barreto/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA new generation of Colombian leaders\n\nThe campaign to legalize weed in Colombia unites left-wing senators like Bolivar with civil society organizations and deep-pocketed foreign investors, and has received a boost over the last 12 months from the country’s changing politics, with Petro ascending to the presidency and progressive parties now a majority in Colombian congress.\n\n“We saw the legalization of adult-use recreational two, three, or four years down the line… but now we’re hoping for this year,” said Luis Merchan, a Colombian businessman who is the CEO of Flora Growth, a Toronto-based company that is investing in Colombian marijuana from medical cannabis to textile hemp.\n\nThe campaigners who have demanded this shift for years agree.\n\n“We think now the time is ripe to do it,” says Luis Felipe Ruiz, an investigator at Colombia’s NGO Dejusticia, which supports decriminalizing drugs and has documented the war on drugs for years. Drug trafficking is the top cause of detention in Colombia and, according to the Colombian Justice Ministry, 13% of the country’s detainees are serving a sentence related to the drug trade. Ruiz argues that one of the benefits of legalizing marijuana would also be decreasing the prison population in the country.\n\nPeople take part in a rally to commemorate World Cannabis Day in Bogota in April 2022. Raul Arboleda/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“There’s a large part of the political world that is ready to have a debate on legalizing marijuana and, frankly, taking away the stigma against cannabis is already a great victory for us,” Ruiz told CNN.\n\nThose who oppose legalization hail from the conservative right and believe the shift would just make drug abuse easier. Former President Alvaro Uribe, a political mentor of Petro’s predecessor Ivan Duque and the main exponent of conservativism in the country, tweeted in 2020 that “recreational marijuana leads to other drugs, alters the neurons, the consumer reaches states of alienation, loses control over his decisions, which is the loss of his freedom,” celebrating when a previous project to legalize weed was blocked in Congress.\n\nIllegal agriculture\n\nHistorically, marijuana in Colombia is grown by small-scale farmers who cannot afford the pharmaceutical licenses required to produce medical cannabis, so they sell their product to drug cartels.\n\nThe bill presented to Congress could allow these small-scale farmers, most of them based in chronically underdeveloped rural regions of Colombia, to finally enter the legal market.\n\nCOCCAM, a confederation of coca, marijuana and poppy growers that works as a lobbying group for illicit farmers, estimates that up to 3,000 families depend on illegal marijuana as a main source of their income, mostly in the southwestern department of Cauca. In most cases, these farmers live in isolated rural areas that are hours away from the closest paved road.\n\nPolice officers walk among packages of seized cocaine at the Pacific port of Buenaventura, Colombia. Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nCompared to legal agricultural products like fruit and vegetables, marijuana and coca leaves don’t spoil for days and sell at a higher price per kilogram. They also have the advantage of growing all-year round, while most plants give a harvest only a few months a year.\n\nBecause of Colombia’s historic role, legalizing recreational use would be an immense cultural shift – and perhaps a source of pride, Marchan said.\n\n“It would be not only a source of pride for someone like me for what was frowned upon: I have been in business for a number of decades and when somebody learns that I’m from Colombia you always get the ‘ahh,’ that weird look,” he said.\n\nLegal cocaine?\n\nThe Colombian constitution explicitly forbids using narcotic drugs without medical prescription. Juancho Torres/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nBolivar, the senator, believes the Colombian regulatory system will, eventually, follow the same path by legalizing not only marijuana but even cocaine – the most lucrative source of income for the cartels.\n\nDrafting numbers on an illegal market is never an exact science, but a 2016 study from the Colombian government estimated that drug trafficking – the flow of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, that is produced in Colombia and sold in international markets from Europe, to North America, to Asia – was worth up to 3.8% of the Colombian GDP or $7.5 million at the time.\n\nIn comparison, illegal drug consumption – intended as the drugs that are consumed illegally in Colombia and where marijuana plays a larger role – was worth 0.75% of the Colombian GDP – $2.18 million.\n\n“Marijuana is small change in the drug business. The big money that the cartels are making, and the lion’s share of the problem, is called cocaine. And people in Colombia and Mexico will continue to die as long as we look at the problem with hypocrisy,” Bolivar told CNN.\n\nHe envisions a network of state-regulated dispensaries where cocaine could be sold under medical prescription, and regional agreements across other drug producing countries. The three largest producers of cocaine in the world – Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru – are all currently ruled by ideologically aligned, left-wing leaders. Bolivia has a thriving legal market of coca byproducts, mostly dry leaves that are chewed by the indigenous population and already in 2012, the governments of Bolivia and Colombia pushed for a regional re-thinking of drug policies in multilateral meetings.\n\n“We could for example make a small treaty in our countries to modify the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs and plant the first flag of legalization in the world; other countries may follow,” the senator said.\n\nBut before international treaties are rewritten, Colombia might still have a legal battle ahead of it. As it stands, the Colombian constitution explicitly forbids using narcotic drugs without medical prescription; so even if Congress passed a law legalizing recreational marijuana, it could be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n\nAn appeal to eliminate that article has already started by another lawmaker, Congressman Juan Carlos Losada.\n\n“It’s a two-front battle. Our legalizing bill in Congress, and the appeal by Losada to the constitutional court.

We’re outmanned. We’re out-staffed. We do need responsible gun legislation,” Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams, who is president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a group that represents police chiefs in large cities around the country, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. “We do believe that there should be a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in order for us to properly serve and protect our community.”\n\nLate last month, two key groups – the International Association of Chiefs of Police and Fraternal Order of Police – issued a joint letter pushing for legislative action. The groups reiterated their support on Sunday for gun control legislation when they praised an agreement between senators on a framework for a gun bill.\n\nJim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said he spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat and one of the lead negotiators on a Senate gun bill, Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, officials at the White House, the Department of Justice and interest groups on both sides of the gun reform debate.\n\nAn FOP endorsement is meaningful for both parties at a time when crime has become a central election issue for voters, and the group supported Donald Trump in 2020. Pasco told CNN withholding an endorsement is not out of the question.\n\nDuring a press call, Pasco pushed for compromise.\n\n“Progress can sometimes be getting some of what you want, and failure is always getting none of what you want,” he said. “We need to be willing to take those first incremental steps.”\n\nPasco told CNN that FOP is committed to the “art of the doable” and was reluctant to define legislative text preemptively.\n\nRetired Chief Terry Cunningham, deputy executive director of the IACP, told CNN while he is a “fervent” supporter of the Second Amendment, he believes that right is limited.\n\nHe pointed to strong licensing laws and extreme risk protective orders as effective measures, while admitting a final bill may not encompass all that IACP wishes.\n\n“We’re also realists,” he said. “Although we may want to go further, it’s clear that Congress probably isn’t going to.”\n\nWhile approaches may differ, a recent press call arranged by 21 CP Solutions, a public safety consulting firm, made clear that five groups – ranging from a police lobbying group to professional organizations for chiefs, women and black law enforcement leaders – believe the time for gun-related legislation is now.\n\n“I have seen the devastating consequences of unchecked gun violence can have on the communities we serve – gun violence that could have been curbed by meaningful action by Congress,” East Baton Rouge County Sheriff’s Office Captain Frederick Thomas said on the call. “I cannot ignore the fact that federal inaction has led us to this horrific infection.”\n\nThe head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Police Chief Dwight Henninger of Vail, Colorado, framed the gun epidemic in America as an international embarrassment.\n\n“I’m asked by police leaders around the world, ‘What’s going on in the United States, and why can’t you fix the problem?’” Henninger said.\n\n“As a victim of gun violence, when I was shot at, and my partner was killed on duty, I have an understanding of what the victims are feeling, and the continued ‘thoughts and prayers’ comments are not enough,” he said.\n\nThe unity of the five groups also highlights a chasm in the wider law enforcement community over how to balance Second Amendment rights with a gun crime. Law enforcement groups submitted opposing briefs in the most consequential Second Amendment case taken up by the Supreme Court in decades: New York State Rifle and Pistol Association V. Bruen. The court is set to rule in coming weeks on the case, which challenges the legality of New York’s requirement to show a valid reason when applying for a concealed carry permit.\n\nIn July 2021, several police organizations joined several other firearms associations to support gun rights advocates, arguing the outbreak of “murders and shootings” since the 2020 death of George Floyd heightened the need for “self-defense where it is most frequently needed: outside the home.”\n\nAbout two months later, a group of former large city police chiefs, such as former New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and former Philadelphia Police Commissioner and CNN contributor Charles Ramsey, urged the court to keep New York’s 108-year-old law in place, arguing that “may-issue” gun permitting laws that give states discretion on how they approve gun permits were “a critical component of their obligation to safeguard … their citizens.”", "authors": ["Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/politics/biden-zelensky-call/index.html", "title": "Ukrainian official tells CNN Biden's call with Ukrainian President 'did ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA call between US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday “did not go well,” a senior Ukrainian official told CNN, amid disagreements over the “risk levels” of a Russian attack.\n\nThe White House, however, disputed the official’s account, warning that anonymous sources were “leaking falsehoods.” They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a “distinct possibility.”\n\nOn the call, which the Ukrainian official described as “long and frank,” Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now virtually certain, once the ground had frozen later in February, according to the official.\n\nZelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains “dangerous but ambiguous,” and it is not certain that an attack will take place, the official said.\n\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne disputed the senior Ukrainian official’s description of the call. “Anonymous sources are ‘leaking’ falsehoods,” she told CNN. “President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false.”\n\nThe frank discussion between the two leaders comes as the US and NATO continue to brace for the prospect of a Russian invasion. Though they have stressed the need for diplomacy, the White House has warned an invasion could be imminent with tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border.\n\nThe call lasted an hour and 20 minutes Thursday, according to a US national security official, highlighting the extensive issues the two leaders had to discuss amid the Russian troop buildup. The official described the call as “long and serious,” but “productive,” as Biden and Zelensky discussed Russia’s recent aggressions.\n\nBiden told Zelensky that US officials have assessed an invasion could potentially happen in February, but did not say it definitely would, the official said.\n\nWhite House says Biden promised US would ‘respond decisively’ if Russia invades\n\nA White House readout of the call said that Biden “reaffirmed” to Zelensky that the United States would “respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.” Biden also said the US will explore “additional macroeconomic support” to help the Ukrainian economy as a result of Russia’s military buildup.\n\n“President Biden noted the United States has provided Ukraine with over half a billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the last year, and is exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia’s military build-up,” the White House said in the readout.\n\nA spokesman for Zelensky also disputed the Ukrainian official’s characterization of the call. Zelensky tweeted that he and Biden had a long call where they “discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future.” The Ukrainian President said he thanked Biden for the ongoing military assistance and said “possibilities for financial support to Ukraine were also discussed.”\n\nThe senior Ukrainian official, however, told CNN that Biden said Ukraine would not be offered significantly more military help.\n\nZelensky urged his American counterpart to “calm down the messaging,” warning of the economic impact of panic, according to the official. He also said Ukrainian intelligence sees the threat differently.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader pointed to a recent breakthrough in negotiations with Russia in Paris, saying that he hoped a ceasefire agreement with rebels in eastern Ukraine would be maintained. He also said the talks between the US, Russia and NATO still had some distance to run before diplomatic efforts had been exhausted, the official said.\n\nEarlier in the day, another source from the US side said there is a recognition in the White House that Zelensky has “multiple audiences” and is trying to balance them. “On the one hand, he wants assistance, but he has to assure his people he has the situation under control. That’s a tricky balance,” the source said.\n\nPentagon says Russian buildup is continuing\n\nRussia’s military buildup along the Ukrainian border has increased over the past 24 hours, the Pentagon said Thursday, while the US awaits Russian President Vladimir Putin’s response to its written proposals submitted to Moscow on Wednesday.\n\n“We continue to see, including in the last 24 hours, more accumulation of credible combat forces arrayed by the Russians in, again, the western part of their country and in Belarus,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a press briefing.\n\nKirby described the buildup as “not dramatic” but “also not sclerotic.”\n\nThe US is still holding out hope that diplomatic efforts with Russia can lead to a de-escalation. On Wednesday, the US and NATO submitted separate written responses to Russia’s publicly aired concerns, an overture that Moscow had requested. While the US did not disclose what was contained in the document, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday it did not give any ground NATO’s “open-door policy,” leaving the US at odds with Russia’s central demand that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine.\n\nPutin has read the responses from the US and NATO, a Kremlin spokesman said Thursday, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said they failed to address Russia’s primary concerns.\n\n“There is no positive reaction on the main issue in this document,” Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “The main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation.”\n\nBlinken said Thursday he had “heard a variety of initial responses from different people in Russia to the paper that we shared with them, as well as to the paper that NATO shared with them.”\n\n“But the response that counts is President Putin’s response, and to the best of our understanding, according the Russians, these papers are on his desk,” he said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\n“And we’ll look forward to his response, which I’m sure will be conveyed through Foreign Minister Lavrov and others in the days ahead. That’s what matters most,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday evening, US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield called for a UN Security Council meeting on the crisis to take place on Monday.\n\nUS officials have continued to emphasize they were prepared to act regardless of whether Russia pursues diplomacy or further aggression toward Ukraine, and on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “nothing is off the table” when it comes to sanctions should Moscow invade – including killing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and removing Russia from SWIFT international payment system.\n\n“The commission is responsible for designing, shaping and developing the sanctions,” von der Leyen told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “We are very clear that if there is any further aggression or military aggression of Russia against Ukraine, there will be massive consequences, and severe costs for Russia.”\n\nPentagon details troops on heightened alert\n\nEarlier this week, as many as 8,500 US troops were placed on heightened alert to prepare to deploy to Eastern Europe. Those troops include elements of the 82nd airborne division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as well as elements of the 18th Airborne Corps, the 101st Airborne Division and the Fourth Infantry Division, Kirby said Thursday.\n\nThese units include “medical support, aviation support, logistical support” and “combat formation,” the Pentagon spokesman said.\n\nInside Europe, Kirby said top general of US European Command, Gen. Tod Wolters, was “taking prudent steps” to make sure that US troops based in Europe could be moved within the continent if needed.\n\nThe Pentagon was “not ruling out” the possibility that forces in Europe could be moved to “help bolster capabilities of NATO allies,” Kirby said.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that the US and a handful of allies are in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow’s ongoing aggression, according to three US officials familiar with the discussions.\n\nAmong the countries considering accepting the deployments are Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The deployments would number approximately 1,000 personnel to each country and would be similar to the forward battle groups currently stationed in the Baltic States and Poland.\n\n“We take our NATO commitment seriously.

It would serve as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that President Donald Trump signed Jan. 25. Such memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders.\n\nAlso dated Jan. 25, the draft memo says participating troops would be authorized \"to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.\" It describes how the troops would be activated under a revived state-federal partnership program, and states that personnel would be authorized to conduct searches and identify and arrest any unauthorized immigrants.\n\nRequests to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment and a status report on the proposal were not answered.\n\nThe draft document has circulated among DHS staff over the last two weeks. As recently as Friday, staffers in several different offices reported discussions were underway.\n\nIf implemented, the impact could be significant. Nearly one-half of the 11.1 million people residing in the U.S. without authorization live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 Census data.\n\nUse of National Guard troops would greatly increase the number of immigrants targeted in one of Trump's executive orders last month, which expanded the definition of who could be considered a criminal and therefore a potential target for deportation. That order also allows immigration agents to prioritize removing anyone who has \"committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\"\n\nUnder current rules, even if the proposal is implemented, there would not be immediate mass deportations. Those with existing deportation orders could be sent back to their countries of origin without additional court proceedings. But deportation orders generally would be needed for most other unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe troops would not be nationalized, remaining under state control.\n\nSpokespeople for the governors of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico said they were unaware of the proposal, and either declined to comment or said it was premature to discuss whether they would participate. The other three states did not immediately respond to the AP.\n\nThe proposal would extend the federal-local partnership program that President Barack Obama's administration began scaling back in 2012 to address complaints that it promoted racial profiling.\n\nThe 287(g) program, which Trump included in his immigration executive order, gives local police, sheriff's deputies and state troopers the authority to assist in the detection of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally as a regular part of their law enforcement duties on the streets and in jails.\n\nThe draft memo also mentions other items included in Trump's executive order, including the hiring of an additional 5,000 border agents, which needs financing from Congress, and his campaign promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe signed order contained no mention of the possible use of state National Guard troops.\n\nAccording to the draft memo, the militarization effort would be proactive, specifically empowering Guard troops to solely carry out immigration enforcement, not as an add-on the way local law enforcement is used in the program.\n\nAllowing Guard troops to operate inside non-border states also would go far beyond past deployments.\n\nIn addition to responding to natural or man-made disasters or for military protection of the population or critical infrastructure, state Guard forces have been used to assist with immigration-related tasks on the U.S.-Mexico border, including the construction of fences.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, President George W. Bush twice deployed Guard troops on the border to focus on non-law enforcement duties to help augment the Border Patrol as it bolstered its ranks. And in 2010, then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced a border security plan that included Guard reconnaissance, aerial patrolling and military exercises.\n\nIn July 2014, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to the border when the surge of migrant children fleeing violence in Central America overwhelmed U.S. officials responsible for their care. The Guard troops' stated role on the border at the time was to provide extra sets of eyes but not make arrests.\n\nBush initiated the federal 287(g) program — named for a section of a 1996 immigration law — to allow specially trained local law enforcement officials to participate in immigration enforcement on the streets and check whether people held in local jails were in the country illegally. ICE trained and certified roughly 1,600 officers to carry out those checks from 2006 to 2015.\n\nThe memo describes the program as a \"highly successful force multiplier\" that identified more than 402,000 \"removable aliens.\"\n\nBut federal watchdogs were critical of how DHS ran the program, saying it was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers, including on civil rights law. Obama phased out all the arrest power agreements in 2013 to instead focus on deporting recent border crossers and immigrants in the country illegally who posed a safety or national security threat.\n\nTrump's immigration strategy emerges as detentions at the nation's southern border are down significantly from levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Last year, the arrest tally was the fifth-lowest since 1972. Deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally also increased under the Obama administration, though Republicans criticized Obama for setting prosecution guidelines that spared some groups from the threat of deportation, including those brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nLast week, ICE officers arrested more than 680 people around the country in what Kelly said were routine, targeted operations; advocates called the actions stepped-up enforcement under Trump.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/17"}]}

During Candlemas, Christians would light candles to predict how long winter would last.\n\nThe first official Groundhog Day was held Feb. 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. According to History.com, we can thank newspaper editor Clymer Freas for the special day, as he and a group of groundhog hunters declared a groundhog from the town as the official predictor.\n\nToday, the ceremony is organized by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, which also cares for the groundhog year-round.\n\nWhen is Groundhog Day 2024?\n\nGroundhog Day occurs each year on Feb. 2. This year, Groundhog Day falls on a Friday.\n\nGroundhog Day is not a federal holiday, so banks, mail and trash services, schools, grocery stores, federal offices, local governments, libraries and stock markets will be open. But in Punxsutawney, celebrations featuring talent shows, banquets and performances are held to commemorate the day.\n\nDid Punxsutawney Phil see his shadow?\n\nArguably the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, did not see his shadow Friday morning, meaning an early spring is on its way.\n\nDid Buckeye Chuck see his shadow?\n\nThe groundhog did emerge from his bunker, which, according to Ohio lore, means we can expect an early spring.\n\nWhat does it mean if the groundhog sees its shadow?\n\nIn theory, if Phil sees his shadow, we can expect six more weeks of winter weather. If Phil doesn't see his shadow, we can expect an early spring.\n\nLast year, the groundhog predicted a longer winter. This year, Phil did not see his shadow, predicting an early spring.\n\nBut how accurate are Phil's predictions? The Stormfax Weather Almanac says the groundhog is only correct about 39% of the time.

But don't blame the groundhogs: Research indicates they emerge in February not to see their shadow, but to, well, get frisky.\n\nIf you didn't know that about the large squirrel, which is the most widespread North American marmot species, there's probably a lot you don't know about the humble groundhog.\n\nHere are some facts about the stocky, solitary critters that you might not have heard before:\n\nHow accurate is Punxsutawney Phil?His Groundhog Day predictions aren't great, data shows.\n\nGroundhogs are 'true hibernators' – unlike those bear imposters\n\nWhile hibernation is common among many animals, groundhogs enter a level of winter dormancy that is more unusual.\n\nUnlike, say, bears, groundhogs don’t just enter a light-sleep state characterized by inactivity. Rather, the creatures’ reduced metabolism, slower heart rate, and lowered body temperature make them what experts consider to be “true hibernators,” according to the National Park Service.\n\nWhile hibernating, a groundhog's body temperature can drop from about 99 degrees Fahrenheit to as low as 37 degrees, a temperature cold enough to be fatal to humans, who lose consciousness at about 82 degrees. Similarly, the heart rate of a hibernating groundhog slows from about 80 beats per minute to just five, while breathing slows from around 16 breaths per minute to as few as two, according to the National Wildlife Federation.\n\nAfter fattening up in the warmer seasons, groundhogs spend nearly three months – or 150 days – hibernating without eating a single thing. But their generous food stores mean the animals are unlikely to lose more than a fourth of their body weight, the NWF said.\n\nThe reason groundhogs actually emerge in February\n\nNot to worry though: Woodchucks called upon for winter prognosticating duties on Groundhog Day aren't necessarily being unnaturally stirred.\n\nResearchers have found that groundhogs do in fact emerge from their dens in early February, but not to determine whether they’ll see their shadow, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Rather, it’s believed that males will rouse themselves around this time to wander their territories in search of a potential mate, the National Wildlife Federations said.\n\nOnce they find a burrow belonging to a suitable female, the male will enter and spend the night. Before you raise your eyebrows, no funny business is taking place – yet. Research suggests that the visit is just to allow the animals time to get to know each other (think of it as a blind date, of sorts.)\n\nThat way, when they emerge from hibernating for good in March, they’re ready to get down to business.\n\nWhat big, sharp teeth groundhogs have\n\nWith a voracious appetite, groundhogs are known to put away more than one pound of vegetation in one sitting. According to the NWF, that’s akin to a 150-pound human scarfing down a 15-pound steak.\n\nThough the herbivores only feast on veggies, groundhogs still have formidable teeth.\n\nTheir upper and lower incisors can grow about a sixteenth of an inch each week. If not properly ground down while they gnaw away on their food, they grown to look like the tusks of a wild boar.\n\nAnd if their incisors grow too long, the animals can fatally impale their lower jaw, the NWF said.\n\nIntricate groundhog burrows provide protection from predators\n\nExtensive burrow systems created by groundhogs are designed to serve as protection from predatory enemies.\n\nThe animals’ homes can be up to six feet deep with 20 feet of weaving chambers and tunnels leading to at least two exits – and sometimes nearly a dozen. The design provides a crucial advantage to a fleeing groundhog, which is otherwise relatively slow moving compared to invading animals like foxes who may see them as little more than a yummy dinner, the NWF said.\n\nHuman activity has shaped the animals’ natural habitat, which covers a wide geographic range and many ecosystems, from low elevation forests to small woodlots, fields and pastures. Forest-clearing, road-building and human agriculture have been a net good for groundhogs, increasing their access to food and providing them places to construct their dens, according to the Animal Diversity Web operated by the University of Michigan.\n\nHumans, though, may not always see the mammals themselves as a benefit to have around. Groundhogs are known to destroy gardens, pastures, and agricultural crops, while their burrows have been known to injure livestock and damage farm equipment and building foundations.\n\nGroundhogs like to be alone, and will hiss and bark to keep it that way\n\nWhile groundhogs males are known to fraternize with multiple mates per season, that’s about as social as the species is known to be.\n\nEven those interactions are limited purely to reproduction, as the male doesn’t stick around to rear his own offspring, according to the University of Michigan.\n\nThe older, more dominant male groundhogs tend to be territorial – aggressively lording over their dominions while the younger ones are left to be nomadic.\n\nThough not known for their friendliness, groundhogs will sometimes great each other nose to nose.\n\nMore often, though, they react to unwelcome guests by arching their bodies, baring their teeth and raising their tails. According to the University of Michigan, they also hiss, growl, shriek, whistle, teeth-chatter, bark and even fight to ward off predators or establish social rank.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Subscribe to The Checklist newsletter for expert product advice and recommendations.\n\nWhat is Groundhog Day?\n\nGroundhog Day is one of the quirkier holidays we celebrate. Every year, people observe a groundhog as it emerges from hibernation. Whether or not it sees its shadow determines if spring will come early or if we'll have to buckle down for a long winter. Groundhog Day traces its roots back to the ancient Christian tradition of Candlemas, in which the number of candles given by clergymen would determine the length of winter. This tradition morphed in Germany to use badgers and hedgehogs to determine the length of winter. When German settlers came to America where hedgehogs and badgers were less abundant, they decided to use groundhogs instead.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe biggest Groundhog Day celebration has taken place at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since 1887. Tens of thousands gather to watch the rodent meteorologist, \"Punxsutawney Phil,\" make his appearance.\n\nWhen is Groundhog Day 2023?\n\nGroundhog Day is observed annually on February 2. This year, Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his burrow at sunrise around 6:30 AM EST.\n\nWhat does it mean if the groundhog sees its shadow?\n\nIt is said that if the groundhog sees its shadow (due to the sky being clear and the sun casting a shadow), there will be six additional weeks of winter. If the groundhog doesn't see its shadow due to cloudy weather, then spring will come early.\n\nResults of Groundhog Day 2023\n\nThursday morning at sunrise, Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his burrow and saw his shadow, meaning that it’s predicted that we will have an additional six weeks of winter in the U.S.\n\nProducts to get through the next six weeks of winter\n\n1. The classic Groundhog Day movie\n\nAs today is Groundhog Day, it’s only right that you stream the famous Bill Murray classic. Did you know that the release of 1993's Groundhog Day sparked a renewed interest in the holiday? Attendance of the event in Punxsutawney soared from around 2,000 in 1993 to an average of 10,000 the following years. If you'd like to watch it to commemorate the holiday, you can stream it online.\n\n2. A snow shovel\n\nSince six more weeks of winter weather are forecasted, there's a good chance you'll have to deal with more snow. Where there's snow, there's a need for a quality shovel to clear it all from your sidewalk and driveway. Even if you have a shovel already, it might be worth looking into one that's more comfortable to use. Enter: ergonomic snow shovels. The best of them is the Snow Joe SJ-SHLV20, which has a dual handle to minimize back pain and a shape that eliminates the dead lift required from most other snow shovels.\n\n3. A snowblower\n\nSnow shoveling can be a drag, especially if you live in an area where snowstorms are frequent. Consider investing in a snow blower to clear snow more efficiently. The Snow Joe SJ625E is the best snow blower you can buy, clearing both huge driveways and tiny sidewalks with ease. As it’s electric instead of gas-powered, it will last a long time without the need for maintenance.\n\n4. A self-heating pet bed\n\nBelieve it or not, your pets can get cold, too, especially if they have little to no fur. If you notice them shivering or trying to bundle up, it's best to get something to keep them comfortable for the long winter ahead. To this end, we recommend getting them a self-heating bed. We tried this one and found it to be highly successful in keeping furry friends warm. While it was tested on a dog, we imagine a cat would like it just as much.\n\n5. A space heater\n\nA space heater will help you stay cozy no matter how cold the temperatures outside drop. Just make sure to adhere to proper safety practices when using one. The best space heater we've tested is the DeLonghi HMP1500. It can be wall-mounted, it’s easy to move and provides a great amount of heat for medium-sized spaces.\n\n6. An electric blanket\n\nGiven that you shouldn't use a space heater while you're sleeping, you'll need to use something else to stay warm while getting some shuteye. We recommend using an electric blanket, specifically the Sunbeam Velvet Plush Cozy Feet Heated Blanket. This is our favorite electric blanket because of its larger size options, consistent heating throughout the blanket, soft fabric and feet pockets to keep your toes warm as you sleep.\n\n7. Winter boots\n\nEveryone should have a pair of quality winter boots. The best winter pair of men’s winter boots are the Kamik NationPlus Boot. Like any good pair of winter boots, they're both insulated and water-resistant, protecting your feet from the snow. Beyond that, they're quite comfortable. The best pair of women's winter boots are the Sorel Women's Caribou Boots. They have great insulation, a durable rubber sole to keep the rest of the boot away from the snow and feature removable, soft liner.\n\n8. A slow cooker\n\nOne advantage of a long winter is that you have more excuses to eat warm meals. Chili? Stew? Whatever warm dish your stomach desires will taste even more satisfying in a quality slow cooker. The Cuisinart 6-Quart 3-in-1 Cook Central Multicooker is the best slow cooker we've tested thanks to its temperature retention, user-friendly interface and convenient handles for carrying. Finally, it's dishwasher safe, making it easy to clean.\n\n9. A humidifier\n\nAlong with the cold, there’s another struggle of wintry weather that can be quite uncomfortable: the lack of humidity. Winter air can be very dry, leading to flaky, uncomfortable skin—even nosebleeds. To stay comfortable throughout this last stretch of winter, consider using a humidifier. Out of all the humidifiers we've tested, we found the Levoit Classic 300S to be the best. It boasts a high capacity so you don’t have to add water too often and a high output of moisture, all while being incredibly quiet.\n\n10. An electric kettle\n\nWhether you prefer tea, coffee or hot cocoa to warm you up in the wintertime, an electric kettle makes boiling water easy and quick. Electric kettles don't get much better than the Cuisinart PerfecTemp CPK-17, which sports intuitive controls, short boiling times and several presets to get your brew at the perfect temperature.\n\n11. A travel mug\n\nThe hard thing about winter often isn't staying in your home, but rather braving the cold temperature outdoors. To keep yourself warm on the go, we suggest picking up a good travel mug to carry around a hot beverage. When it comes to travel mugs, the Zojirushi SM-KHE48 excels at temperature retention, staying toasty even if left in the mug overnight.\n\n12. A weighted blanket\n\nNothing quite beats the warm hug that is laying beneath a weighted blanket. To get through the next six weeks warm and relaxed, we recommend using the Gravity blanket. It’s made from high-quality material that will last for a long time. Not to mention, it’s super soft, easy to clean and its weight provides the perfect amount of pressure.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Will Phil see his shadow?", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt's that time of year again when meteorologists step aside to let a furry rodent make its famed weather forecast.\n\nPunxsutawney Phil, the world's celebrity groundhog, will be coaxed from his burrow in western Pennsylvania early Thursday as an anxious nation watches to find out whether we'll have an early spring or six more miserable weeks of cold and snow.\n\nAccording to legend, if it's sunny and Phil sees his shadow, the scared groundhog returns to his burrow and the U.S. will endure six more weeks of winter. But if it's cloudy when the groundhog emerges on Feb. 2, the critter won't see his shadow and will leave his burrow, meaning winter will soon end and an early start to spring is coming.\n\nThe forecast for Thursday morning in Punxsutawney, Pa., calls for mostly cloudy skies and a slight chance of snow, but Phil is a fickle fuzzball, so who knows what he'll do?\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center, in its official forecast for February released Tuesday, calls for warmer-than-average temperatures for almost the entire U.S.\n\nUnfortunately, based on past weather data, \"there is no predictive skill for the groundhog during the most recent years of the analysis,\" according to a report released this week by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C.\n\nFlipping a coin might be as accurate as Phil. Since 1988, the groundhog was \"right\" 14 times and \"wrong\" 15 times. In other words, only 14 times did the national average temperature for the remainder of February match what would be expected based on what the groundhog predicted.\n\nBut last year, Phil was spot on: The fuzzy rodent didn't see his shadow, so winter should have been over. And both February and March ended up warmer than average across the nation, NOAA said. In fact every state in the contiguous U.S. had an above-average March temperature.\n\nSince 1887, the groundhog has seen his shadow 102 times, to forecast a longer winter, and not seen it 18 times, to predict an early spring. (There is no record of the prediction for 10 times in the late 19th century.)\n\nWhile Groundhog Day is just some mid-winter fun, climate records say that winter probably isn't over, according to NOAA.
