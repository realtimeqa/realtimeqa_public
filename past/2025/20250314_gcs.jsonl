The Senate will be decided by a handful of close races. If the GOP takes one or both chambers, they will be in a position to kill Biden’s domestic legislative agenda. Still, they’ll struggle to get policies past the president’s veto, which requires a two-thirds majority to override. The next two years could see America run by a divided government, with angry standoffs, financial showdowns and partisan investigations.\n\nWhat is happening on Tuesday?\n\nIn the House, all 435 seats are up for grabs, where lawmakers serve two-year terms. Democrats currently narrowly control the chamber, but Republicans need only a net gain of five seats to take the majority.\n\nIn the 100-seat Senate, a total of 35 seats are being contested. The chamber where incumbents serve for six years is split 50-50, and Democrats currently have control since Vice President Kamala Harris wields a tie-breaking vote. But Republicans only require a net gain of a single seat to take control.\n\nThere are also a number of other races to watch, including 36 governorship contests, and many more lower positions. Races for state-level Secretaries of State have taken on extra significance this year, since they control state elections —including the 2024 presidential race. There are also elections for state legislatures and ballot initiatives on issues including access to abortion, changes to voting systems, gun control measures and the legalization of marijuana for recreation.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nAt every election, candidates tell voters that this is the most critical election of their lifetimes. This time they may be right.\n\nA Republican wave would sweep in scores of candidates who swear by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The former President would likely weaponize a Republican-controlled House against Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential vote; Rep. Kevin McCarthy – who would likely become Republican Speaker if Republicans win – has not ruled out impeaching Biden, despite the absence of any evidence that he’s committed an impeachable offense.\n\nA surprise Democratic victory would allow Biden to build upon his social, health, and climate change legislation, and to balance out the judiciary with liberal judges after four years of Trump’s conservative picks.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House.

Hear his answer 02:29\n\nWhat issues will decide the election?\n\nThe cliché, “It’s the economy, stupid,” which dates to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, is everywhere this election season. But it should be, “It’s inflation, stupid.” The US cost of living is at a 40-year-high, putting voters in a disgruntled mood. High gasoline prices haven’t helped either, and the sense of post-pandemic normality that Biden promised remains elusive.\n\nThe President has struggled to frame the economic challenges into a strong political message or to give voters any confidence that prices will fall soon. Some Democrats are now asking whether their candidates ignored the true concerns of voters by spending so much time arguing that Republicans would destroy US democracy.\n\nDemocrats had hoped that the conservative Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion would cause a backlash against the GOP. This could play out in some areas – but the economy has repeatedly been the dominant concern of voters in polling ahead of Election Day.\n\nRepublicans haven’t had to work too hard — their strategy has just been to blame Biden for everything — even though inflation is being driven mostly by outside factors like the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. They’ve also branded Democratic positions on education, crime, and immigration as extreme and far left of the mainstream.\n\nWhat to watch for on Election Night\n\nHouse bellwethers: The best way to watch results roll in is to pick a few bellwether races that will give a sense of where the election is headed. If Republicans start winning big in suburban areas and House districts where Biden was far more popular than Trump in 2020, it’s a good bet they are heading for a banner night.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Midterm elections: Here are the House races to watch 02:13 - Source: CNN Midterm elections: Here are the House races to watch 02:13\n\nGiven the narrow margin in the House, Republicans could effectively win the majority by sweeping contested seats in a state like New York alone. One fateful battle is in a new seat created from the post-Census reapportionment – Colorado’s 8th Congressional District; if Republicans win, they are on a roll.\n\nAnother tight race is in Virginia’s 7th District, where former CIA officer and Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is trying to win reelection against a Trumpy conservative, Republican Yesli Vega. If Democrats can hold on in this redrawn district, which became more favorable for them in redistricting, it won’t mean they’ll win the House, but it could signal they keep the GOP surge below landslide levels. Spanberger, one of Democrats’ strongest incumbents, hasn’t hesitated to criticize the president or her party.\n\nAnd keep an eye on Michigan’s 7th District, where another former CIA employee and Democratic Rep Elissa Slotkin is running for reelection. Slotkin is a moderate who distanced herself from soaring progressive policies and criticized her party for not doing more to address the economic pain Americans face.\n\nSenate battlegrounds: In the Senate, keep an eye on neck-and-neck battles in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia. If Democratic Sen Maggie Hassan loses her reelection bid in New Hampshire, it’s a sure sign it’s the GOP’s night.\n\nPennsylvania represents the best chance for Democrats to pick up a Republican-held seat, but their candidate John Fetterman had a stroke just before winning the party nomination in May. Even off the campaign trail over the summer, Fetterman had the upper hand against his Republican challenger, but the pair’s recent debate opened up new questions about how the lingering effects of the stroke on the Democratic nominee.\n\nRepublicans are trying to win Democratic-held seats in Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia. If neither candidate in Georgia gets 50% of the vote, there will be a run-off in December, meaning uncertainty over who runs the Senate for the next two years could linger for weeks.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These 3 races may determine the fate of the Senate 03:40 - Source: CNN These 3 races may determine the fate of the Senate 03:40\n\nWhat the election means for American democracy\n\nThis is the first national election since the cataclysm of 2020 when Trump refused to admit defeat and tried to stay in power. Biden took office two weeks later with a message of healing and national unity. But his vision that America’s better angels could bring a polarized country together has fizzled. Trump still won’t admit he lost, and is using the lie that he was forced illegally from power to catapult an expected bid for reelection. Millions of Americans believe him, creating intensity among core supporters that could sweep the GOP back to power in Congress.\n\nOne key development to watch Tuesday is whether Republicans who lose their races concede, or like Trump insist they won and cite non-existent ballot irregularities. Another source of tension will arise in races where it appears Republicans are leading vote counts until large batches of early and mail-in ballots are tabulated all at once. Trump used such a scenario to falsely cast doubts on the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nWhat happens if the Republican Party wins power?\n\nWe don’t need to guess. The GOP is already telling us it will make life miserable for Biden and try to destroy his hopes of reelection. McCarthy told CNN in an exclusive interview that he plans to subject the White House to a blistering round of investigations on everything from the origins of Covid-19 to the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy tells CNN first bill would be on border security if GOP wins House 02:05 - Source: CNN McCarthy tells CNN first bill would be on border security if GOP wins House 02:05\n\nThe GOP also plans to target Biden’s son Hunter over his business dealings, and will seek to discredit and disrupt the FBI and Justice Department investigations into Trump. In the Senate, a Republican majority would make it extraordinarily difficult for Biden to confirm cabinet appointments, key officials foreign ambassadors and judges. Expect a period of acrimonious standoffs over budgets and the US government’s borrowing limit — a crisis that could send the global economy into deeper turmoil.\n\nWhat does this election mean for Biden?\n\nHistory shows that newly elected presidents almost always face a backlash in the midterm elections two years later. That’s why they jam top legislative priorities into the start of their term.\n\nIf Democrats don’t do as badly as some fear, Biden will get a boost as he contemplates whether to run for reelection. If Republicans win big, fresh questions will arise over his prospects in 2024.The president will be 80 in a few weeks — an occasion to celebrate, but also an unwanted reminder of his own political liabilities.\n\nIt’s not all dark for the president, though. His two Democratic predecessors Bill Clinton and Barack Obama suffered debilitating rebukes from voters in the midterms, but recovered to win easy reelection two years later. The question is whether Biden has the energy and political dexterity to use what would be an extreme Republican Congress as a foil.\n\nWhat does this election mean for Trump?\n\nThe former president has made the midterms a test of loyalty for Republicans, who have had to pay for his endorsement by amplifying his false claims of election fraud in 2020. GOP leaders would have preferred that Trump stay out of the election entirely — but that’s not how he rolls.\n\nTrump was instrumental in his party losing the House in 2018 and the Senate and the White House in 2020, and it’s possible he will again be a spoiler since the protégés he picked in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Ohio have big liabilities as candidates. If Republicans do well on Tuesday night, Trump will take the credit. If they don’t meet expectations, he will blame everybody else.\n\nEither way, the ex-President seems certain to run again in 2024 — a campaign that could trigger a political meltdown since there’s a chance he’ll be indicted over his hoarding of classified documents or over his malfeasance after the 2020 election.\n\nBut here’s the bottom line. A Republican win Tuesday, especially in the House, means that two years after he left in disgrace — Trumpism is back in power.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/01/15/trump-greenland-poll/77668938007/", "title": "Do Americans want Trump to acquire Greenland? Half say no.", "text": "America and Greenland share a continent. They both have water on their East and West sides. The cost of living and number of airports is different, as is the size of their populations and their geography.\n\nBut according to a new poll that asked Americans what they think of President-elect Donald Trump's plan to acquire Greenland, they have another thing in common: People in both countries think it's not a great idea.\n\nEven for an elected president with a track record of surprising proposals, Trump's floated suggestion to take over the Arctic territory was met with widespread shock, according to an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nThe survey broadly mirrors anecdotal evidence that has emerged from Greenland in recent days in which people have been expressing consternation and confusion, but also a limited degree of excitement at Trump's proposal.\n\nMore than half say it's a bad idea; among those who think it's a good idea, the majority think it's unrealistic, according to an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nOf 1,000 people polled from Jan. 7 to Jan. 11, 53% didn't support acquiring Greenland, 29% thought it was a good idea but didn't think it could realistically happen, and just 11% said the Trump administration should do everything it can to make it a reality.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the vast majority of Democrats – 86% – were opposed to taking Greenland. But among Republicans, just 23% said Trump should pursue the policy, while around half – 48% – said it was good but unrealistic and 21% said it was not a good plan.\n\n'The most stupid thing I ever heard'\n\nGray Holland, 23, cast his ballot for Trump in November in the hopes Trump would cut funding for Ukraine and crack down on immigration. But taking over Greenland, Holland said, seemed like a bad joke.\n\n\"I thought it was funny at first, him joking about that idea,\" said Gray, who lives in Cary, North Carolina, and works in sports tickets operations. \"But once he started actually talking about military deployment … no, I cannot get behind that.\"\n\nSome Democrats had harsher words for the idea. \"That’s the most stupid thing I've ever heard,\" said Daniel Ander, 68, a retired civil engineer from Port Orchard, Washington. Trump \"likes to do all this chaos so you don't really realize nothing's happening. He's just creating chaos.\"\n\nTrump has floated the idea of buying Greenland since his election victory in November. But last week, he also refused to rule out taking over the territory through military force.\n\nWhy Greenland? Trump says the U.S. needs it for \"national security purposes.\" Although the U.S. already has a military base on the island, Russian and Chinese ships are \"all over the place,\" he said.\n\nSome Americans point out Greenland's natural resources\n\nGreenland's land is also rich with minerals and natural resources that could make the U.S. less economically reliant on China in some sectors.\n\nChristy Rangel, 51, an independent who leans Democratic, compared Trump's designs on Greenland to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. \"He looks up to Putin, and Putin just went into Ukraine and took it,\" Rangel said, referring to Trump's past praise of Putin as a \"genius\" for launching the invasion. \"That's what he thinks he can do with Greenland.\"\n\nRangel, a legal secretary from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said she thought Trump wanted only to monetize Greenland's natural wealth. \"It's a play for getting resources that he can then sell,\" she said.\n\nStill, some of Trump's steadfast supporters stood by his ambitions to take the 836,000-square-mile island. \"I think that’s great,\" said Cynthia Harrison, 57, a Republican from Stowe, Vermont, who worked at a ski resort before she retired. \"There's all kinds of rare-earth minerals up there,\" and \"the Chinese and the Russians keep getting closer and closer.\"\n\nGreenland has been a territory of Denmark since the 19th century. It has its own parliament, which oversees some domestic and civil affairs. Laws pertaining to Greenland's defense, national security and economy are controlled by policymakers in Denmark. Trump has refused to rule out using economic or even military force to take control of the vast ice-covered territory.\n\nGreenlanders have been debating for a numbers of years whether they would be better off as an independent country, something that could happen if a national referendum is held, which Denmark has said it would allow if enough of the population votes to hold one. Polls have consistently shown that most Greenlanders would prefer to be independent, but only if they don't lose a standard of living that for now is buttressed by Denmark's welfare state.\n\nWikistrat, a global risks consultancy, recently ran a series of simulations aimed at trying understand how the Greenland saga could play out.\n\nIn one of the simulations, the U.S. would offer to lease Greenland from Denmark for an extended period or time, similar to what China did with its Hong King territory when it leased it to Britain for 99 years from 1898 to 1997. In another, Greenland would grant what Wikistrat called \"minority shares\" in its governance to the U.S., primarily in the areas of security and foreign policy. The U.S. would assume about $800 million in annual subsidies now provided by Denmark.\n\nIn a third, more aggressive scenario, the U.S. would unilaterally expand its military presence in Greenland, deploying additional troops to the Thule Air Base, upgrade its missile defense systems there and establish new Arctic-capable infrastructure.\n\nIt would also impose tariffs on Danish exports and restrictions on Greenlandic trade. This increased U.S. presence, according to Wikistrat, would trigger a forceful response from Russia, which would view the militarization of Greenland as a direct threat to its Arctic interests.\n\nEventually, under sustained pressure and fearing Russian actions, Denmark would agree to grant the U.S. special status in managing Greenland’s security and foreign affairs, further solidifying the U.S. presence, according to the consultancy.\n\n(This story was updated to fix a typo.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/20/dnc-delegates-rollcall-state-songs/74881321007/", "title": "From 'California Love' to 'Texas Hold 'Em', DNC roll call honors each ...", "text": "The Democratic National Convention ceremonial roll call set celebrated both national and state pride through music.\n\nAs Democrat delegates announced their votes for Vice President Kamala Harris, record producer DJ Cassidy played a unique song representing each state.\n\nTennessee delegates jammed out to Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" while Texas took it to the floor with Houston-native Beyoncé's \"Texas Hold 'Em.\"\n\nNew York Gov.

This is because − like them or not − they have to work with the eventual winner.\n\n\"I take the leaders that the people give me,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said recently.\n\nTrump's loudest critics: He got some world affairs right\n\nBut in private some allies say they are preparing for a revenge presidency that might actively work against European interests − a dictator-loving administration that could turn its back on NATO while descending into chaos and political theater.\n\n\"We now know how Trump likes to operate. He likes to surprise us. He has a transactional approach. In this regard, we won't be surprised,\" said a senior official from a major Western European country who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"But if Trump wins it will still be a shock.\"\n\nThe official added: \"We often say American presidential elections have the fate of the world in their hands. That idea is usually overstated. This time, it really could be true because the two candidates have a very, very different approach to international affairs and working constructively with their allies.\"\n\n'Is Trump really the guy you are going to go for again?'\n\nAs president, Trump slashed and burned his way through international agreements and commitments on climate change, trade, troop deployments, public health, nuclear weapons and more.\n\nHe spread false information, routinely used inflammatory language and disparaged leaders of friendly nations like Britain and Germany while lavishing praise on strongmen including Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán.\n\nTrump referred to African countries, Haiti and El Salvador as \"s---hole\" nations.\n\nHe boasted he \"saved\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman after U.S. intelligence concluded MBS, as the kindgom's de facto leader is known, had ordered the gruesome daylight killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi consulate in Turkey. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, was a critic of the crown prince.\n\nAfter all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government directed cyberattacks on members of the Democratic Party during the 2016 election, Trump, after a meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, said he didn't \"see any reason why\" Russia would be responsible.\n\nIn North Korea, experts say, Trump handed brutal dictator Kim Jong Un a powerful propaganda victory by holding fruitless and self-aggrandizing summits. He also exited a deal between Iran and world powers that appeared to be curbing Tehran's nuclear development, banned nationals of six Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the U.S. for ninety days and rolled back improving ties with Cuba.\n\n\"There is a huge level of dismay and disbelief in Europe among our allies. They are saying: 'Are you really going to do this again? Is Trump really going to be the guy you go for again?'\" said Lewis Lukens, a retired U.S. diplomat. Lukens was abruptly fired as the No. 2 official at the U.S. embassy in London in 2018 by the Trump-appointed ambassador after speaking positively of former President Barack Obama in a speech to English college students.\n\n\"The first four years of Trump put a lot of stress on American institutions and the country internationally that caused a lot of damage to our allies with his erratic, uncertain policies,\" said John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump.\n\nBolton has become one of Trump's loudest critics to emerge from his White House. He said a second Trump term could damage the U.S. and its allies in ways \"that simply cannot be repaired.\"\n\nMore recently, Trump has appeared to talk fast and loose about abandoning Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing has vowed to reunite with the Chinese mainland − by force if necessary.\n\nTrump has also warned NATO allies he would encourage Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that don't pay their way in the alliance. He has said he would consider letting Russia \"take over\" parts of Ukraine in a deal to end the war − and that he could easily resolve it in a single day.\n\nTrump's \"approach to international affairs is a matter of concern for us,\" said a senior Taiwanese lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe U.S., France's leader says, is 'a democracy in crisis'\n\nBiden swiftly jettisoned Trump’s \"America First\" nationalism upon taking office.\n\nHe rebuilt relationships with allies and rejoined international pacts such as the Paris agreement on climate change. He rallied NATO and helped win the inclusion of two new members, long-neutral Finland and Sweden, in the face of Russia's Ukraine invasion. He halted the U.S. departure from the World Health Organization, which Trump had denigrated.\n\nNow that Biden is 81, polls show many Americans are concerned about his age. Like Trump, he appears to make frequent verbal flubs and sometimes confuses the names of world leaders. If U.S. allies believe Biden is too old, they aren't saying. Biden has also stirred global anger, including among many allies, for failing to restrain Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\"How many times have you heard the most prominent leaders and foreign ministers around the world saying too many people are being killed?\" the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said last month after Biden remarked that Israel's conduct in the war was \"over the top.\"\n\nFrance's leader Macron has cautioned that regardless of who wins the White House in November, Europe should brace for the possibility that, long-term, U.S. priorities may lie elsewhere.\n\n\"They share our values, but it is a democracy that is also going through crisis,” Macron said, adding that the United States' \"first priority is itself.\" Macron said America's second priority is China. In recent days, Macron has floated the idea that Western countries may need to be prepared to send troops to Ukraine.\n\nNATO troops in Ukraine? French proposal brings a warning from Russia\n\nAnd Trump, 77, does have some supporters among U.S. allies.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister who has argued for a much more aggressive Israeli approach to its war with Hamas in Gaza, in which at least 30,000 people have been killed over the past five months and the U.N. says famine is \"inevitable,\" recently said Biden was not giving Israel his \"full backing.\"\n\nBen-Gvir said, without elaborating, \"if Trump was in power, the U.S. conduct would be completely different.\"\n\nSimilarly, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose populist politics have often been compared to Trump's, argued in a recent newspaper column that \"a Trump presidency could be just what the world needs.\"\n\nAnother senior European official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Trump's recent comments about NATO, as well as his threats to withdraw from the alliance while he was president, were \"very disturbing\" and \"counterproductive\" because they undermined faith in collective security arrangements.\n\nThe official said that if Trump is reelected, he threatens to upend U.S.-European relations at a time when they have been on a \"very good track,\" not least because of cooperation over Ukraine.\n\nAs Ukraine runs low on ammunition and weapons, Trump-supporting Republicans are already blocking congressional funding that could prove decisive in Kyiv's battle to stop a recent Russian military advance.\n\nThe official said that Europe would not be helpless if Trump were to pursue policies it considered unhelpful and that the region had \"possible leverages\" to pressure him, such as on trade.\n\nThis is what autocracy looks like: jailed for speaking out\n\nThere are also those who believe fears over a Trump 2.0 presidency are overblown.\n\n\"When I became foreign minister in 2019, it was still Trump times and it was impossible to talk to his then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about climate change or biodiversity or things like that,\" said Pekka Haavisto, a Finnish lawmaker who, as the Nordic country's top diplomat, negotiated its NATO membership.\n\n\"But on Russia, China, the Middle East, we did have intensive engagement.\"\n\nHaavisto recalled asking NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, \"How was it in NATO during Trump?\" He said Stoltenberg replied: \"Despite all of Trump's rhetoric, the U.S. kept all its economic commitments. And it also kept all of its personnel commitments. So actually it was a normal time for NATO.\"\n\nA senior security official in Europe who requested anonymity agreed with this assessment. The official said Europe saw \"historic increases in defense spending,\" and this was \"driven by strong U.S. urging.\"\n\nIn other words, Trump was right to give NATO members a nudge on spending, even if he did it impolitely − and while threatening to ditch the U.S.-led alliance.\n\nHanno Pevkur, Estonia's defense minister, said it's clear to many in Estonia that Trump's fiery rhetoric is aimed at domestic audiences. He said that because NATO enjoys widespread bipartisan support in Congress, he did not believe it mattered too much \"who is the next U.S. president.\"\n\nAnother senior official from Eastern Europe also balked at the idea, reportedly suggested by a German lawmaker at the Munich Security Conference last month, that a second Trump administration would mean a world where Europe is competing with \"three autocracies: China, Russia and the U.S.\"\n\n\"Yes, Trump can be very outspoken. He can push lines. But the U.S. has an independent judiciary system. You have freedom of speech. Nobody's going to throw you in jail for saying something about a president or an official. That's what autocracy is,\" they said.\n\nDaniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington think tank, said a lot of America's overseas relationships are \"pretty institutionalized\" and amount to a major check on presidential power.\n\nHe said Trump would be limited, as he was last time around, in what he could do by longstanding institutions, official bureaucracy and the people around him. \"He wouldn't be the only one making important calls\" on foreign policy, DePetris said.\n\nNot ready for the panic stations\n\nStill, Trump's former national security adviser Bolton said he thinks U.S. allies aren't panicking yet because they aren't convinced Trump is actually going to win.\n\n\"They're worried about it. They wouldn't look forward to another four years with him. I don't think they have yet really internalized just how bad it could be,\" Bolton said.\n\n\"Take the example of a NATO withdrawal. They see it as a possibility, but they fundamentally don't think that any American president would do it. And that, I believe, is the triumph of hope over experience,\" Bolton warned.\n\nYet, like Bolton, many of the former first-term senior Trump officials who claimed they stood between the former president and his worst impulses − such as wanting to bomb Iran or North Korea − have now broken with him.\n\nWho would restrain him in a second term?\n\n\"In any Trump job interview, the most important question will be: 'Will you do what I tell you to do and not offer your opinion?' And if the answer to that question is yes, then you're probably going to get hired.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't return a request for comment.\n\nSaudis' man in America\n\nAli al-Ahmed, a Saudi scholar and dissident, framed a possible Trump return another way.\n\nAfter Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner left the White House, where he had been a senior adviser, and helped cultivate close ties with Mohammed bin Salman, he started a private equity firm that received a reported $2 billion investment from the sovereign wealth fund controlled by the crown prince.\n\nKushner has defended the investment, saying everything he did while working in the White House was in the interest of the American people. That's hasn't satisfied Democrats, who have called for an investigation.\n\n\"They want him back,\" Al-Ahmed said of Trump and the Saudis.\n\n\"He is their man.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/02/03/michigan-us-senate-race-gary-peters/78061109007/", "title": "Another huge US Senate race is coming to Michigan", "text": "That respite Michiganders have had from last year's fevered political activity and campaign ads isn't going to last long.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen.

Marco Rubio asking the probing questions.\n\nThe Florida Republican used his perch on the Senate foreign affairs panel to grill Trump secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, for more than ten minutes about Russian election meddling in the most recent election.\n\nOn Wednesday, it will be Rubio’s turn to field uncomfortable questions about Trump’s unorthodox approach to U.S. national security, as his Foreign Relations Committee colleagues publicly vet him for the nation’s top diplomatic post.\n\nSince winning the November election, Trump has made unconventional pitches for the U.S. to take over Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. More immediately, he has pledged swift action to bring home Hamas-held hostages and an end to the yearslong Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nYet, Rubio’s confirmation hearing is expected to be one of the least contentious, with Democratic senators focused on a platter of controversial Trump appointments.\n\n“I think that will be the closest hearing that’s a lovefest of any of the confirmation hearings. I can't say that about the other ones,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sits on the committee, said.\n\nA former presidential candidate and senator of 14 years who served as vice chair of the Senate's famously bipartisan intelligence committee, Rubio is one of Trump’s only Cabinet picks expected to win widespread Democratic support.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio would be the first Latino secretary of state.\n\nHe's well-respected by colleagues and widely seen as an institutionalist, said Emily Horne, a former spokeswoman for the National Security Council in the Biden administration.\n\n“So relative to some of the other Cabinet nominees, who seem to be coming in with a mandate to break the institutions that they're being appointed to lead,” Horne said, “I think there's largely a feeling that Rubio is going to, as secretary of state, execute the administration's foreign policy while not taking a sledgehammer to the foreign service or a whole host of our diplomatic and foreign policy norms.”\n\nRubio has earned a reputation as a China hardliner. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he warned about the deepening ties between Moscow and Beijing. He has advocated for a tougher approach to Venezuela and Cuba and pushed the U.S. to respond more forcefully to China's growing influence in Latin America and its financial relationship with Iran.\n\nAlthough he’s a proponent of foreign assistance to U.S. allies, including Ukraine, Rubio has criticized the Biden administration for refusing to define what victory looks like in that war.\n\n“He's hawkish, like (Trump) is, when America is threatened. At the same time, he doesn't want new boots on the ground forever wars,” former Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien told USA TODAY.\n\nNot only does Rubio share Trump’s peace through strength philosophy, former Rubio chief of staff Cesar Conda said in a statement, his positions on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees gave him “the experience and relationships around the world to carry it out.”\n\nRubio’s first task? Navigating Trump\n\nRubio, who has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011, is viewed as Trump’s most establishment Cabinet pick. And like several of Trump’s nominees, he initially clashed with Trump.\n\nAfter tangling on the campaign trail in 2016, they forged a mutually beneficial partnership during Trump’s first term.\n\nRubio established himself as a leading voice on Latin America, worked closely with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, on increasing the child tax credit and convinced the administration to make him the point man during the pandemic on small business relief.\n\n“He’s proven pretty good at navigating Trump and getting Trump to come around to his viewpoints,” said one former senior aide to Rubio, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly about their dynamic.\n\nThe men became closer when Rubio campaigned with Trump during the 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns. They would spend time together backstage at rallies and on Trump’s private plane, sources familiar with the relationship said.\n\nTrump’s first secretary of state, Tillerson, lasted barely a year. The former energy executive struggled as chief diplomat to a temperamental president who frequently conducts foreign policy through social media posts.\n\nIf confirmed, Rubio will enter the job with the view that the secretary of state's mission is to execute the president's vision and agenda, a source familiar with the senator’s thinking said.\n\nEarly Trump national security appointees didn't understand that the former real estate developer had a \"very well-defined view of the world long before he became president,” O’Brien said.\n\nTrump already has four years as commander in chief under his belt. “So, I think he'll be looking for foreign policy advice from Marco, especially in Latin America, but he's counting on him to be his representative as the secretary of state, the primary diplomat for the United States and the president, abroad,” O’Brien said.\n\nRubio is expected to fare much better than Tillerson. He traveled extensively overseas as a senator, current and former aides said, and understands how the State Department and intelligence agencies work.\n\nAn easy confirmation\n\nIn the lead-up to Rubio’s hearing, senators on both sides of the aisle suggested it would be a walk in the park.\n\n“I know Senator Rubio very well. I have worked with him a long time, and I enthusiastically support his nomination,” Cornyn, R-Texas, said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said, “I know him very well, I’ll probably ask him a lot about Latin America, because I'm not sure other committee members will, and that's a real interest of mine and his, too.”\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, who chaired the Intelligence Committee when Rubio served as ranking member, praised Rubio in a statement as someone who would be a “strong voice for American interests around the globe.”\n\nRepublicans could approve Rubio with GOP-only votes if no one defects. But already, several Democratic senators have signaled their support.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he will vote for Rubio. Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told USA TODAY he wants to hear what Rubio has to say but “he's been very helpful on some issues that I care about,” particularly foreign surveillance.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he was likely to ask about the civil war in Sudan – an issue he's spoken to Rubio about in the past.\n\n“While we don't align on the issues of foreign policy, I know his values, I know his work ethic, there's so many things I respect about Sen. Rubio that make me very inclined to support him,” Booker said.\n\nAs for capturing territories such as Greenland through military force, Booker expressed frustration at the question. “I will not be asking about things that I see as distractions and deflections from the urgent issues going on right now,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/04/what-is-the-blue-wall/76051340007/", "title": "What is the 'blue wall?'

The former Fox and Friends co-host dodged and demurred when confronted over an 8-year-old rape complaint that resulted in no charges and allegations of mismanagement and drinking on the job and said he was the victim of a coordinated smear campaign.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Armed Services Chair, said he was “encouraged” by the hearing. “I think he helped himself immensely.”\n\nThere were no surprises. Democratic senators complained that Hegseth had not been subjected to a thorough FBI background check and that they were unable to gain access to a reportedly scathing whistleblower report from a veterans' nonprofit he had run.\n\nHegseth, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, has scant executive experience. He has described himself as a change agent who will rid the Pentagon of \"woke\" policies he says have made U.S. forces less battle-ready.\n\nTuesday's hearing was an appetizer for a smorgasbord of questions and confrontations expected Wednesday, when six different Senate committees are scheduled to hear from Trump's picks to run the Homeland Security, Justice, State and Transportation departments, as well as the CIA, and the important White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nStay with the USA TODAY Network for live updates.\n\nHegseth confirmation hearing ends with cheers\n\nAfter friendly questions from Sen. Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, the hearing comes to a close. Hegseth and his supporters are embracing and shaking hands as the senators and their staffers file out of the committee room.\n\nCheers break out as he exits.\n\nSlotkin presses on deploying the military at home\n\nSlotkin, a former intelligence officer and acting assistant defense secretary, pressed Hegseth if he would resist an order that conflicts with the Constitution.\n\nShe asked Hegseth if he had been involved in discussions about using the active-duty military within the United States, including detention camps and policing dangerous cities.\n\nHegseth acknowledged that mass deportations could take place in the new administration but declined to say if active-duty troops would take part.\n\nShe accused him of avoiding the questions, and “genuflecting” to Trump.\n\nAsked if Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joints of Staff, would be on a list of officers who could be fired if he becomes Defense secretary, Hegseth said any officer could.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Slotkin asks if Hegseth would 'push back' against an illegal order\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., asked Hegseth about orders that Trump gave his former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, to deploy the military against Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020.\n\n\"Are you saying you would stand in the breach and push back, if you were given an illegal order?\" she said.\n\nHegseth responded that he wouldn't \"get ahead\" of discussions with Trump. But he did not answer directly if he agreed with a public apology Esper made after the 2020 incident.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth brands allegations of public intoxication 'anonymous smears'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, read off several instances of Hegseth's alleged public intoxication through the years, including being drunk in public and in front of young female staffers. Hegseth branded all the allegations \"anonymous smears.\"\n\nWith Hegseth's admissions that he had issues with drinking in the past, \"it's hard to square the circle,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"It's clear to me that you're not being honest with us or the American people,\" because it would be disqualifying, he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat has Pete Hegseth said about women in the military?\n\nDemocratic senators have taken aim at Hegseth’s past comments about women serving in the military. So, what's he said?\n\n“I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles,” Hegseth said on a podcast in November, five days before Trump named him the next Defense secretary. “It hasn't made us more effective, hasn’t made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.\"\n\nIn his recently published book, Hegseth argues that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men.”\n\n“Dads push us to take risks. Moms put the training wheels on our bikes. We need moms. But not in the military, especially in combat units,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nHegseth appeared to backpedal under the scrutiny of the confirmation process, telling reporters in December, \"We support all women serving in our military today who do a fantastic job across the globe, in our Pentagon, and deliver critical aspects.\"\n\n\"So, I look forward to being a leader for every single member of this Pentagon, men and women.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Hegseth told the Senate Armed Services Committee he is \"incredibly grateful\" for the \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military – so long as they meet the required standards.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nRosen presses Hegseth on Ukraine\n\nSen. Jackie Rosen, D-Nev., asked Hegseth if he, and the Trump administration as a whole, would continue U.S. support Ukraine.\n\n\"Are you going to stand behind Ukraine?\" Rosen asked. \"Do you have knowledge of a plan\" Trump will use to end the war in Ukraine? she said.\n\n\"I will always give clear guidance, my best guidance...on matters like that,\" he replied.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth reads soldiers' creed to Hegseth\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth read lines of the soldiers' creed to Hegseth: \"I will always place the mission first,\" and \"I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.\"\n\nDuckworth said Hegseth was unqualified and unprepared to take on the position.\n\n\"You, sir, are a no-go at this station,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDuckworth says Hegseth is 'unqualified' for office\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.. called Hegseth unqualified for the office, questioning his management of the veterans organizations he led and his experience in international affairs.\n\nThe country needs a Defense secretary who is ready on the day he takes office, Duckworth said.\n\n“You are not that person,” Duckworth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWarren digs into Hegseth's women in combat comments\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren dug into Hegseth's comments on women in the military, saying \"I have serious concerns that your behavior toward women disqualifies you.\"\n\nWarren called his backtrack \"a very very big about face in a very very short amount of time.\"\n\n\"What extraordinary event\" in that period of time, she asked, \"made you change the core values you expressed?\"\n\nHegseth said \"standards had been changed\" in pursuit of quotas and percentages in the military.\n\nIf his opinions could be changed so fast, Hegseth could \"go back to the old guy who said, 'straight up, women do not belong in combat roles,'\" once in the role, Warren said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth asked if he would 'abandon' Ukraine\n\nSen. Angus King said he was concerned that Hegseth had not mentioned Ukraine or Russia in his opening statement. \"Is this code for we're going to abandon Ukraine?\" he asked\n\nHegseth said that would be up to Trump, who he said had expressed a desire to end the conflict.\n\nHegseth circumvents questions about Geneva conventions\n\nSen. Angus King, the committee's only independent, asked Hegseth about whether he was opposed to torture and past comments he made that rules of warfare held back the U.S. military.\n\n\"Are you saying that the Geneva Conventions... should not apply in the future?\" King said.\n\nHegseth said he did not condone waterboarding and torture, but he said enemies \"took advantage\" of restrictive rules of war.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nKaine presses Hegseth on disqualifying conduct\n\nUnder questioning from Kaine, Hegseth declined to say if sexual assault, domestic abuse or being drunk at work would disqualify a candidate for Defense secretary.\n\nKaine dismissed Hegseth’s claim that the allegations were from anonymous sources, noting that an email from Hegseth’s mother had been cited by the New York Times.\n\n“Don’t make this into some anonymous press thing,” Kaine said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nKaine delves into Hegseth's infidelity\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., clashed with Hegseth over the 2017 sexual assault allegation. Hegseth told police the encounter was consensual and no charges were filed.\n\nBut Kaine focused on the fact that Hegseth was married at the time of the incident, and had just fathered a child with a woman who was not his wife. \"I am shocked that you would sit here and say you're completely cleared,\" he told Hegseth.\n\n\"If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be Secretary of Defense, wouldn't it?\" Kaine said.\n\nHegseth responded that he was falsely accused.\n\nAsked if he was physically violent towards any of his wives, Hegseth said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nSenator takes on 'woke' military\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, disparaged what he referred to as the Biden “woke” military and what he called the false narrative that the military ranks were filled with extremists.\n\nHegseth called the military one of the least racist institutions in America.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth would carry out Trump military orders\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono asked Hegseth if he would comply with orders from President-elect Trump to deploy the military against protesters on U.S. soil and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nHirono referred to the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 when, according to an account by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Trump asked the army to shoot protesters during unrest in Washington, D.C.\n\nHegseth responded that he saw police injured by protesters, who he called destructive.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth denies sexual assault\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked Hegseth if he had sexually assaulted or harassed women.\n\n“No, senator,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth has made a disturbing pattern of making disparaging comments about women and minorities and walked them back, Hirono said.\n\n“You are no longer on Fox and Friends, Mr. Hegseth,\" she said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWould Hegseth carry out order to invade Greenland?\n\nHirono asked Hegseth if he would carry out an order to take over Greenland or the Panama Canal, a proposal floated by President-elect Trump with increasing conviction in recent weeks.\n\n\"Senator, I will emphasize that President Trump received 77 million votes in the election,\" Hegseth said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHirono asks if Hegseth will resign if he drinks on the job\n\nHegseth told Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, he was \"falsely accused\" when a woman reported him to police over an alleged sexual assault in 2017.\n\nHirono noted Hegseth had paid the woman a confidential settlement.\n\nThe two sparred when Hirono asked Hegseth about his alleged history of heavy drinking.\n\n\"Will you resign as Secretary of Defense if you drink on the job?\" she said.\n\nHegseth did not answer directly, saying he is committed to serve.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth says 'women will have access' to combat roles\n\nSen. Ernst said it’s “incredibly important” for men and women to be allowed to serve as long as they meet standards. “I do believe in high standards,” Ernst said.\n\n“Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles” if they meet standards, Hegseth said. Those units include infantry, artillery and armor.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Ernst, key Republican vote, has the microphone\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, an Iraq veteran and a survivor of military sexual assault, and one of three Republican senators seen as crucial to the survival of Hegseth's nomination, now has the floor. She's opened by asking about balancing the books at the Pentagon and reducing waste before moving to the question of women in the military.\n\nHegseth told Ernst he would prioritize an audit for the Pentagon, the only agency in Washington that has not passed one.\n\n\"Previous secretaries of defense, with all due respect, haven't necessarily emphasized the strategic prerogative of an audit,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBlumenthal asks if Hegseth will submit to a thorough FBI check\n\nBlumenthal challenged Hegseth to submit to a thorough FBI investigation that included allegations of sexual assault and interviews with his former wives.\n\nHegseth demurred, saying he was not in charge of FBI background checks.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBlumenthal questions Hegseth's financial management\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., questioned Hegseth on financial mismanagement at the two veterans organizations he headed, Concerned Veterans for America and Veterans for Freedom, which Blumenthal called \"the only test\" of Hegseth's ability to manage the military's $850 billion budget.\n\n\"Every dollar we raised was used intentionally for the execution of our mission,\" Hegseth said.\n\nDonors had in effect ousted Hegseth from one of the organizations, Blumenthal said, for mismanagement.\n\nHegseth said he was “extremely proud” of the work that he and others had done there.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nGillibrand raps Hegseth quota claim\n\nIn the face of strident statements from Gillibrand, Hegseth maintained that infantry commanders had to meet quotas for women in their units.\n\n“That does not exist,” Gillibrand said.\n\nThere are no such quotas, a Defense official confirmed.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nSen. Gillibrand hits Hegseth's comments on women in the military\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand lambasted Hegseth for \"creating the impression\" that the military maintains quotas for women in service roles.\n\n\"I have never disparaged women serving in the military,\" Hegseth responded.\n\nBut Gillibrand chided Hegseth for his past comments, saying he had \"denigrated\" women and LGBTQ people in the military.\n\n\"You said in your statement you don't want politics. Everything you've said in these public statements is politics,\" she said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nCotton asks Hegseth if he is a 'Christian Zionist'\n\nAsked by Sen. Tom Cotton if he considered himself a \"Christian Zionist,\" as protesters in the chamber had called him, Hegseth said he was a Christian.\n\nHegseth said Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza and that he supports Israel \"destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nShaheen presses Hegseth on women in the military\n\nSen. Jean Shaheen, D-N.H., asks Hegseth to answer for his comments on women war fighters, citing, among many statements, a chapter in his new book called “The (deadly) obsession with women warriors.”\n\nShaheen asked Hegseth if he thought the two women on the committee who served in the military, Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, were \"less effective and less capable,\" using his own words against him.\n\nHegseth said he was \"incredibly grateful\" for their service, but added, \"it's about standards.\"\n\nHegseth describes \"amazing contributions\" by women in the military.\n\nI appreciate your eleventh hour conversion,\" Shaheen said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth is asked about his efforts to clear fighters convicted of war crimes\n\nReed questioned Hegseth about his advocacy for the exoneration of several servicemembers convicted of war crimes.\n\n\"How will you be able to effectively lead a military in which one of the principle elements is discipline, respect for lawful authority?\"\n\nIn his response, Hegseth called U.S. rules of engagement \"restrictive\" and said they \"made it more difficult to defeat our enemies.\"\n\nHegseth came to prominence in part due to his advocacy on behalf of troops accused of war crimes.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pardoned Maj. Matthew Golsteyn and reversed the demotion for Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.\n\nGolsteyn, a Green Beret, was charged with executing a suspected bomb maker who had been ordered to be released after questioning in Afghanistan in 2010.

Reed said were sent to military officials threatening their positions and pensions for following military policies during the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\nThe emails, Reed said, called the officials \"disloyal, corrupt, traitorous, liberal,\" and he said their language echoed some of Hegseth's own writing and statements.\n\nAsked if he supported those letters, Hegseth pivoted to what he called a lack of accountability for the disastrous 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHegseth rails against media 'smear campaign'\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., offered Hegseth an opportunity to address allegations of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nHegseth blamed a “coordinated smear campaign in the media,” Hegseth said.\n\nIn particular, he singled out “left-wing” media for, he said, not presenting his side of the story.\n\n“All they were out to do was to destroy me,” Hegseth said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nHegseth calls himself 'a change agent'\n\nAddressing senators about to judge his qualifications to lead the Pentagon, Hegseth stressed his record in the military. \"I joined the military because I loved my country,\" he said.\n\n\"When I took off uniform, my mission never stopped.\"\n\nTo his lack of experience, Hegseth said, \"We've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives, and where has it gotten us?\"\n\n\"It's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm,\" he said, calling himself \"a change agent.\"\n\nHegseth began his statement by thanking his wife, Jennifer, whom he said had changed his life, his parents and seven children. He also credited his faith in God.\n\nHe praised President-elect Donald Trump, who he said charged him with bringing back a “warrior culture” to the Pentagon.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook and Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nProtesters removed during Hegseth statement\n\nProtesters have interrupted Hegseth's opening statement with a series of outbursts.

Please don't get into the cynical notion that people can't change.\"\n\nRep. Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman and Trump's pick for National Security Advisor, called Hegseth a \"dear friend\" and said he was prepared to revamp a Pentagon that he said \"continuously failed\" at its mission.\n\n\"I have no doubt that he is going to get the Pentagon back to his primary mission - lethal readiness,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a man who can reinvigorate that warrior ethos.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\n'You lack the character' to lead, Reed tells Hegseth\n\nReed criticized Hegseth for statements he’s made about diversity at the Pentagon. Hegseth has said that “Diversity is not our strength.”\n\nReed, who served in the Army in the 1970s, said the military was not stronger when women were prohibited from combat, and the Pentagon banned gay and lesbian people from serving.\n\n“Our military is more diverse than it has ever been, but more importantly, it is more lethal it has ever been,” Reed said. “This is not a coincidence. Mr. Hegseth, I hope you will explain why you believe such diversity is making the military weak, and how you propose to ‘undo’ that without undermining military leadership and harming readiness, recruitment, and retention.”\n\nReed noted that he has supported nine previous nominees for Defense secretary, but says he cannot vote in favor of Hegseth.\n\nRunning though a litany of allegations against Hegseth, including that he mismanaged two non-profit veterans' organizations, Reed winds up his statement: \"Unfortunately, you lack the character and composure to hold the position of secretary of Defense.\"\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTop Democrat registers opposition to Pete Hegseth\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat, makes clear his opposition to Hegseth in his opening statement, before the former TV host has heard a single question.\n\nReed listed the challenges facing the Pentagon: confronting China and Russia, dealing with turmoil in the Middle East, the threat of violent extremism. The next Defense secretary will need experience, wisdom and character, Reed said.\n\n“Mr. Hegseth, I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job,” Reed said.\n\nReed went on to question Hegseth’s alleged incidents of sexual assault and harassment, alcohol abuse, mismanagement of the non-profit veterans’ organizations he led, criticism of women in combat and championing the causes of troops convicted of war crimes.\n\n“I have reviewed many of these allegations and find them extremely alarming,” Reed said.\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nWicker praises Hegseth as unconventional but 'excellent' pick\n\nIn his opening statement, Sen. Roger Wicker, the Armed Services Committee's Republican chair, called Hegseth an \"excellent choice\" because of, not in spite of, his unconventional background.\n\nHe compared Hegseth's inexperience to Trump, \"that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that Mr. Hegseth, supported by a team of experienced top officials, will get the job done,\" he said.\n\nWicker described Hegseth as the right nominee to shake up a Pentagon \"no longer prepared for great power competition\" at a precarious global moment.\n\nOf Hegseth's past, Wicker said Hegseth had \"admitted to falling short, as we all do from time to time.\"\n\n\"It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the accusations leveled at Mr. Hegseth have come from anonymous sources,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nRep.

Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking member and former chair.\n\nHe asks the audience to stay quiet and avoid disruptions.\n\nSenate prepares to question Hegseth\n\nThe brightly-lit Senate hearing room was buzzing with activity Tuesday morning as senators prepared to publicly question Hegseth.\n\nCommittee and media personnel streamed past the velvet barriers separating the audience from a semicircle of senators' desks.\n\nA line of Hegseth supporters wearing matching baseball caps and red pins reading \"Vets for Hegseth\" filled a full row.\n\nTwo protesters with antiwar group Code Pink held signs up at the front, one reading, \"No Hegseth, No Christian Jihad,\" before a guard ordered them not to hold the signs above their heads.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat questions does Pete Hegseth face?\n\nSenators on the Armed Services Committee are looking for answers from Hegseth on how he would manage the military's $850 billion budget and its 2 million servicemembers. Also on the table are how Hegseth would approach ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and increasing tension with China.\n\nHegseth, a 44-year-old former Fox News host and veteran, could face tough questions about his personal life and past, including his reported history of heavy drinking, his treatment of women and a sexual assault allegation filed against him eight years ago. Hegseth has denied abusing alcohol on the job and says a disputed 2017 sexual encounter was consensual.\n\nSenators' sights are also trained on Hegseth's past comments opposing women serving in combat roles, which he walked back in the run-up to the hearing. A cultural critic of the military, Hegseth has accused the Pentagon of relaxing its personnel and training standards and adopting so-called \"woke\" ideology.\n\nDoes Hegseth have the votes for confirmation?\n\nHegseth needs a majority – 51 votes – to be confirmed in the Senate. With Republicans in the majority, he would win confirmation if every Republican voted for him.\n\nBut the Republican majority is slight, leaving Hegseth room to lose just three Republican votes. And some Republican senators have said they need to see more before they can cast a vote for him.\n\nThey include three women senators – Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa. To Ernst, a veteran and sexual assault survivor, Hegseth's past comments and history have personal significance.\n\n2017 sexual assault allegation hangs over Hegseth hearing\n\nSince Hegseth's appointment in November, a murky sexual assault allegation filed in 2017 has dogged his attempts to win over senators.\n\nA staffer for California Federation of Republican Women filed a police report that year after she said he assaulted her at a hotel conference. No charges were filed.\n\nHegseth later paid the woman an undisclosed amount to settle a potential civil lawsuit, in a settlement that included a confidentiality clause barring her from talking about the incident, according to his attorney, Timothy Parlatore.\n\nHegseth said he was \"buzzed\" but not drunk at the time, and that the encounter was consensual. But Parlatore told news sources in the last few months that Hegseth was \"visibly intoxicated\" and the woman was \"the aggressor.\"\n\nWhat time is the Pete Hegseth hearing?\n\nHegseth's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee is set to begin on 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 14.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/world/shark-week-facts-scn/index.html", "title": "Facts about sharks that may surprise you | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSharks have scared us a lot this summer, primarily for suspected attacks on humans. However, humans are a larger threat to sharks than sharks are to us.\n\nThe 35th official Shark Week takes place from July 23 to July 29 on the Discovery Channel and aims to increase conversation and education about these ancient marine predators that are key to the health of the ocean. (Discovery Channel and CNN share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThere are more than 500 species of shark. They are as diverse as the dwarf lantern shark, which is smaller than a human hand, and the whale shark, which can grow as long as a school bus, said marine biologist Michael Heithaus, professor and dean of the College of Arts, Sciences & Education at Florida International University in Miami. Given that there are a large number of unique species, some characteristics may be true for one species, but not another.\n\nSharks have been around for hundreds of millions of years, and while they continue to evolve, they are also in grave danger. Largely due to overfishing, shark and ray populations fell by 71.1% between 1970 and 2018, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Nature.\n\nSharks can live for hundreds of years\n\nSharks have one of the longest life spans compared with other animals.\n\nThe Greenland shark is the longest-living known vertebrate on Earth, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Science. Researchers using radiocarbon dating determined that the North Atlantic species likely lives an average of at least 272 years, and often doesn’t reach maturity until 150 years of age.\n\nGreenland sharks can live for at least 400 years, scientists have estimated.\n\nSharks are older than trees and dinosaurs\n\nThe earliest evidence of shark fossils dates back as far as 450 million years, which means these creatures have been around at least 90 million years before trees and 190 million years before dinosaurs.\n\nSharks have been around since before Pangea broke apart, said Catherine Macdonald, director of Field School and lecturer at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science. (There was one single gigantic continent called Pangea some 250 million years ago.)\n\nAdditionally, sharks have survived five mass extinctions, one of which wiped out around 96% of all marine life.\n\nSharks may be helpful for our environment\n\nTiger sharks, one of Australia’s primary predators, may help ecosystems respond to extreme climate events. The species’ prey, including green turtles, seabirds and stingrays, avoid shallow water, often areas with seagrass. As a result, the seagrass is able to grow to be bushlike and create a safe-haven nursery area for juvenile fish, shrimp and crabs, Heithaus said.\n\nA tiger shark glides along in Beqa Lagoon in the Fiji Islands. Media Drum World/Zuma\n\nSeagrass absorbs the carbon that is in the atmosphere and uses it to build its body. When the seagrass dies, the dead material gets buried in sediment on the ocean floor, and the carbon is taken out of circulation, Heithaus added.\n\nResearchers are currently trying to determine whether other shark species play a role in this phenomenon and whether it occurs in other places such as coral reefs.\n\n“It seems like it’s more than just tiger sharks,” Heithaus said. “It’s probably these bigger species that play an outsized role in helping shape the ecosystems they’re a part of.”\n\nShark pregnancies can last longer than 3 years\n\nReproduction patterns in sharks vary.\n\nOn average, sharks give birth after 11 or 12 months of pregnancy, but some sharks, such as the frilled shark and basking shark can be pregnant for over three years.\n\nSome sharks, like mako sharks and bull sharks, give live birth, while other sharks, like cat sharks, lay eggs, said Jasmin Graham, president and CEO of Minorities in Shark Sciences, based in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nLong pregnancy terms, and the fact that some sharks take 10 to 12 years to reach sexual maturity, like the great white, further impact populations decimated by unsustainable fishing practices.\n\nSharks do not vocalize\n\nSharks are primarily silent creatures, as they don’t have organs for producing sound.\n\nInstead of speaking, sharks communicate through body language, such as zigzagging, shaking and moving their jaws.\n\nSharks can sense electricity\n\nSharks have a sixth sense — they can pick up nanoscopic electromagnetic currents. This extra sense can help them navigate the ocean and find prey, or even a mate.\n\n“The minute electrical impulse that a prey’s brain sends to its heart to tell it to beat is detectable to sharks, so they can find hidden prey quite effectively,” Macdonald said.\n\nWith this finely attuned sense, sharks hunt sick and weak animals, playing a crucial role in keeping the marine ecosystem healthy.", "authors": ["Rachel Fadem"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/politics/jan-6-committee-final-report/index.html", "title": "January 6 committee releases final report, says Trump should be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection recommends barring former President Donald Trump from holding office again.\n\nThe recommendation is among the conclusions of the panel’s final report, a comprehensive overview of the bipartisan panel’s findings on how Trump and his allies sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, released late Thursday evening.\n\nThe 845-page report – based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation – includes allegations that Trump “oversaw” the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives” despite concerns among his lawyers that doing so could be unlawful.\n\nIn a symbolic move Monday, the committee in its last public meeting referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” the report states.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department’s investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.\n\nTrump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the “highly partisan” report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report:\n\nTrump and his inner circle engaged in ‘at least 200’ attempts to pressure state officials\n\nIn an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in “at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,” between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.\n\nTrump “spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,” the report says. (He lost all of those states.)\n\nFor example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a “litany of false election-fraud claims” and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by “finding” just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.\n\nTrump infamously said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.”\n\nCommittee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot\n\nThe January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nConservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot.\n\n“The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,” the report says.\n\nIt was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee’s conclusion about his leadership role is new.\n\nThe effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020.\n\nThe committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a “‘President of the Senate’ strategy,” which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro – an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor – was central to the creation of the plan,” the report says. “Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan’s foundation.”\n\nCNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded.\n\nTrump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo\n\nEastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory.\n\nEastman emailed Trump’s assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. “Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.”\n\nThe committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman’s phone records. Eastman’s two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure “President Trump is re-elected,” even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee.\n\nThese new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.\n\nThe committee obtained Eastman’s emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.\n\nTrump latched onto Eastman’s theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6.\n\nJanuary 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again\n\nBarring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.\n\nThe panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution” can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.\n\nIt calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a “formal mechanism” for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.\n\nSays lawyers should be held responsible\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.\n\n“Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report” the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having “conflicts of interests” for the Department of Justice to evaluate.\n\nThe report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.\n\nAlthough the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction “develop legislation” to create “a cause of action” for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.\n\nElectoral Count Act reform\n\nOne recommendation may soon become reality.\n\nThe panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power.\n\nThe House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation.\n\nCommittee refers Trump to Justice Department\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary first released Monday says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the report states.\n\nThe committee also revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” it adds, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nMillions of dollars were raised on false claims, but RNC showed caution to not go too far\n\nThe committee investigators describe how Trump campaign and Republican National Committee fundraising pitches containing false claims of a stolen election ultimately raised more than $250 million – but were met internally with some resistance.\n\nInvestigators describe three options that were considered for a post-election fundraising appeal by the campaign. One option, that the campaign opted against using because they knew it was false, said that Trump had won. A second unused option said the campaign was waiting on results. Ultimately, according to the committee, the Trump campaign approved a message that Democrats are going to “try to steal the election” that was written before election night.\n\nThe committee describes, based on interview with Trump campaign officials, that much of the material in the fundraising emails was based on messages said by Trump – but were not checked for accuracy before being used to ask for donations.\n\n“President Trump’s claims were treated as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked with ensuring accuracy,” the committee wrote.\n\nTrump campaign’s deputy director of communications and research Zach Parkinson told investigators that reviews for accuracy were limited to “questions concerning items such as time and location.”\n\nThe RNC did eventually tone down some messages, which the committee suggests shows “the RNC knew that President’s Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless” and made “changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure,” according to investigators.\n\nHouse investigators said that RNC lawyers directed copywriters not to use the term “rigged,” according to interviews conducted by the committee. The panel obtained several examples of fundraising appeals that were toned down to be accurate and less inflammatory.\n\nTrump privately called some of Sidney Powell’s election claims ‘crazy’\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks told the January 6 committee that Donald Trump had laughed at one of his election lawyer’s claims about foreign powers interfering in the election, calling them “crazy,” according to the committee’s final report.\n\n“The day after the press conference, President Trump spoke by phone with Sidney Powell from the Oval Office. During the call, Powell repeated the same claims of foreign interference in the election she had made at the press conference,” the report said, referring to conspiratorial claims made by Powell, Trump’s onetime attorney, at an outlandish press conference after the 2020 election.\n\n“While she was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?’” the report says.\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell falsely claimed, among other things, that widely used voting machines from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems featured software created “at the direction” of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros.\n\n“A few days later, the Trump campaign issued a statement claiming Powell was not part of the Trump campaign’s legal team. But Powell’s outlandish claims were no different from those President Trump was making himself,” the committee writes.\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nPro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing?

In an official statement on August 7, the airline announced its new \"preflight weighing\" procedure, explaining that the change was in the name of safety.\n\nUzbekistan isn't the only airline to take the view that all pounds are equal on board and incorporate passengers' weight into the equation. In 2013 Samoa Air made headlines around the world for introducing a particularly unconventional ticketing system: pay-as-you-weigh, and the airline touts its method of charging as the\"fairest system for payment of carriage of anything by air,\" which is interesting for a country that has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world.\n\nWeight is an especially touchy subject when it comes to flying, and between expanding waistlines and shrinking airplane seats there's been some serious friction, and airlines have been changing policies to address the concerns about overweight passengers since as early as 2008. Today, most U.S. airlines have some verbiage in their policies requiring passengers who are unable to fit in one airplane seat to purchase another one. And judging from related news it seems it's almost always messy when enforced or followed.\n\nIn 2013, around the time when Samoa Air introduced its policy there was some rumbling about other airlines potentially introducing a \"fat tax.\" But so far it seems like airlines will keep having overweight passengers buy extra seats instead. Policies regarding overweight passengers are not the only ones that have been considered discriminatory.\n\nGender discrimination: Another controversial area of airline policy has had to do with gender rules — and it's created some unexpectedly uncomfortable situations. Back in 2012, reports surfaced that airlines including British Airways and Qantas were forbidding men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors on flights. While separating men from children may have been intended to prevent child molestation, many claim the practice is unfair and discriminatory. British Airways rescinded it's policy after a famous court case in 2010 when a passenger accused the airline of sex discrimination.\n\n#SurnameGate: In what was cast as another discriminatory policy, Air Canada was accused of not recognizing married couples with different last names when a Canadian author put the airline on blast after being unable to transfer a ticket to his wife, who uses her maiden name. The incident was known the world wide web around as #SurnameGate. Eventually Air Canada changed its policy on voucher transfers for flight credits as well as gift cards to have no name restrictions, an Air Canada spokesperson confirmed.\n\nSkin color: When all is said and done, gate agents have the power to decide who gets on the plane and who does not. It all comes down to the judgment and intuition of whoever is on duty that day and for that flight. Recently, one incident got a lot of press when a redheaded Scottish teenager denied boarding because she was too pale to fly.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/18/akron-canton-airport-dedicated-1946-but-not-without-controversy/8467276002/", "title": "Akron-Canton Airport was dedicated in 1946, but not without ...", "text": "Akron didn’t want the airport to be built. Canton didn’t want Akron’s name to be first. Alliance didn’t want to lose out to Massillon.\n\nConsequently, the dedication of Akron-Canton Airport was a little tense 75 years ago. Nearly 35,000 people attended the ceremonies Oct. 12-13, 1946, at the 1,180-acre field in southern Summit County near the Stark County line.\n\nCommissioners in the two counties had worked together to develop the airport on a plateau in Green Township about 1,228 feet above sea level. The Civil Aeronautics Administration favored the site between Greensburg and Greentown because of its unobstructed views for pilots.\n\nAkron officials cried foul in February 1946 when American, Eastern, Capital and United airlines announced plans to leave Akron Municipal Airport in favor of a new field 16 miles away from the center of town.\n\n“A modern city without modern airplane facilities is like an inland town bypassed by steam roads,” fumed B.E. “Shorty” Fulton, manager of the city airport. “There are 1,200 municipal airports in the United States — and few of them have anything on Akron’s airport.”\n\nBut modern airplanes were getting bigger and federal authorities worried that the hilly terrain surrounding the municipal airport was a growing challenge for commercial pilots. Nearby landmarks such as the Akron Airdock, Rubber Bowl, Derby Downs and Guggenheim Institute hindered future expansion.\n\nName changes\n\nInitially proposed as Canton-Akron Memorial Airport, a tribute to veterans of World War I and II, the aviation hub swapped the order of the cities in a 5-1 vote by commissioners of both counties. Six months before the dedication, commissioners changed the name to Akron-Canton-Massillon Airport, which brought new tensions.\n\nCanton officials were miffed at playing second fiddle to Akron. Alliance officials were angry that their city’s name wasn’t included. Commissioners shortened the title to Akron-Canton, annoying Massillon. It was too late to change the federal abbreviation of CAK.\n\nIn an effort to soothe ruffled feathers, commissioners ordered all airport literature to add the line: “Serving Akron, Canton, Massillon, Alliance, Barberton and Cuyahoga Falls.”\n\nAirport Manager H.E. Ramsey oversaw construction of three runways 5,600 feet long and 150 feet wide. At the October dedication, Ramsey invited motorists to drive their automobiles up and down the smooth surface. Can you imagine that today?\n\nThere were no interstates. Akron residents who wanted to attend the two-day celebration were instructed to take Canton Road south to Greentown and turn right.\n\nVisitors toured the hangars under construction and surveyed the site where an administration building was planned.\n\nThe Dawn Patrol arrived early Sunday with 137 planes of all shapes and sizes. Champion builder Paul White, 15, of Akron, demonstrated how to fly model planes. The American Legion held a flag-raising ceremony.\n\nNearly 50 U.S. Navy fighter planes, including Hellcats, Corsairs, Avengers and Grummans, entertained the crowd. Lt. F.B. Underman of Akron led a formation of 25 warplanes through maneuvers. They swooped so low that spectators ducked.\n\nMore than 16,000 people climbed the steps to inspect an American Airlines DC-4 Cargoliner. United, Central and Eastern brought DC-3 passenger planes, and Eastern flight attendants served lunch.\n\n“This magnificent field is another landmark in the progress of Ohio,” Gov. Frank Lausche told the crowd. “It indicates the will of the people in these communities to keep abreast of the times.”\n\nCommissioners Ralph Kibler of Summit County and Oliver Kuhn of Stark County formally accepted the airport from Earl Heist of the Civil Aeronautics Administration.\n\n“This is a keystone of a system of airports such as has been needed for a long time,” Heist announced. “I can officially say it is one of the best airports in the country.”\n\nGeneral delivers warning\n\nAir Force Gen. Curtis LeMay, who had served in the Pacific during World War II, gave the keynote address, and frankly, it was a little scary. Instead of extolling the virtues of the airport, the battle-hardened general issued a warning about future attacks on the country.\n\n“No longer will the factors of space and time save America as they have in previous wars,” LeMay told the crowd. “America’s resources are still adequate, her industrial capacity still good. But atomic power and the development of long-range bombing planes have made even this Midwest airport as vulnerable as a seacoast airfield.\n\n“Next time we would be the first nation instead of the last to be attacked and the industrial sections would come first.”\n\nAfter praising President Harry Truman’s oversight of the military, LeMay expressed hope that the nation would build more airplanes.\n\n“Even if we have to fight to obliteration, we must have something to fight with,” he said.\n\nDid he know he was already standing on a battleground?\n\nAkron Mayor Charles E. Slusser pledged to “continue our fight to keep the service for Akron and to protect its interests and those of its industries.” He complained that the new airport was 16 to 20 miles away from the customers who would contribute 90% of its business.\n\nAkron-Canton Airport installed runway lights, completed hangars and constructed a temporary administration building and control tower. While private planes began to use the $2.5 million airport, commercial flights were delayed for nearly two years.\n\nAirlines demand transfer\n\nThe four airlines teamed up to force the issue, releasing statements in February 1948 that called for the transfer of service to the regional airport.\n\n“The advantage of moving to the new airport is definitely one of safety,” Eastern Airlines official Jack Hollywood said. “Safety has been our one consideration in the matter all along.”\n\n“With the longer runways at the new airport and better operational facilities, including an instrument landing system, we expect now to be able to maintain a higher degree of performance on our ships,” American Airlines official Frank Griffin said.\n\n“It will mean faster service to all points on our line,” Capital Air Lines official James Forb said.\n\n“We propose to open service as soon as we move — 30 to 60 days — with new four-engined aircraft,” United Air Lines official L.G. Wood said. “We can eliminate stops from here to New York and Chicago.”\n\nOn March 9, 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Board dismissed Akron’s complaint and allowed the airlines to transfer to Akron-Canton Airport.\n\nIn its report, the board noted: “It is unfortunate that the early development of airport facilities frequently resulted in the establishment of airports at locations unsatisfactory for development to meet the needs of present day airline operation. That was what has occurred here.\n\n“Although the authorization of the proposed transfer would seem to penalize a pioneer, the present and growing needs of the public are controlling and the proposed transfer must be approved.”\n\nDisappointed in ruling\n\nAkron officials expressed disappointment in the decision. More than 300 jobs would transfer from the city.\n\n“This is the biggest blow the city of Akron has suffered in its long flight to give Akron adequate air service,” Service Director Marvin L. Davis said. “It means that we will lose, almost completely, our identity in the aviation field.”\n\nAirport Manager Shorty Fulton added: “This move will definitely take Akron off the airline map of the United States. It will cost Akron users of airline transportation millions and millions in paying for extra transportation, inconvenience and time lost.”\n\nThe new airport went into commercial operation July 1, 1948. A United cargo plane with a load of pretzels left for Chicago at 2 a.m. At 7:45 a.m., T.H. Carroll of Akron was the first passenger to step aboard the first passenger plane, a United DC-3.\n\nA month later, Capital and Eastern joined United and American at the airport.\n\nA new terminal rises\n\nGround was broken on an eight-story terminal in September 1959. The $3.2 million, 77,837-square-foot complex would include a restaurant, coffee shop, cocktail lounge, newsstand, barbershop, covered walkways, conveyor system and a moving sidewalk between the first-floor ticket counters and second-floor waiting room.\n\nThe terminal went into limited operation Oct. 31, 1961. More than 150,000 people attended the three-day dedication celebration June 22-25, 1962. U.S. Rep. Frank T. Bow of Canton and U.S. Rep. William H. Ayres of Akron helped cut the ceremonial ribbon.\n\nIn the crowd were Akron dignitaries touting the progress of “our airport.” After Interstate 77 connected Akron with Canton in 1962, the place no longer seemed so far away.\n\nAkron-Canton Airport has expanded repeatedly over the past 60 years. The complex, which now takes up 2,700 acres in Green, has been renovated, redesigned and reconfigured. Airlines have come and gone, but the airport still promises “a relaxing customer experience and affordable fares.”\n\nAfter years of rivalry, Akron and Canton eventually met in the middle. There’s nothing like an airport to bring two cities together.\n\nMark J.

The excess flight noise has seriously dampened that amenity, he said.\n\n\"Since 2014 it has been an issue where obviously, when we're outside on the non-120 degree days, you've got a regular influx of planes flying directly over your house or within a block or two of your house and that noise is clear, and it's evident, and it disturbs the reason that many of these people bought into these neighborhoods,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWest Valley residents angry over Sky Harbor flight paths\n\nPhoenix leaders blast FAA", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/11/30/phoenix-faa-have-plan-resolve-sky-harbor-flight-path-controversy/909263001/", "title": "Phoenix, FAA have plan to resolve Sky Harbor flight-path controversy", "text": "Phoenix, historic neighborhood groups and the Federal Aviation Administration have reached an agreement to undo controversial flight paths implemented at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in 2014.\n\nThe joint announcement issued Thursday comes three months after the U.S. Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the FAA's approval of the new flight paths violated numerous federal laws.\n\nThe FAA changed the flight paths in September 2014 as part of the national NextGen program aimed at improving safety and efficiency.\n\nPhoenix and a coalition of historic neighborhoods sued the FAA in 2015, alleging the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it implemented flight paths that increased air traffic over some city parks and neighborhoods by 300 percent.\n\nThe court ordered the FAA to cancel the new routes and revert to the old ones.

Nor are they designed to put you in harm’s way.”\n\nInstead, he said, the changes \"aim to strike a balance between the concerns of the community and the need for us to conduct traffic stops for both safety and investigative reasons.\"\n\nAndrew Wolfson: 502-582-7189; awolfson@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @adwolfson.

That's a reversal of a March 2024 change to withhold only 10% of a recipient's benefits in event of an overpayment to reduce \"financial hardship on people with overpayments,\" the agency said at the time.\n\nThat change came after the SSA faced criticism in 2023 – and disparaging media coverage from KFF Health News and Cox Media Group Television Stations and \"60 Minutes\" – about how it went about collecting overpayments, some of which happened more than a decade ago.\n\nIn some cases, people lost their homes as benefits were cut off to make up an overpayment. \"Innocent people can be badly hurt,\" then-Social Security chief Martin O'Malley said, according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNow, the administration is reinstating the previous overpayment recovery strategy. That means as of March 27, any Social Security overpayments found will result in withholding of 100% of the recipient's benefits until the overpayment is made up, the agency said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe withholding rate will not change for those beneficiaries currently reimbursing an overpayment, the agency said. Also, the withholding rate for overpayments of Supplemental Security Income benefits will remain at 10%.\n\nThe change comes as President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, have sought to cut federal spending. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is planning reduce its workforce by more than 12%, cutting 7,000 employees, it announced on Friday.\n\nAs for the Social Security program, Trump has promised not to cut benefits. \"Social Security won't be touched, other than if there's fraud or something. It's going to be strengthened. But it won't be touched,\" he told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Feb. 18.\n\n'Vampires' in Social Security data?: Here's what to know after Elon Musk claims SSA fraud\n\nSocial Security: Fraud and overpayments\n\nTrump and Musk have alleged widespread fraud in the Social Security program. During his speech to Congress on March 3, Trump mentioned \"probable fraud,\" with millions of benefit recipients over the age of 100 in the system.\n\nBut those claims are contradicted by a 2023 report from the nonpartisan inspector general for the Social Security Administration, which found about 18.9 million 100-plus aged people without death information in the agency's records, but none were getting benefits.\n\nLess than 1% of payments are improper and most are overpayments, found a July 2024 report from Social Security’s inspector general.\n\nThe agency is required to get back those overpayments, said Lee Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, in the notice posted on the agency website. “We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people,” he wrote. “It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds.”\n\nThe change is expected to result in overpayment recoveries of about $7 billion in the next decade, according to The Office of the Chief Actuary, the agency said.\n\nWhat is a Social Security overpayment?\n\nSocial Security pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year to about 70 million people monthly. An overpayment involves a beneficiary getting more money than they should have gotten.\n\n\"Overpayments happen for several reasons, such as a beneficiary neglecting to update their income, marital status or work situation, or the SSA miscalculating how much it should pay,\" advises finance site NerdWallet. \"Regardless of who is at fault, beneficiaries who receive overpayments from the Social Security Administration usually have to give back the money. Because taxpayer money funds Social Security benefits, the SSA is legally required to recover overpayments.\"\n\nDuring fiscal years 2015 to 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, but made $71.8 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, according to the July 2024 inspector general's report.\n\nAnother report by the agency's inspector general, issued in 2022, found that 73,000 overpayments were the fault of the SSA due to lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"\n\nIf the agency determines a beneficiary has been overpaid, it will send them an overpayment notice.\n\nIf Social Security overpaid you, how do you pay it back?\n\nAny beneficiary found to have been overpaid will \"automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" according to Friday's notice. That means benefits will be docked until the overpayment amount is met.\n\n\"If someone cannot afford full recovery of their overpayment, they can contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 or their local office to request a lower rate of recovery,\" the agency said in the notice.\n\nThe SSA typically begins withholding from benefits about 60 days after notifying beneficiaries about the overpayment.\n\nYou can repay the overpayment by credit card, online bill pay or check.

You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nWith 61% of the contiguous US in drought, wouldn’t it be nice if we could just “make it rain” or just “make more snow?”\n\nWell, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It’s called cloud seeding, and it’s nothing new.\n\nIt’s been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons (most notably China), but it’s a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West.\n\nIt’s also surrounded with controversy.\n\nWe spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for Wyoming’s Weather Modification Program, who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing.\n\nGondzar said some people say “you’re playing God,” others say “you are stealing moisture from the storm,” making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nThere are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold.\n\n“Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,” is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, “in a nutshell.”\n\nWyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 as part of a study. Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works.\n\nThis season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming.\n\nKing Air's twin engine plane that is used for cloud seeding. Weather Modification International 2022\n\nShe pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down.\n\nWhen you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the ’70s and ‘80s, the state is fairly new to the game.\n\nCloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze).\n\nClouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky.\n\nThe nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise.\n\nIt’s done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent.\n\n“The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,” Gondzar explained. “But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.” It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you’ll completely miss your target.\n\nThe most popular way is by plane, using flares. “There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,” Gondzar pointed out.\n\nThis photo shows flares fixed on the aircraft's wing that house the silver iodide used for cloud seeding. Weather Modification International 2022\n\nOnce the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and “seed” the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation.\n\nThe silver iodide “is a natural salt compound,” Gondzar emphasized. “The reason it’s used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don’t have that, you’re not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.”\n\nBut if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again.\n\nIs it working?\n\n“Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,” Gondzar said. “You can’t break a drought with cloud seeding. It’s a tool in the toolbox.”\n\nGondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it’s difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting.\n\n“There’s evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,” Gondzar noted. “The question that they’re trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that’s a difficult question to answer. Because there’s an abstract piece of this. There’s really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.”\n\nShe knows cloud seeding doesn’t generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days.\n\nAccording to Wyoming’s Water Systems Data Map, some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down.\n\nSince most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term.\n\n“It’s a small incremental change over a long period of time. That’s why consistency is important,” Gondzar urged.\n\nShe added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap.\n\n“Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.”\n\nBut you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can’t just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain.\n\n“This is not something that we can do out of thin air,” Gondzar cautioned. “The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.”\n\nIt can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range.\n\n“The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,” Gondzar said. “But you can’t just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.”\n\nShe explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed.\n\n“A lot of people think it’s manipulating the weather pattern,” Gondzar remarked. “We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.”\n\nShe is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific.\n\n“There’s always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.”\n\nPlaying God\n\nWhile Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn’t steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree.\n\nDaniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer Rachel Ramirez.\n\nHe told her “It is possible that you’re actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it’s even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.”\n\nHe went on to ask, “To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?”\n\nHe believes water equity issues need to be researched more.\n\nAnother note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim.\n\nShe pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver.\n\n“There’s silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,” Gondzar noted. “So you already have a natural background level of silver, it’s been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.”\n\nShe said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she’s hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road.\n\nThere have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here’s more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding’s climate angle.\n\nClimate scientists remain skeptical this is the silver bullet\n\nAlthough cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology’s efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather.\n\nSwain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are.\n\n“How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?” Swain told CNN. “This isn’t a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.”\n\nCloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways.\n\nThat’s what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. Their results, published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger.\n\nDuring the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall.\n\nIn three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified “unambiguous seeding patterns,” in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds.\n\nDespite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding — up to 10% — isn’t enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West.\n\n“It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,” she said. “That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It’s not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager’s toolbox.”\n\nWhen it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology.\n\n“I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,” she contended. “So it’s to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.”\n\n“But that does not mean that there isn’t room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,” Tessendorf added.\n\nWith the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts.\n\n“There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,” Swain asserted. “The best case scenario is it’s a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that’s not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray Rachel Ramirez", "Jennifer Gray", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2013/04/17/customs-dispute/2090861/", "title": "Deal near for controversial customs office in Abu Dhabi", "text": "Bart Jansen, USA TODAY\n\nCustoms operates similar overseas checkpoints in Canada%2C the Caribbean and Ireland\n\nOverseas checkpoints are designed to heighten security%2C reduce customs lines in the U.S.\n\nCustoms lines at U.S. airports have been growing since federal budget cuts took effect last month\n\nWASHINGTON — The federal government is nearing completion of an agreement to open a Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Abu Dhabi, despite strong opposition from U.S. airlines and their pilots.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has reached an agreement with the United Arab Emirates on how to operate the checkpoint and what facilities will be required at Abu Dhabi International Airport.\n\nBut those negotiators and the State Department are still discussing additional issues before the checkpoint will open.

The changes are part of a plan to increase airline capacity in Montgomery toward pre-pandemic levels. The airport reported Delta started the month with bigger aircraft making the airline’s four daily flights between Montgomery and Atlanta, meaning more seats for passengers. Capacity will increase again May 1 when Delta starts allowing middle-seat passengers for the first time this year. One pandemic change that’s not going away is Delta’s new cleaning and sanitation procedures. The airline has announced that they’ll become permanent. Federal guidelines require air travelers to continue wearing masks. American Airlines resumed nonstop flights between Montgomery and Washington, D.C., earlier this month. The airport also offers nonstop flights to Charlotte, North Carolina, and to Dallas.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has announced that Alaska will conduct a national advertising campaign to support its tourism industry. The Republican governor also reiterated in a Friday news conference his assertion that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should allow a cruise season. “This is an economic death grapple right now with individuals that are focused on health,” Dunleavy said. Another hurdle is a federal law that requires cruise ships that enter Alaska to stop in Canada, which will not allow stops this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, KTOO Public Media reports. Dunleavy has signed a resolution asking Congress and President Joe Biden to exempt Alaska from the law. Democratic state Sen. Jesse Kiehl sponsored the measure. He said the cruise season can happen despite the pandemic. “The simple fact is that this is a live-or-die moment for the economy of a huge portion of our state,” Kiehl said. Dunleavy’s office said tourism businesses will soon receive relief grants. The governor said details of the aid plan will be announced this week.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: HonorHealth unveiled a sculpture Friday intended to recognize health care workers combating COVID-19, but the hospital removed the piece Saturday following criticism that the work was offensive to Asians because of its depiction of a Chinese dragon to symbolize the pandemic’s origins. The sculpture, created by HonorHealth staffer Vincent Russo, depicts a dragon wrapped around a masked health care worker carrying a sphere or orb. Controversy surrounding the sculpture was first reported by Justin Lum of Fox 10, who on Saturday received confirmation from an HonorHealth spokesperson that the sculpture was no longer being displayed after “the symbol of the Chinese dragon was interpreted negatively among our Asian community.” The company apologized and said it removed its social media posts about the sculpture, according to its statement to Lum, who is vice president of the Arizona chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association. “As a proud Asian American, I can’t interpret the meaning of the statue any other way,” he said. Russo addressed the controversy on Facebook, saying that there was no intent to “hurt or diminish others” and that he began planning for the sculpture a year ago before an attack in Atlanta made violence against Asian Americans a prominent subject in the news.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Mercy Fort Smith celebrated a milestone this month when it administered its 20,000th dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Kevin Goff, 20, of Booneville received the hospital’s 20,000th dose during his scheduled appointment April 2. Goff wanted to get the vaccine to protect himself and those he encounters at his job at Walmart in Booneville. “I got it mainly so I don’t get COVID, and I don’t spread it to others. Especially with where I work, I’m with customers a lot,” he said. Arkansas has expanded vaccine eligibility to include anyone 16 or older. The Mercy Fort Smith vaccine clinic now has online scheduling available; those registering can select their date and time when they sign up for the vaccine. Mercy has worked through its earlier vaccine registration lists. Anyone who thought they were registered but hasn’t been contacted can now schedule one of these online appointments. To schedule, go to mercy.net/fsmvaccine, or call (833) 364-6777.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city has opened up vaccines to younger people, days ahead of the state broadening eligibility to everyone 16 and up. An option to book vaccine appointments for residents 16 and older at city-run inoculation sites appeared on the registration website starting Saturday, the LA Times reports. “We are excited to open vaccination appointments for Angelenos 16 and older,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement. “We continue to receive a limited supply of vaccines, and when we receive greater supply in the weeks ahead, the city will be ready to administer even more vaccines quickly and safely.” The expansion of vaccine eligibility in Los Angeles follows similar moves by the Southern California counties of Riverside and San Bernardino, Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Fresno County in the central valley. People 16 and up can get the Pfizer vaccine, while the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are for people 18 and older. However, California public health officials warned Thursday of decreases in supply because of a national reduction of the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in coming weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: About 3,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been confiscated from a medical spa after El Paso County health officials observed problems in vaccine storage Friday, prompting the state health department to investigate the vaccination process there. The state health department announced Friday night that it suspended vaccinations at Dr. Moma Health and Wellness Clinic because of those observations earlier in the day and said investigators were working to determine if what was seen was isolated. A spokesperson for the county health department, Jared Verner, told The Gazette that 150 syringes of vaccine will have to be destroyed because the state cannot verify proper handling and temperatures were maintained at the clinic, which had been administering the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The fate of the remaining 3,000 doses confiscated by the Colorado National Guard will depend on the results of the state’s investigation, he said. According to its website, the clinic offers mostly aesthetic services such as facials, acne treatment and tattoo removal and is led by Sylvienash Moma, who holds a doctorate of nursing degree. More than 1,000 vaccination appointments at the site were canceled Saturday in addition to another 6,000 scheduled through May 8, the state health department said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: High school proms and graduation ceremonies can take place this spring but should have precautions to reduce the possibility of spreading the coronavirus, the state’s Department of Public Health said. Attendees should wear masks and practice social distancing regardless of their vaccination status, the department said Friday as it issued a series of guidelines. Events also should be held outdoors with a scheduled rain date, rather than moving indoors. Schools holding indoor events should consider reducing capacity, health officials said. Also, delaying events until later in the school year or after it ends will give more students the opportunity to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The state recommended schools set up mass testing sites and require attendees to show proof of a negative test for the virus result within 72 hours of the event. Schools also should consider not serving food and drinks to reduce the amount of time people have to take off their masks, the state said. Event planners “will also have to consider the potential downstream consequences of hosting or attending large events with limited control over the movement and interactions among attendees, which could include quarantining an entire class of students if a single case of COVID-19 is present at an event,” the state said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After getting shelved last year – and doused with a heavy rain the year prior – Winterthur Museum is poised to hit the ground running with its Point-to-Point steeplechase May30. This annual horse race is on pace to be one of the first major Delaware events of the year. The Division of Public Health approved Winterthur’s COVID-19 plan, allowing up to 3,600 guests for the event next month. This pandemic rendition of Point-to-Point will include pod seating for up to 10 tailgating guests per tent, race director Jill Abbott said. All attendees are required to bring masks and wear them wherever they can’t maintain a safe distance of 6 feet from others outside their group or household. Holders of lifetime rights have until Thursday to purchase their spaces. It costs $500 to become a lifetime holder. The remaining spaces will be offered to the general public Friday. A small number of exclusive tailgate tents are available for purchase by the general public. For more information, call (302) 888-4994, or contact point-to-point@winterthur.org.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Another technical glitch for D.C.’s unemployment claims website has left thousands of people waiting weeks for benefits, WUSA-TV reports. Website problems have cropped up several times during the pandemic. Unemployment benefits have been a lifeline for people out of work amid economic shutdowns. “I’ve been unemployed for a year now waiting for everything to get back to normal,” said bartender Liz Danko, one of the thousands of D.C. workers forced to rely on unemployment benefits during the pandemic. The latest website update hit Danko in mid-March. “Then all of a sudden, I’m like, ‘Where’s my employment this week?’ ” she said. “The website says it is $0, paid out.” Four weeks later, after countless hours on the phone and numerous emails, she still has no benefits and no solution from the city on how to get them. “The thing is, we have a system I always say that was coded ... when Elvis had No. 1 hits,” D.C. Councilwoman Elissa Silverman said. She said she hopes all the issues the district’s unemployment system has caused will be a wake-up call to her fellow council members and the mayor. She said the city is building a completely new unemployment claims website, but it won’t be ready until 2022.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked YouTube and its parent company, Google, on Monday, accusing the tech giant of censorship for its decision last week to remove from its platform video of a coronavirus discussion he organized where his panel criticized lockdowns and some mask-wearing as ineffective. DeSantis said YouTube’s contention that video of the March 18 panel violates its ban on the posting of disinformation is an attempt to stifle dissent against the federal government’s pandemic response. That discussion included Dr. Scott Atlas, a radiologist who was a coronavirus adviser to former President Donald Trump, and other physicians who support DeSantis’ decision to open Florida’s economy with few restrictions. Monday’s attack is part of a bigger war DeSantis and other Republicans are waging against social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, contending they discriminate against conservatives. During a Tallahassee press conference with Atlas and other doctors who were on his earlier panel, DeSantis said YouTube was working “in service of the ruling elite.” YouTube says it took down the DeSantis panel video because some participants said children should not wear masks because they are ineffective at that age and a possible health hazard. YouTube said that contradicts U.S. government guidelines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTiger: The Tiger Drive-In, one of only five drive-in theaters left in the state, was able to open for its summer season in April 2020 when all indoor cinemas remained closed amid the pandemic and proved a hit with residents of the small Rabun County town of Tiger and surrounding areas. While box office numbers across the globe took a nosedive last year, “we had our best year ever,” owner-operator Tom Major said, “and we did it without Hollywood.” Some of the most heavily advertised, hotly anticipated big studio releases for 2020 saw repeated delays and cancellations due to theater closures. Though films like “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Tenet” would’ve drawn even bigger crowds to venues like the Tiger, Major said classic titles like “Grease” and “Dirty Dancing” still sold out every night. Even when local multiplexes began reopening at limited capacity later in the year, the Tiger offered more to its patrons than a regular theater ever could. From livestreamed concerts featuring acts like Blake Shelton and Metallica to performances by local bands and even a Democratic Party of Georgia event, the site transformed itself into a cultural hub for the community. “There was a dance studio in Clarksville that couldn’t hold its indoor recitals, so they filmed them, and we showed them on our big screen,” Majors said.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui County will soon require second coronavirus tests for trans-Pacific travelers flying directly to the island. In addition to the current state-required pre-travel tests, people flying into Maui County from outside Hawaii will now be required to get negative virus tests when arriving at the Kahului Airport to avoid quarantine, Mayor Michael Victorino told reporters Wednesday. People who refuse either test will be required to quarantine for 10 days on Maui. The pre-travel tests must occur at most 72 hours before passengers take their flights. “This secondary test has been designed to determine if visitors and returning residents are contributing to the large rate of COVID-19 here in Maui,” Victorino said. He estimated the program may take up to 10 business days to put in place. A study conducted in November by Maui health officials found that 2 out of every 281 travelers who consented to second, follow-up coronavirus tests at the airport tested positive, the Maui News reports. A county spokesperson could not be reached for comment Wednesday by the Maui News regarding how much the new testing program will cost.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy was arrested twice in two hours Thursday on suspicion of trespassing at the Statehouse. Police said he returned to the Capitol building shortly after bailing out of jail on the first arrest. It wasn’t immediately known why Bundy was at the Statehouse, but it marked the fourth and fifth times the man known for leading a 2016 armed standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge has been arrested in Boise since August, with all but one occurring at the Statehouse. Bundy has been banned from the government building since August after he and dozens of others – many of them members of his People’s Rights organization – staged a series of protests at the Statehouse over coronavirus-related measures. In one of the protests, angry, unmasked protesters forced their way into a House gallery with limited seating, shattering a glass door in the process. Video taken by an onlooker during the first of Bundy’s two arrests Thursday shows Idaho State Police officers lifting him from a wheeled cart and placing him a police car. Bundy repeatedly asks the officers, “By what authority are you arresting me?” Idaho State Police spokeswoman Lynn Hightower said officers used the wheeled cart, which looks somewhat like an oversized jogging stroller, because Bundy refused to leave the building under his own power.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: To make COVID-19 shots more available and combat vaccine hesitancy, Hospital Sisters Health System began to give doses without an appointment Monday at HSHS Medical Group’s drive-thru clinic in the parking lot of Scheels. The site will inoculate people 16 and older with Pfizer’s vaccine from 10 a.m. to noon and from 1 to 4 p.m. every day through Friday, said Tammy Lett, the medical group’s vice president of operations. HSHS decided to offer “walk-in” availability of vaccine at the system’s Springfield site because of increasing supplies of vaccine and waning demand for appointments made online, she said. Lett, a registered nurse, said she is “very concerned” about rising number of COVID-19 cases statewide. Making vaccines even more convenient to obtain could help stem the resurgence, she said. “We’re trying to get out as much information as we can,” Lett said. “The vaccine is safe. Come get it.” Public health officials have said fatigue among the public to wear masks and social distance, combined with more easily transmissible and potentially more deadly coronavirus variants, are contributing to the resurgence of cases in Illinois and across the country, almost exclusively in the unvaccinated population. Lett cited a “false sense of security” among some that they are protected as others get vaccinated.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Hospitality workers who supported the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, from stadiums to hotels to restaurants, were first left off COVID-19 vaccine priority lists and then largely left out of the rigorous March Madness safety plans. Many were exposed to large crowds, sometimes maskless, during the weeks businesses swelled with visitors. As the tournament ended, the city’s most famous restaurant – a popular tourist spot – announced it was temporarily closing after nine employees contracted COVID-19. Then on April 3, his 45th birthday, its longtime bartender Michael Gaines died. After the news of the outbreak and death at St. Elmo, The District Tap co-owner Michael Cranfill recalled that he and other people in the industry had lobbied for vaccine prioritization. “I think there could have been different policies and prioritization in place,” he said. “Hindsight 2020, but this was something that was brought up and discussed.” Despite the hospitality industry lobbying Gov. Eric Holcomb for priority in vaccinations, the state took largely an age-based approach that frustrated many workers who deal directly with customers. “The first thing people wanted to do is to go out and use the service industry again,” said lighting technician Jay Higginson, who works at a nightclub.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Another person associated with the state Senate has tested positive for the coronavirus, staff reported Monday morning. The person tested positive Saturday and was last in the Capitol building Wednesday, according to an email from Senate Secretary Charles Smithson. The notification did not identify the person who tested positive, but it was the second reported case associated with the Senate this legislative session. Senate staff reported the first case March 29. There have been seven reported cases associated with the Iowa House of Representatives. Legislative leaders have routinely not identified those who have tested positive with the virus. Safety protocols that Republican leaders have put in place do not require disclosure of cases, although leaders have encouraged it.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Blue Valley school district by a Johnson County commissioner who was denied entry into a district meeting because she refused to wear a mask. Johnson County District Judge Robert Wonnell ruled Friday that Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara had no standing to file the lawsuit under a state law passed last month that details how people can object to COVID-19 restrictions. O’Hara said she has a medical condition that exempts her from wearing a mask, and she was told unless she could show proof of the exemption, she could not attend a Tuesday hearing on the mask mandate, The Kansas City Star reports. In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Blue Valley officials argued O’Hara was not harmed by the district’s enforcement of the mask rule. The hearing was postponed after another person refused to wear a mask, and it was held virtually Wednesday. The district also argued O’Hara doesn’t have standing to challenge the law because she is not an employee, student, parent or guardian of district student. She does have grandchildren in the district. District officials announced Thursday that Blue Valley will keep its mask requirement until the end of the school year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear vowed Monday to lift capacity restrictions at most venues and businesses once 2.5million Kentuckians have received at least their first COVID-19 shot, offering an incentive to accelerate the vaccination pace. The Democratic governor’s announcement coincided with the opening of the state’s largest vaccination site at Cardinal Stadium in Louisville. The goal is to vaccine 200,000 people in the next seven weeks at the massive drive-thru location, he said. More than 1.5 million Kentuckians have received at least their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, but Beshear has stressed recently that many sites have available openings. He’s hoping the new the vaccination goal for ending capacity restrictions at most businesses and venues will offer an enticement to pick up the pace. That threshold could be reached in as little as 31/ 2 weeks given current vaccine supplies, but “realistically” it’s probably going to take four to six weeks to achieve it, he said. “But it is all up to us,” the governor said. “Every single individual’s choices can get us closer to that normalcy we’ve been looking for.” Meeting his “vaccination challenge” also would result in removing physical distancing restrictions as well as curfew restrictions on bars and restaurants. A mask mandate would remain.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has opened a vaccine hotline to help people schedule appointments and connect those reluctant about getting the shot to medical professionals who can answer questions. The hotline at 1-855-453-0774 is part of the Louisiana health department’s outreach work to bolster COVID-19 vaccination rates in a state that exceeds many of its Southern neighbors but lags much of the nation. Hotline hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 8 p.m. Sunday. The call center aims to assist those who have been unable to navigate online scheduling systems for vaccine doses because they don’t have internet access or aren’t tech-savvy. But the health department also sees it as a way to provide science-based information about the vaccines to those who may be on the fence because of worries about safety. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the state is shifting some workers it hired to do contact tracing to staff the vaccine hotline instead. The contact tracing work has never produced as much robust information as state officials had hoped. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will open its first Louisiana mass vaccination site next Friday in Baton Rouge, capable of administering up to 3,000 shots a day, President Joe Biden’s administration announced Friday.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Organizers of the Portland Pops July 4th celebration said the event is canceled again this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The city, Shamrock Sports & Entertainment, and the Portland Symphony Orchestra issued a joint statement Friday saying the event has been canceled “in order to ensure the health and safety of the community.” The organizers said they’re hopeful for next year. “We are excited to explore the possibility of continuing this beloved tradition in 2022,” the statement said. The statement also said the city is considering the possibility of still holding a fireworks display. The event and fireworks were both canceled last year. Meanwhile, schools in one of the state’s largest school districts are going remote this week because illness is preventing bus drivers from working. Lewiston school Superintendent Jake Langlais said in a Sunday letter to parents that the transportation staff is dealing with three cases of the coronavirus and two other medical situations. “I know this impacts each and every family,” the letter said. “However, if we cannot transport our students we need to be remote.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Statewide disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations expose barriers that underserved populations face in avoiding life-threatening infection. Maryland’s early vaccination rollout shows a pattern of racial disparity mostly among Black and Latino residents. Health care disparities hold a firm grip on communities of color in the state, a reality that has only worsened with the pandemic. According to state data, an average of 62% of vaccine doses have gone to white residents, with only 21% going to Black Marylanders. In Prince George’s County, Latino residents make up 20% of the population, but only 5.7% have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the county’s vaccine dashboard. As of April 6, Black people in Baltimore City have received 28.5% of the total vaccinations administered, despite accounting for 62% of Baltimore’s population. “We need to see decisions and structures put in place for those with the greatest need for the vaccine because they are the ones that are getting sicker,” said Dana Moore, Baltimore City’s first chief equity officer. Health officials say they are working toward prioritizing vaccines for minority residents, but so far the data has not shown significant changes.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The College of the Holy Cross has restricted all in-person activities, including varsity sports, until at least Wednesday in response to dozens of new coronavirus cases on campus. Contact tracing shows that of at least 40 new cases, most are linked to outdoor gatherings of students during warmer weather and Easter break travel, the Jesuit school said Friday. Classes will be held remotely, the library is closed, and Sunday Mass was livestreamed. Students who live off campus will not be allowed on, except for virus testing, visits to health services and picking up food from the dining hall. Students who violate the restrictions face “serious consequences,” the school said. “We’ve noticed more close contacts converting to positive cases than earlier in the year. More students who test positive are also reporting more serious symptoms than in the past,” the school said. The college, with about 3,000 students, will reevaluate restrictions Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday outlined her priorities for spending billions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid, saying the focus should be on long-lasting initiatives to help small businesses, support job growth and upgrade neglected infrastructure. Other priorities include additional public health and mental health funding, expanded access to preschool and child care, and programs to address pandemic-related learning loss. The Democratic governor said the $18 billion-plus coming to Michigan as part of a $1.9 trillion rescue package is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity.” About $5.7 billion is for state government, $4.4 billion is for municipalities, and $3.9 billion is for K-12 schools. Both Whitmer and the Republican-led Legislature will need to agree before much of the funding is disbursed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Rising commodity prices, good weather and two rounds of government aid in 2020 led the state’s farmers to their most profitable year in nearly a decade. A report from the University of Minnesota Extension and the Minnesota State Agricultural Centers of Excellence pegs median farm net income at nearly $107,000 last year following seven years of low profitability. By contrast, from 2013 to 2019, the state’s median annual farm profit hovered between $27,000 and $42,700. Economists say 2020 provided “a sigh of relief,” though they are measured their assessment because of the volatility of farming, the Star Tribune reports. Without government aid, Minnesota farmers would have experienced an eighth straight year of low profitability, said Pauline Van Nurden of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Farm Financial Management. “Farms did have a successful year last year – a profitable year – given all of the challenges of the pandemic,” Van Nurden said. “It was the first year in eight years that they’ve really seen strong profits. It’s been a pretty long downturn up until now.” Government support played a key role in farm profits last year, accounting for 12% of gross farm income for the average producer.\n\nMississippi\n\nRaymond: Hinds Community College is offering free classes this summer, using federal coronavirus relief money to cover the costs of tuition, fees and books. Registration opened Monday for new students at the central Mississippi college. Classes begin June 1. The college said in a news release that people can earn up to 12 hours of credit through the free in-person or online courses. The classes are available to current Hinds students, dual enrolled students, high school graduates, transfers from other colleges and university students who want to take summer courses at Hinds. Information is available at hindscc.edu/summer.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A “mega vaccine event” mounted at the campus of Missouri State University on Thursday and Friday didn’t meet its stated goal of vaccinating 10,000 people, despite the fact that Gov. Mike Parson said earlier in the week that the event would welcome walk-ins with no online registration needed. Even so, turnout broke a single-day state record for vaccinating people against COVID-19, according to a Springfield-Greene County Health Department news release issued early Friday evening. The health department said that over the two-day event, 6,131 Missourians were vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose shot. On Friday, 4,385 doses were administered, breaking a single-day record of 3,999 doses set earlier by St. Charles County. The health department said Springfield’s mega event was “the largest one-dose vaccination event in the state of Missouri to date.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The last time the Legislature directed money to college students who need it most, it set aside $2 million, and private foundations matched the amount for a $4 million total over the 2021 biennium. This time, various proposals for need-based aid have come and gone for smaller amounts, but the most recent federal coronavirus aid package directs a whole lot more to campuses – $38million over two years – said Tyler Trevor, deputy commissioner for budget and planning in the Montana Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education. “So we’re doing really good in financial aid world,” Trevor said of the money universities are getting from the American Rescue Plan Act. Part of the idea is that students who had to drop out of college because of the pandemic can get some assistance going back. Trevor said campuses have to use half of their recovery money toward “emergency aid,” which has similar criteria to Pell Grants. Pell Grants go to students who demonstrate financial need. In Montana, they account for some 37.5% of the Montana University System enrollment, but they’ve made up as much as 47%, Trevor said. The money isn’t limited to being used on tuition. It can cover room and board or a laptop for a student who suddenly has to take courses online.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Residents who have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies in the past three months are no longer required to quarantine if they get exposed to the virus again, but they’ll still have to wear a mask in public, state officials said Monday. Officials plan to update the state’s public health requirements this week to match new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Felicia Quintana-Zinn, an administrator with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Previously, people who were exposed to the virus were required by the state’s health directives to self-isolate for at least 14 days. “If you have a positive test result that shows you’ve got the antibodies, and you’ve been exposed, then you don’t have to quarantine like you normally would,” Gov. Pete Ricketts said at a news conference. “But you still have to wear a mask in public.” About 29% of Nebraska residents 16 and older have been fully vaccinated, according to the state’s online tracking portal. As of Monday, there were 168 people hospitalized with the virus in the state, a figure that has risen in recent weeks but is substantially lower than the record highs of mid-November, when nearly 1,000 were hospitalized. The state has confirmed 214,351 cases and 2,221 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new expo center has opened downtown, marking a first step toward recovery after conventions and trade shows came to a halt last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A new $103.5 million Expo at World Market Center opened Friday ahead of five days of market show dates this week at the sprawling facility near the Spaghetti Bowl interchange on Interstate 15. The twice-a-year trade show draws thousands of home and gift industry professionals to Las Vegas to see new designs in furniture, bedding, lighting, flooring and home decor. The three-year project is an investment by Blackstone, International Market Center parent company. At 315,000 square feet, the Expo was designed as a gateway between the temporary market exhibits and permanent showrooms on the 5 million-square-foot World Market Center Las Vegas campus. Company CEO Bob Maricich noted that the trade show is the first in Las Vegas since conferences and conventions were shuttered in March 2020 to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A federal appeals court has vacated a judge’s ruling that upheld the state House speaker’s refusal to provide remote access to legislative sessions to lawmakers at a higher risk of serious complications from COVID-19. Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Sherman Packard, a Republican, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions and that it forced them to either risk their lives or abandon their duties as elected officials. A federal judge ruled against them, saying the House could proceed with in-person sessions. But the Boston-based 1st Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday sent the case back to the judge in Concord with instructions to hold further proceedings to determine if the plaintiffs are “persons with disabilities within the meaning” of the ADA or the federal Rehabilitation Act. The court also ruled that the Concord judge “should also determine whether – and to what extent – changing circumstances may moot the plaintiffs’ claims,” as vaccines become more available. House Democratic Leader Renny Cushing said the decision was “a great victory for democracy,” WMUR-TV reports. “It sends a clear message the Legislature is not above the constitution and ADA.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The coronavirus outbreak sent profits plunging at Atlantic City’s casinos by more than 80% last year, according to figures released Friday by state gambling regulators. But despite those dismal numbers, seven of the nine casinos still managed to eke out a profit, no matter how small, in 2020. The state Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the nine casinos collectively posted $117.5 million in gross operating profits in 2020. That was down from nearly $594 million a year earlier, before the pandemic forced casinos to close for 31/ 2 months and limited their operations even after reopening. Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry. “Atlantic City and its casinos endured their most challenging year in history,” said James Plousis, chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Even after being allowed to reopen in July, the casinos’ earnings were limited by travel restrictions, limited amenities and canceled entertainment, he said. “Yet, through responsible management, the casinos proved that in-person gaming could happen safely,” Plousis said. “As tourists return to the shore, they can have every confidence Atlantic City is safe for the summer.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a $7.4 billion general fund spending plan for the coming fiscal year that boosts state funding for public education, early childhood services and more – while using her veto pen Friday to assert sole authority over $1.6 billion in new federal pandemic relief funding. General fund spending will increase by 5% during the fiscal year that starts July 1, with more than one-third of the increase directed toward education. The governor vetoed the Legislature’s recommendations for spending more than $1 billion in federal relief on initiatives that avoid future payroll tax increases on businesses, underwrite college tuition for in-state students, backfill lost income at state museums and more. New Mexico’s $1.6 billion share of financial relief approved by President Joe Biden and Congress dwarfs that state’s incremental annual increases in spending on state agencies and education. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said that the state is waiting on instructions from the U.S. Treasury Department on how relief funds may be used and that the executive branch of state government has full authority to assign the money. That clashes with legal interpretations from leading legislators.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Some 51,000 more New York City students will return to in-person schooling later this month, bringing the total number of students in school buildings to 365,000 out of 960,000 non-charter public school students, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. “We have just over 50,000 students who have opted in for in-person learning again across all grade levels,” the Democratic mayor said at a virtual news briefing. “They are all welcome back.” Parents whose children were attending school remotely were given a two-week window ending last Friday for opting back in to classroom learning. De Blasio said he was not surprised that the majority of families choose to stick with remote schooling. “My view is, a lot of parents were really focused on the scheduling question,” the mayor said. “They had gotten into a schedule that worked for them with remote. The kids had gotten used to and like the teachers they had. And they didn’t want to disrupt that. I think that’s where most parents were at.” De Blasio said some parents may still choose online learning next fall, but he expects that “the vast majority of parents are going to want their kids in school five days a week.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: This year’s North Carolina Blueberry Festival has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting state restrictions on mass gatherings. “This decision is very difficult to make, but we do it to keep our vendors, volunteers and visitors safe,” Pete Cowan, the festival’s sponsorship chairman, said in a press release. “The Blueberry Festival Board has looked at this from all sides; and we cannot get around the fact that the festival attracts over 40,000 people and current state mandates on outdoor gatherings just won’t allow us to hold the festival.” The celebration, founded in 2003 as a way to celebrate the local blueberry harvest and Pender County tourism, is typically held on the third Saturday in June in Burgaw, with events that include the Tour de Blueberry bicycle race, a barbecue cook-off and a blueberry recipe contest. The festival was also canceled in 2020. To support local farmers, organizers said several have been invited to sell blueberries at the Burgaw Courthouse Square on June 19. The N.C. Blueberry Festival Association plans to hold other community events this fall that will include festival-themed activities, blueberry pancakes and other sweet treats. It will also participate in the Town of Burgaw Blueberry Drop on New Year’s Eve.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state reported 48 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the statewide total for active cases to 1,111. The average number of cases has been on the rise in recent weeks. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 20%, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 276,426 people – representing more than 36% of the state’s population – have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. About 26% of people have completed the vaccination process, according to the CDC. The state’s Department of Health did not report any new deaths Sunday, but four more people were hospitalized with the virus. A total of 35 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, but only three were in intensive care units. Over the course of the pandemic, 1,471 North Dakotans have died after contracting COVID-19.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state’s mask mandate remains in effect, officials clarified after confusion over a new order that replaced 18 others. Last week, Gov. Mike DeWine announced the state would simplify coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses, events and more. At the same time the revised order was issued, another order rescinded 18 others, including the state’s face mask order. People who only saw the latter might have thought that meant facial coverings and other mitigation measures, such as requiring space between tables at bars and restaurants, were no longer required. But the new, broader order stated in the second section that masks were still required in indoor spaces outside one’s home and other situations. Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud signed a revised health order Friday meant to clear things up. The revised order also includes new language that clarifies that tables at restaurants, bars and banquet facilities must be spaced 6 feet apart unless there is a physical barrier between them. DeWine has said all health orders, including the mask mandate, would be lifted when Ohio reaches a rate of 50 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents during a two-week period. That number was 183.7 on Thursday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A citywide mask mandate for the public is expected to end April 30, according to Mayor G.T. Bynum. “There has not been a spike in contagion resulting from spring break,” Bynum said Friday after meeting with Tulsa Health Department officials. “If these trends continue through the end of the month, the Health Department’s recommendation is that the city’s mask ordinance can expire as scheduled on April 30. I support this recommendation.” Bynum said private businesses are allowed to require masks, and restaurant and bar employees must continue wearing them. Events with more than 150 people must also meet spacing requirements, and events of more than 500 people must have a safety plan approved by health officials, Bynum said. Tulsa and Oklahoma City officials each approved mask mandates in July. The Oklahoma City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to allow its mandate to expire April 30 as well.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Demand for COVID-19 vaccines is leveling off in some counties, even as eligibility drastically expands. All Oregonians over age 16 will be eligible for a shot April 19. But officials expect by mid-May – well before the state achieves enough community immunity to stop the coronavirus’ spread – some areas will have more shots than people willing to get them. The Oregon Health Authority doesn’t track or estimate the number of people refusing shots overall or in certain categories, OHA spokeswoman Delia Hernandez said. But after weeks of eligibility for seniors, state data is beginning to reflect that vaccine hesitancy. In seven of the state’s less populous counties, less than half of those 65 and older have been vaccinated, OHA said. Asked why they might hesitate to get the shot, most residents’ responses fell into three broad categories: Some are concerned the vaccine was developed and approved too quickly, with unknown long-term side effects. Others say the vaccine is pointless if recipients still have to wear masks and socially distance and if immunity wears off quickly. And still others have a general distrust of government. Jennifer Benson, 66, of Damascus, said she was “unsure if we should be controlled to get the vaccine.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will expand vaccine eligibility to all adults beginning Tuesday, nearly a week ahead of schedule, as supply begins to catch up with demand and as officials try to keep pace with a mutating coronavirus. Vaccine providers told the Health Department they were having trouble filling appointments, signaling that it was time for the state to abandon its phased rollout and make COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone 16 and older, the acting health secretary, Alison Beam, said Monday. The quickened pace comes as Pennsylvania grapples with a spring surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “We need to maintain acceleration of the vaccine rollout, especially as case counts and hospitalization rates have increased,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement. Most states have already established universal eligibility ahead of an April 19 deadline set by President Joe Biden. Wolf had said last week that the state was taking a more gradual approach in hopes of avoiding the kind of bottleneck that occurred when Pennsylvania rapidly expanded vaccine eligibility to everyone 65 and older in January. The state has since improved its vaccine rollout. About 39% of the population has now received at least one dose, 11th among all states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Al Fresco on the Hill is returning to the city. The program to allow struggling restaurants on Federal Hill to set up tables on the street in a safe manner is scheduled to start May 14 and run for about 20 weeks through early October, Mayor Jorge Elorza said Friday. Under the program, a portion of Atwells Avenue will close to motor vehicles on Fridays and Saturdays from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Rick Simone of the Federal Hill Commerce Association said about 25 restaurants are planning on participating, but he expects that number to grow.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: An epic staffing shortage has unnerved area restaurant owners who fear the inability to meet customers’ expectations will jeopardize businesses they kept afloat throughout the pandemic, The Post and Courier reports. Restaurateurs are frantically paring down menus and abbreviating service hours in hopes of compensating for unfilled positions. For employees, though, there are no workarounds for the pent-up demand for dine-in meals colliding headlong into restaurants struggling to rebuild their staffs. Forced to deal with customers who didn’t use their pandemic year to acquire compassion, workers say they’re facing unprecedented stress that’s made them reconsider their decision to stick with the hospitality industry. Giselle Gaeta, who works at the Summerville location of Cuban Gypsy Pantry, said she and her colleagues are scrambling to cover a shortfall with the restaurant down five employees. But her best wasn’t enough for a recent customer who bypassed the pre-calculated tip choices on his check to leave a “custom tip” of 8% on a $57.88 bill. “Smile & be a little more polite,” he wrote, drawing a little happy face to show what he had in mind. Beyond the chaos that customers can see, Gaeta said patrons don’t appreciate the huge volume of to-go orders that restaurants are now processing.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Half of the population age 16 and over has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the state Department of Health announced Saturday. Health officials opened vaccine eligibility to anyone over 16 last Monday. Nearly 300,000 residents in total have received at least a single dose of the vaccine, and about 70% of those people have completed their vaccinations. “This milestone would not have been possible without the help of our healthcare professionals and all responsible South Dakotans who’ve chosen to be vaccinated,” Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said in a statement. “Vaccinations is the quickest way out of this pandemic.” However, Malsam-Rysdon warned that there has been a 75% jump in COVID-19 infections among people in their 20s over the past six weeks. The state has reported 2,413 people with active infections, including 238 new cases. There are 102 people in the hospital with COVID-19.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State labor officials are continuing to offer free online courses to help people without work during the pandemic advance their skills. The Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development said the Coursera Workforce Recovery Initiative will run through the end of 2021. The department said thousands of Tennesseans took advantage of the program last year. Coursera partners with 200 leading university and industry educators to offer thousands of courses across business, technology and data science that help prepare people with no degree or technology background for entry-level work in fields that include IT support, project management, UX design and data analytics. Tennesseans interested in the program can create an account on Jobs4TN.gov and email their name and phone number to coursera@jobs4tn.zendesk.com.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott said Texas is “very close” to reaching herd immunity against COVID-19, an assessment that runs counter to recent comments by health experts and his own medical adviser. Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Abbott touted the state’s relatively low coronavirus numbers. Roughly 19% of Texans are fully vaccinated. More than 70% of the state’s seniors have received a vaccine. More than 50% of Texans 50 to 65 years old have received a shot, Abbott said. “I don’t know what herd immunity is, but when you add it to the people who have acquired immunity, it looks like it could be very close to herd immunity,” he said. Estimates vary on what percentage of the population must be protected from the disease to reach herd immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has said the number could be as high as 85%. Abbott’s own medical adviser, Dr. John Zerwas, said this month that even if the goal is 70%, “we’ve got a ways to go.” He said the rising number of vaccinated Texans could be slowing the spread of the virus. Other health experts were less optimistic. Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the UT COVID-19 modeling consortium, attributed the drop in coronavirus numbers to changes in behaviors and policies at the local level.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A clothing store was forced to close for a day after employees said a man refused to wear a mask and then threatened to shoot everyone in the store. “I asked him to put a mask on, and immediately he just started to be really combative about the whole thing,” Stockist employee Josh Edgar told KSTU-TV. “After a couple of minutes, I got him out of the store. Meanwhile, he was still yelling at us and calling us names.” When the man was outside, he threatened to come back with a gun and shoot the place up, Edgar said. “My mind just went to Atlanta and Denver and everywhere else that there has been a mass shooting as of late,” Edgar said. Employees called the police, and owner Helen Wade closed the store for the day Sunday. A statewide mask mandate had expired Saturday, but Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall extended the city’s mask mandate. Businesses around the state are still able to mandate masks as they wish. The store reopened Monday without further incident. Still, Wade said she is concerned this type of behavior might occur again at her store. “I am definitely scared that we are going to see more of this,” she said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont is promising to “take strong and swift action” against students who violated the school’s COVID-19 safety restrictions at a Lake Champlain beach. Hundreds of young people flocked to Burlington’s North Beach to enjoy the summerlike weather Saturday. UVM Vice President Gary Derr said if UVM students at the beach weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, they could be subject to school discipline. At the beginning of the semester, the students agreed to follow Vermont’s COVID-19 guidelines. Derr said officials are examining videos of people at the beach. “We are going to be looking that over,” Derr said. “We are going to be looking at other information we might have, and if we can successfully identify individuals that were up there that were violating university policy, we will take strong and swift action on this.” The university reported nearly 100 new coronavirus cases last week. The total number of cases for the spring semester is now more than 500. “Our message to everybody is not who was there or who wasn’t there,” Derr said. “We all need to be safe. … Now is not the time to back down.”\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A federal grand jury has indicted four people for their roles in a scheme to use the identities of 35 state prison inmates to secure more than $300,000 in pandemic-related unemployment benefits, federal authorities said Friday. Two women worked with two inmates at correctional institutions to collect information of other inmates to apply for the unemployment benefits, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. The two men who were serving time were accused of providing information for inmates where they were incarcerated, according to the news release. The four people charged and the prisoners whose IDs were used shared about $335,000, prosecutors said. Although the conspirators initially obtained $436,834, the Virginia Employment Commission was able to reclaim some of that after discovering the fraud, according to the news release. Mary Benton, 38, of Portsmouth, and Angelica Cartwright-Powers, 35, of Norfolk, face multiple charges, as do inmates Michael Lee Lewis, Jr., 41, of Chesapeake, and Michael Anthony White, 38, also of Chesapeake. If convicted, the conspirators face a maximum of five years in prison on a conspiracy charge and 30 years in prison on each fraud charge.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Pacific Lutheran University will cut three dozen full-time positions to stabilize its budget after a months­long review by faculty of potential reductions. The cuts will eliminate majors in German and Nordic studies; minors in classical studies, German and Norwegian, and the Master of Science in finance degree, The News Tribune in Tacoma reports. “While difficult, this work is an essential step in our strategic plan, and will allow PLU to remain true to its mission,” President Allan Belton said in a statement. Course offerings won’t be affected until the 2022-23 academic year, and the university will work with students to complete their major or minor if they are already enrolled. The reductions affect departments across the university, according to Antonios Finitsis, an associate professor in the university’s religion department. Finitsis also served as chair of the Faculty Joint Commission, which was responsible for reviewing enrollment data, the demand for majors, minors, and graduate programs and the faculty needed to support them. “Even though it was painful, upsetting, anxiety-generating work, we did the absolute best we could,” Finitsis told The News Tribune. Belton told faculty last year that the university was facing declining enrollment, anticipated budget shortfalls and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday urged more residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and made a plea for residents to trust medical experts. The Republican said more than 75% of residents 65 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, but he has a goal of at least 85% coverage. The state opened up eligibility to all residents 16 and older last month. “We’re constantly looking for arms to put vaccines in,” Justice said at his coronavirus news briefing. More than 90% of total doses currently in the state have been administered. About 37% of West Virginia’s 1.78 million residents have received at least one vaccine dose, state data show. Nearly 26% are fully inoculated against the illness that has killed 2,745 people in the state so far. Justice addressed people who may be holding out on rolling up their sleeves: “You may be sitting there and thinking, ‘Well, now that there’s been a bunch of people to get vaccinated, I can slide by and just not get vaccinated.’ Oh, what a chance you’re taking.” He noted the danger of coronavirus variants that are more infectious and deadly. Monongalia County, home to West Virginia University in Morgantown, announced Monday that it has nearly 200 identified cases of variant strains. Officials said there are 164 cases of the California variant and 32 of the U.K. variant.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Almost all urban schools in the state taught their students virtually in December, compared with only a fraction of rural schools, according to a study released Monday. The Wisconsin Policy Forum released findings based on a state survey of Wisconsin schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program. About 4 of every 5 public and private schools responded to the survey, which found 80% to 90% of urban schools had all or mostly virtual instruction in December depending on the grade. That compares with 40% to 50% of suburban schools and 14% to 18% of rural schools. The Wisconsin Policy Forum noted that the data is ambiguous in some cases. For example, if a grade is marked as 40% virtual, that could mean either all students are virtual two days a week, or most students are attending class in person five days a week, but 40% chose an all-virtual option. Data for the early months of 2021 isn’t available yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers ended a monthlong legislative session without agreement on resolving a $300 million education funding shortfall. House and Senate members remained at odds late Wednesday on where cuts should occur, how to spend federal funds and whether to impose a 0.5% sales tax if state reserves fall below a certain level, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The legislative session, extended two days because of a blizzard that shut down the Capitol in March, ended with one of the session’s major items still on the table. The K-12 shortfall has been exacerbated by a coronavirus-related downturn in fossil-fuel markets that is straining Wyoming’s economy and state revenue. Lawmakers had agreed to a supplemental budget with $430 million in cuts, an unusually big revision for a general session. Legislators write the state’s two-year budget in even-numbered years and focus mainly on non-budget matters in odd-numbered years. Last year, state agency cuts imposed by Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, slashed 10% from the $3.3 billion, two-year budget he signed just months earlier. The cuts in this year’s supplemental budget bring the overall budget well below $3 billion. Now, Wyoming will keep burning through state savings to keep its school districts funded.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/media/top-gun-maverick-taiwan-flag-reinstated-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' brings back Taiwan flag after ...", "text": "Hong Kong/Taipei CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” is now showing Taiwan’s official flag after an outcry, putting its release in mainland China in jeopardy.\n\nThe box office mega-hit — which is by far Tom Cruise’s biggest-ever commercial debut — now features his character sporting the flag on his iconic bomber jacket, including in the version shown in Taiwan.\n\nInitially, the film’s trailer in 2019 had shown otherwise. During the preview, the patches on Cruise’s jacket, which originally bore flags that represent Taiwan and Japan, appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme.\n\nThat omission had angered some critics, prompting speculation that the change was made to appease Chinese censors and the film’s Chinese backer, Tencent (TCEHY). At the time, Tencent (TCEHY) Pictures, a subsidiary of the Shenzhen-based tech giant, was an investor of the highly anticipated sequel to the 1986 classic.\n\nNow, however, the company has pulled out. The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unidentified sources, that Tencent had relinquished its role as a financier of the film in late 2019, amid geopolitical concerns between China and the United States.\n\nThe firm was worried about falling out of line with officials in Beijing for promoting a movie that celebrated the American military as US-Chinese relations soured, according to the report. Tencent and Paramount (PGRE) Pictures, the studio behind the film, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA sensitive topic\n\nChina and Taiwan have a complex relationship. Beijing’s communist leadership has long claimed Taiwan, a self-governed democratic island, as part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it.\n\nAs part of its campaign, the Chinese government has pressured multinational companies to refer to Taiwan as a Chinese territory, in exchange for accessing its lucrative market.\n\nThe drive has been largely successful, with players like United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), Marriott (MAR), American Express (AXP), and Goldman Sachs (GS) falling in line. Hollywood films have also been increasingly censored over the years as China grew in importance to the global box office.\n\nChinese and Japanese relations have also long been fraught, with tensions flaring in recent years over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nIn the trailer of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" two jacket patches that had originally shown the Japanese and Taiwanese flags (left) appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme. @markmackinnon/TWITTER\n\nNow, the film’s update is likely to anger some fans and officials in mainland China.\n\n“There’s a high probability Beijing will ban the release and monetization of ‘Top Gun’ in China,” said Chris Fenton, former president of DMG Entertainment and author of the book “Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion-Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business.”\n\n“There’s also a probability the Chinese government will blackball the studio, filmmakers, and actors from the market for an extended period of time,” Fenton added. “We’ve witnessed similar punishments in the past.”\n\nSince 2020, China’s strict “zero Covid” restrictions have left many cinemas shuttered for extended periods of time, including in Shanghai and Beijing. That’s in sharp contrast with how moviegoers elsewhere have recently flocked back to theaters around the world.\n\nCurrently, “Top Gun: Maverick” has not been released in mainland China, and does not have a set opening date.\n\nBut Fenton noted “that may have been a forgone conclusion anyway,” given the heightened geopolitical tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“A film strongly promoting Western ideals and US military hegemony probably never stood a chance for approval,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that the Chinese film market has recently eschewed Hollywood movies in favor of other titles. In recent months, patriotic propaganda war movies have topped the box office domestically.\n\n“That’s a likely calculation that led to the decision [for producers to include Taiwan’s flag],” said Fenton. “The global goodwill generated by reinstating the flags easily outweighs any potential revenues from China.”\n\nThe move delighted fans in Taiwan: Social media users there cheered the decision online this week, with some calling it a “pleasant surprise.”\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick,” in which Cruise reprises his role as Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, has already smashed box office records, taking in more than $300 million worldwide, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the latest round of blockbusters, including “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” were still able to enjoy “massive international success” despite limitations from “some countries.”\n\n“Hollywood is starting to realize the aggravation of attempting to please China’s fickle and unpredictable censors is no longer worth the potential payoff,” said Fenton.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Wayne Chang", "Michelle Toh", "Wayne Chang"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nDespite numerous calls from astronomers to rename its powerful new telescope, NASA officials stood by the naming of the James Webb Space Telescope before its launch.\n\nWith the telescope nearly a year into its stint in space, the agency has released its chief historian’s investigation into the namesake of the telescope. James Webb, NASA’s second-ever administrator, worked at the US State Department during the Lavender Scare, a period in which LGBTQ federal employees were often fired or forced to resign, and the decision to name the telescope for him courted criticism from researchers.\n\nThere’s no evidence that proves Webb was directly involved in those firings in the 1950s or in the 1963 firing of gay NASA employee Clifford Norton, according to Brian Odom, the NASA historian who completed the investigation.\n\nWebb’s name caused controversy\n\nOfficials at NASA announced in 2002 that the telescope would be named for Webb, who oversaw the Apollo moon landing program in the 1960s and helped burnish the fledgling agency’s reputation. It was considered an unusual choice at the time, since Webb was an administrator and not a scientist.\n\nMonths before the telescope was set to finally launch, though, several astronomers called on NASA to remove Webb’s name from the telescope, which has since recorded several never-before-seen images of the universe.\n\nJames Webb (center) is flanked by Alabama Gov. George Wallace and Marshall Space Flight Center director Dr. Wernher von Braun in 1965. Webb has been praised for his role in the Apollo moon program. NASA\n\nIn a 2021 piece for Scientific American, a group of astronomers wrote that Webb’s legacy “at best is complicated and at worst reflects complicity in homophobic discrimination in the federal government.”\n\nEven scientists who work on the telescope have expressed their dissatisfaction with its name. Earlier this summer, Dr. Jane Rigby, the operations project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, tweeted that “a transformative telescope should have a name that stands for discovery and inclusion.”\n\nOfficials at NASA have refused to rename it, though, citing an investigation into Webb’s career. The results of that investigation weren’t made public until now, almost a year after the telescope launched.\n\nThe report found no evidence linking Webb to firings\n\nIn his report on his investigation into Webb, Odom acknowledged the pain caused by the Lavender Scare but said that “no available evidence directly links Webb to any actions or follow-up related to the firing of individuals for their sexual orientation.”\n\nThe findings of that investigation, Odom wrote, were based on more than 50,000 pages of historical documents from various archives, including NASA headquarters, the Truman Presidential Library and the National Archives.\n\nOdom investigated two meetings that predated Webb’s time at NASA: In 1950, then-undersecretary Webb met with President Harry S. Truman and later two White House aides and Democratic Sen. Clyde Hoey of North Carolina to discuss the Hoey Committee, a Senate subcommittee created to investigate how many LGBTQ people worked for the federal government and whether they were “security risks.”\n\nIn his meeting with Truman, Webb discussed with the president how the committee and the White House “might ‘work together on the homosexual investigation,’” according to historian David K. Johnson, author of “The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government,” one of the many documents Odom cites in his report.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful telescope ever built. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nNo evidence links Webb to any action that followed those discussions, Odom said.\n\nThe historian also investigated the firing of Norton, a budget analyst at the space agency. Norton sued the Civil Service Commission after his firing, and his case, Norton v. Macy, was one of several that helped overturn the executive order that allowed federal agencies to fire LGBTQ employees for their sexuality, Odom wrote.\n\nOdom said he found no evidence to show that Webb was aware of Norton’s firing; since it was federal policy at the time to oust LGBTQ employees, Odom wrote, Norton’s departure was “highly likely — though sadly — considered unexceptional.”\n\nNo documents could prove that Webb was directly linked to firings of LGBTQ employees, Odom said.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2021/10/01/2021-launches-halloween-liftoff-lucy-spacex-spacecraft-hubble-telescope-replacement/5912999001/", "title": "2021 launches: Halloween crew, Lucy spacecraft, Star Trek celeb flight", "text": "Want more stories like this sent directly to your email inbox?

Officials had been expecting 50-plus launches, but only 23 missions are in the books with three months left in the year.\n\nThe Space Coast, however, could still top 2020's total of 31 launches and several high-profile missions are still scheduled. Here's a look at some of them.\n\nOct. 12: Blue Origin/New Shepard\n\nIf everything pans out \"Star Trek's\" Captain James T. Kirk will boldly go where he has not gone before. Celebrity William Shatner is set to fly on privately owned Blue Origin's next crewed mission according to the launch provider.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOur beloved Captain Kirk and a crew of three other passengers will liftoff from Blue Origin's Launch Site One near Van Horn, Texas.\n\nThis launch will make Shatner, 90, the oldest person to travel to space.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket's 18th mission launch follows the company's first crewed mission which took Amazon founder Jeff Bezos into space. The NS-18 has a to-be-determined window on Tuesday, Oct. 12.\n\nOct. 16: NASA's Lucy spacecraft\n\nThe Space Coast's next launch is a big one for NASA.\n\nThe agency's Lucy probe, designed to study the asteroids of Jupiter, is slated to take flight on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket no earlier than Saturday, Oct. 16. Liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41 is currently set for 5:34 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLucy is a small probe with a big mission: Over the course of more than a decade, it will be responsible for becoming the first spacecraft to visit and gather data on the gas giant's rocky companions, also known as the Trojan asteroids. Scientists hope to glean knowledge about the state of the solar system as it was billions of years ago.\n\nUnlike many spacecraft, Lucy isn't an acronym – it's named after a roughly 3.2 million-year-old skeleton discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. During excavation, \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" by The Beatles played on repeat, giving archaeologists the idea to name the skeleton after the song.\n\nNaming the spacecraft, NASA said, pays tribute to its mission to study the solar system and how life began here.\n\nOct. 31: NASA / SpaceX Crew-3\n\nKayla Barron, Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Matthias Maurer are set to become the next team of astronauts launching from Florida.\n\nA SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket will boost the crew to the International Space Station no earlier than Oct. 31 during a yet-to-be-determined window, kicking off a \"long-duration stay\" aboard the laboratory. For reference, the previous Crew-1 and Crew-2 missions were scheduled to last about six months.\n\nCrew-3 marks the third fully operational crewed mission for SpaceX and fourth overall under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nKennedy Space Center's pad 39A will host liftoff and a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean will do the same for landing.\n\nDec. 4: NASA/SpaceX CRS-24\n\nSpaceX's next cargo-only launch to the ISS, meanwhile, is currently on the books for Dec. 4. A Cargo Dragon spacecraft will take flight from KSC with thousands of pounds of supplies, science experiments, and other hardware for the crew of the ISS and stay on-station for about a month before returning to Earth for splashdown.\n\nAs usual for SpaceX's cargo missions, pad 39A will host and the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will target a drone ship landing in the Atlantic.\n\nThis will mark SpaceX's 24th cargo flight for NASA's Commercial Resupply Services program.\n\nAn exact liftoff time has not yet been released.\n\nDec. 18: NASA's James Webb Space Telescope\n\nThough it's not launching from the Space Coast, this mission decades in the making will see NASA's newest space telescope launch from South America on a European rocket before the end of the year.\n\nIf schedules hold, the roughly $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope will fly to Earth orbit no earlier than Dec. 18 from French Guiana, an overseas territory of France in the northeast corner of the continent. Arianespace's heavy-lift Ariane 5 rocket will host.\n\nThe telescope, named after an early NASA administrator, is designed as a replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope and was originally scheduled to launch in 2010 at a cost of $1 billion. Despite the delay and cost overruns, scientists are excited about Webb, which is expected to represent a giant leap forward in astronomy.\n\nAt least part of the reason for flying on a European rocket is the partnerships in place that developed the telescope: More than a dozen countries were involved in the joint effort between NASA, the European Space Agency, and Canadian Space Agency.\n\nPlans to launch the telescope outfitted with the now-iconic 18 hexagonal mirror segments began in earnest in the late 1990s. Prime contractor Northrop Grumman built the telescope – slated to be the biggest, most powerful ever – at its facilities in California.\n\nThe exact launch window is not yet available.\n\nTBD: NASA's Space Launch System\n\nNo list of 2021 launches is complete without at least a mention of NASA's upcoming Space Launch System, a massive rocket designed for deep space missions to the moon and beyond.\n\nTeams in the Vehicle Assembly Building at KSC are working on prepping the rocket for an eventual rollout to pad 39B for its first launch of the Artemis program known as Artemis I, but NASA has not provided updated timelines. The agency was hoping to fly the uncrewed demonstration mission by November, but recent hardware milestones point to the launch likely delaying to December or early 2022.\n\nSLS will eventually be the rocket NASA uses to launch astronauts on Artemis III, which aims to put a man and woman on the lunar surface by 2024. Even the agency's own inspector general, however, sees that deadline as increasingly unlikely.\n\nLate February 2022: Axiom Mission 1\n\nJumping forward to the new year, one mission immediately stands out: Axiom Mission 1, or Ax-1, a private flight to the ISS slated for no earlier than Feb. 21.\n\nFormer space shuttle astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria will command the tourist flight that will include Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur; Mark Pathy, CEO of Canadian investment firm Mavrik; and Eytan Stibbe, a former Israeli Air Force fighter pilot and businessman involved in several industries.\n\nThe team of four is expected to spend about a week on the ISS after launching from KSC's pad 39A. Their Crew Dragon capsule will splash down off the coast of Florida, most likely in the Atlantic Ocean if weather conditions are favorable (the Gulf of Mexico is also an option).\n\nAxiom Space is one of several companies investing in the future of space tourism. Initially founded to build its own private space station, Axiom is currently working with customers on flights similar to Ax-1. Actor Tom Cruise was slated to join the mission in February, but decided to postpone to a later date.\n\nFor the latest, stay tuned at floridatoday.com/launchschedule.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

Only then can the team submit a written and video proposal that includes the names and justifications for their choices.\n\nThe video cannot be more than three minutes long, and the essay should not exceed 300 words.

Indigenous names are encouraged, but any team proposing one must be led by a member of an Indigenous community.\n\nAdditionally, the name of the exoplanet and its host star need to follow the same theme, meaning they must be related in some way.\n\nTeams cannot submit names of people, pets or organizations.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nJust 14 days after launching, the world’s most complex space observatory has already overcome some of its greatest challenges. The James Webb Space Telescope successfully completed the unfolding of its giant gold mirror on Saturday.\n\n“I am so proud of the team – spanning continents and decades – that delivered this first-of-its kind achievement,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “Webb’s successful deployment exemplifies the best of what NASA has to offer: the willingness to attempt bold and challenging things in the name of discoveries still unknown.”\n\nIt’s the largest mirror NASA has ever built, but its size created a unique problem. The mirror was so large that it couldn’t fit inside a rocket. Engineers designed the telescope as a series of moving parts that can fold origami-style and fit inside a 16-foot (5-meter) space for launch.\n\nThe mirror can extend 21 feet and 4 inches (6.5 meters) – a massive length that will allow it to collect more light from objects in space. The more light the mirror can collect, the more details the telescope can observe.\n\nA look back in time\n\nIn addition to investigating the wealth of planets outside of our solar system, the observatory will peer back to some of the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang and explore the very structure of the universe. Webb will act as an infrared sleuth, detecting light that is invisible to us and revealing otherwise hidden regions of space, including distant corners of our universe.\n\nAnd in order for the observatory to achieve those goals, the mirror’s 18 hexagonal gold-coated segments had to unfold and lock together in perfect sequence.\n\nThe precarious process began on Wednesday when the spacecraft deployed a secondary mirror’s support structure. Although much of the focus has been on Webb’s iconic gold mirror, the light collected by it will actually hit a smaller, secondary 2.4-foot (0.74-meter) mirror. This relatively tiny mirror is what directs infrared light to Webb’s science instruments.\n\nThree nearly 25-feet-long (7.6-meter-long) struts support this little mirror. Those were successfully lowered into place, locked and latched on January 5.\n\n“Webb’s secondary mirror had to deploy in microgravity, and in extremely cold temperatures, and it ultimately had to work the first time without error,” said Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n“It also had to deploy, position, and lock itself into place to a tolerance of about one and a half millimeters, and then it has to stay extremely stable while the telescope points to different places in the sky – and that’s all for a secondary mirror support structure that is over 7 meters in length.”\n\nThis is what Webb's iconic primary mirror looks like when its segments are fitted together. Chris Gunn/NASA\n\nWebb’s gold mirror began to take shape as the first of the two primary wings was unfolded and latched on Friday. These wings are side panels that hold three mirror segments each. This was followed by the unfolding and latching of the second panel on the other side Saturday.\n\nRisky, painstaking process\n\nAll of Webb’s deployments since launch have been controlled from the ground by a dedicated team working 12-hour shifts to ensure that Webb aces each achievement on its journey.\n\nUnfolding the mirrors didn’t take long – only about five minutes per side panel, thanks to a motor-driven process. But the meticulous latching of the panels into place took two hours for each one.\n\nThis artist's illustrations shows the Webb telescope as it appears in space after it's completely set up. Adriana Manrique Gutierrez/CIL/GSFC/NASA\n\nNow that Webb’s mirror and tennis court-size sunshield are in place, the telescope is considered to be “fully deployed.”\n\n“The successful completion of all of the Webb Space Telescope’s deployments is historic,” said Gregory L. Robinson, Webb program director at NASA, in a statement. “This is the first time a NASA-led mission has ever attempted to complete a complex sequence to unfold an observatory in space – a remarkable feat for our team, NASA, and the world.”\n\nIt will spend the next two weeks traveling to reach its intended orbit, which is about a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth.\n\nDuring that time, the telescope will make small adjustments to the mirror segments and make a final trajectory adjustment to insert itself into an orbit that reaches beyond the moon.\n\n“While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. “Each feat already achieved and future accomplishment is a testament to the thousands of innovators who poured their life’s passion into this mission.”\n\nA technically complex feat\n\nSensors, rather than images, have helped Webb’s team monitor the spacecraft as it executed and completed each task.\n\nInitially, NASA considered adding cameras to the spacecraft to help with this process, but they were deemed unnecessary for several reasons. The large telescope has come to life in space by unfolding and unfurling multiple components, which have repeatedly changed its configuration. Webb is also incredibly shiny, so it would be difficult to reduce glare for the cameras. And they also would have added risk to an already incredibly complex design.\n\n“Webb’s built-in sense of ‘touch’ (for example, switches and various mechanical, electrical, and temperature sensors) provides much more useful information than mere surveillance cameras can,” said Paul Geithner, technical deputy project manager for the Webb telescope at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, in a statement.\n\nOnce Webb reaches orbit, the telescope will go through a period of setting up shop in space that lasts for about five months, which involves cooling down, aligning and calibrating its instruments. All of the instruments also will go through a checkout process to see how they are functioning.\n\nWebb will begin to collect data and its first images later in 2022, and those are expected to be released in June or July, forever changing the way we see and understand the universe.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/11/spacex-crew-10-launch-starliner-astronauts-return/82229350007/", "title": "SpaceX Crew-10 launch to pave way for Starliner astronauts' return", "text": "An upcoming routine SpaceX mission to send a crew of astronauts to the International Space Station bears a little more significance this time around.\n\nWhen a mission known as Crew-10 launches as early as Wednesday, its arrival in orbit will pave the way for the crew of the Boeing Starliner to finally come home. Those two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, have unexpectedly remained at the space station since June after NASA determined that the troubled Starliner spacecraft wasn't up to the task of transporting them back.\n\nWilmore and Williams were instead months ago folded into the Crew-9 mission when its spacefarers docked at the orbital outpost in September on the SpaceX vehicle selected for their return.\n\nBut Williams and Wilmore weren't able to travel back to Earth right away for two critical reasons: The Crew-9 astronauts had a six-month mission of their own to complete before departing the space station. And, per NASA protocol, the team would have to wait on their successors to arrive.\n\nNow, that could happen in a matter of days if the spacefarers of Crew-10 are able embark on a short trip to the space station on a SpaceX Dragon capsule.\n\nHere's everything to know about the Crew-10 mission, including its role in ending the Starliner saga.\n\nWhat is the SpaceX Crew-10 mission?\n\nAs the name suggests, Crew-10 is SpaceX's tenth science rotation mission to the International Space Station.\n\nThe missions, most of which last about six months, are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program. The program allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles, freeing up NASA to focus on its Artemis lunar program and other deep space missions, including future crewed expeditions to Mars.\n\nSpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket – one of the most active in the world – to launch the crew missions from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Once in orbit, the astronauts aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule then seperate from the rocket to continue onto the space station.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner was meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its status remains unclear after its botched inaugural crewed flight test. In September, the Starliner vehicle undocked from the space station without its crew for a parachute-assisted landing in New Mexico.\n\nMeet the astronauts of Crew-10\n\nThe Crew-10 mission includes four spacefarers:\n\nNASA astronaut Anne McClain , of Spokane, Washington, mission commander;\n\n, of Spokane, Washington, mission commander; NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers , of Colorado, mission pilot;\n\n, of Colorado, mission pilot; Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), a mission specialist;\n\nof the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), a mission specialist; Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, a mission specialist.\n\nWhen will the Crew-10 mission launch for ISS?\n\nAs of Monday, Crew-10 was expected to board the Dragon for a launch at 7:48 p.m. EST Wednesday, with an anticipated arrival at the ISS the next morning.\n\nThe upcoming potential launch comes after NASA twice delayed the Crew-10 mission, originally anticipated to get off the ground in February.\n\nNASA initially announced in December that the launch had been pushed to late March to give SpaceX more time to prepare a new Dragon capsule for liftoff. The launch date was then moved back up to mid-March – most likely due to pressure from President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk – when NASA decided to instead use a \"previously flown\" Dragon named Endurance.\n\nWhen will Starliner astronauts return with Crew-9?\n\nIf Crew-10 launches as scheduled, the Starliner crew could return to Earth as early as Sunday, March 16, a NASA spokesman told USA TODAY.\n\nThe tentative return date would allow for a few days of handover activities when Crew-10 arrives at the space station – a crucial process for the outgoing astronauts to help the arriving spacefarers familiarize themselves with their new home.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore, the two astronauts of the Starliner crew, would then depart the station with Crew-9. That mission included a truncated crew of two – NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – in order to leave two extra seats on its Dragon capsule for the Starliner crew.\n\nOnce Crew-9 undocks on the Dragon, they would make a splashdown landing off the Florida coast.\n\nCrew-10 astronauts arrive at Kennedy Space Center, address media\n\nThe Crew-10 spacefarers arrived Friday at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral and have since participated in a dress rehearsal ahead of the launch, donning their SpaceX space suits.\n\nSpaceX has also conducted a static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket, which as of Sunday is upright on the launch pad.\n\nMcClain, the mission's commander, told media Friday that Crew-10 has been in constant contact with the Crew-9 astronauts, including the Starliner crew.\n\n\"We are going to take a little bit of an adventure,\" McClain told media on Friday, as reported by Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We're ready to high-five them, bring them home.\"\n\nContributing: Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Dix\n\nSpecial to the Record-Courier\n\nAn illustration by a Kent artist will be featured on a new United States first class postage stamp that debuts in June.\n\nThe illustration is of the new James Webb Space Telescope, the one that succeeds the orbiting Hubble Telescope that has expanded our knowledge of the universe. Launched into space last December, the new telescope has been stationed one million miles up in a position in which the gravitational pulls of earth and the sun are equal.\n\nThe artist is James Vaughan, a graduate of Roosevelt High School (Class of 1973), who spent a year at Hiram College before continuing to pursue his education at Columbia College of Chicago, a private institution of higher education that specializes in the arts.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAlways interested in science and technology, Vaughan has developed a solid reputation for using art to depict subjects that for many might be daunting. Science Magazine, for its February 2016 edition, contacted Vaughan to do its cover for a story the magazine was developing on the James Webb Space Telescope that NASA had contracted with Northrop Grumman and Ball Aerospace & Technology to build. The illustration he created will go on the new postage stamp.\n\nThe telescope is named for America’s NASA administrator who served during the space race with the Soviets in the 1960s. Because it was under construction in 2016, Vaughan had to fashion his magazine illustration from engineering drawings that Northrop Grumman shared with him. The Science Magazine cover, the basis for the new postage stamp, shows a device attached to a solar panel about the size of a tennis court. With solar power, the telescope will employ infrared photography to peer deep into space. It will capture images farther away than anyone has ever seen and help unravel mysteries of the universe.\n\nAmazingly, Vaughan had to re-invent himself to do illustrations like the James Webb Space Telescope because of the changing technology of art. For much of his career, relying on photography, he specialized in Fashion Photography in Chicago.\n\nHe eventually returned to Kent, to reside closer to his older siblings. A sister, Ginger Vaughan, was teaching art at Kent State. Benefitting from acquaintances at the University, Vaughan taught himself Photoshop and other applications and began working out of his home on North Willow Street. Demand for his services picked up. When the new James Webb Space Telescope stamp is issued, business activity for Vaughan may grow even stronger.\n\nI asked Vaughan to name a teacher who had been a major influence. He quickly mentioned Ken Gessford, the Roosevelt art teacher, now retired, as well as several social science teachers.\n\nVaughan’s ability with science subjects may come naturally. His father, the late Paul Vaughan, a Purdue educated engineer, served as Director of Research at Goodyear eventually leaving to found FILMCO in Aurora.\n\nEdith Chase Symposium\n\nElsewhere, we all have an opportunity to learn what we in Northeast Ohio must confront if we want to improve our water whose quality has been, and is continuing to be, damaged by various forms of pollution as well as by man-made impervious surfaces where water collects and stagnates.\n\nKyle Dreyfuss-Wells, the Chief Executive Officer of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, will be the presenter at the Edith Chase Symposium Friday, May 20 at Kent State’s College of Architecture and Environmental Design.

Women with normal weights and big bellies were 32% more likely to die during the study than obese women, according to the study, led by Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.\n\n“Often times, we think if we’re a normal weight, then we’re OK,” said Leslie Cho, head of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who wasn’t involved in the new study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine. “But weight is not as important as your level of fitness and where you hold your fat.”\n\nSo just how big a belly is considered risky?\n\nPeople can calculate their waist-hip ratio by dividing their waist measurement by their hip measurement, Lopez-Jimenez said.\n\nMen have “central obesity” if their waist-hip ratio is 0.9 or more, according to the World Health Organization. In women, central obesity is defined as a ratio of 0.85 or more.\n\n“Not all fat is equal,” Lopez-Jimenez said.\n\nJust as there are “good” and “bad” types of cholesterol, there are different types of fat, Lopez-Jimenez said. “The fat around the belly might look the same under the microscope as fat from the arms or legs, but it’s much more active,” he said.\n\nBelly fat appears to be especially unhealthy, because it’s often deposited in the liver, where it makes inflammatory substances that contribute to diabetes and heart disease, Lopez-Jimenez said.\n\nThe study is a reminder of the limitations of assessing a person’s risk of heart disease or death with only the body mass index, or BMI, Cho said.\n\nThe BMI is a ratio of weight and height. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered healthy; a BMI of 25 to 29.9 suggests overweight; while a BMI over 30 indicates obesity.\n\n“If you just look at BMI, you’re not getting the whole picture,” said psychologist Martin Binks, a spokesman for the Obesity Society and an associate professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.\n\n“If someone has 50 pounds of body fat spread all over their body, they have a very different risk profile than if the fat is all in their stomach,” Binks said.\n\nFat deposited below the belt -- on the legs and buttocks -- appears to offer some protection for the heart, although doctors aren’t sure exactly why, Lopez-Jimenez said.\n\nHe said his study suggests that people should be conscious of their waist-hip measurements and strive to build muscle, rather than just shed pounds.\n\n“When people lose weight, some of their weight they lose will be muscle mass, if they don’t exercise,” Lopez-Jimenez said. “If you just lose weight but don’t build muscle, you may not be improving your health that much.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/16/adult-obesity-decline-study-ozempic/77027360007/", "title": "New study finds first US obesity decline in 10 years. Is Ozempic a ...", "text": "For the first time in a decade, adult obesity in the United States dropped last year, a new study has found, and researchers are curious how the rise in popularity of weight loss drugs like Ozempic may have played a role.\n\nPublished in JAMA Health Forum on Friday, the study, \"Changes in Adult Obesity Trends in the US,\" found that between 2022 and 2023, obesity in American adults between ages 26-75 dropped about 0.15%.\n\n\"On the percentage level, the decrease appears quite small ... but when you actually look at the population, what that translates to is hundreds of thousands of people who were in an obese category and are no longer in that category,\" study author Benjamin Rader, scientific director at Boston Children's Hospital, told USA TODAY. \"The population impact, we think, is quite big.\"\n\nBefore 2023, between 2013-2022, obesity numbers were on an uphill climb. But they plateaued in 2022 before taking a slight turn south.\n\nJohn Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, who also contributed to the study, said the greatest decrease was among Black women ages 66-75. This tracks with national trends, he added.\n\nThe Intake Resource Center found in a survey of 1,000 Americans last year that 39% of women asked their medical practitioners to be prescribed Ozempic, compared to 23% of men. And another study published by market researcher CivicScience last year found that Black Americans are most likely − at 26% − to take Ozempic or another weight loss drug.\n\nThe study also found that the largest decrease of obesity occurred in the South. This corresponds with CivicScience's study, too. The top five states with the most online searches for Ozempic were Louisiana, Tennessee, West Virginia, Florida and Mississippi, CivicScience published.\n\nHow was the study conducted?\n\nResearchers surveyed nearly 17 million American adults ages 26-75, with about 51% being female and 48% male, according to the study. Rader said the research team partnered with Optum, a clinical data aggregator, to collect body mass index (BMI) information from electronic medical records, such as doctors' notes and lab reports, and insurance claim data. The researchers analyzed BMI data collected between 2013 and 2023.\n\nWhat other factors could have contributed to the obesity decline?\n\nBrownstein said there's no way of knowing, right now, the exact cause for the dip in obesity, but weight loss drugs like Ozempic are likely a leading factor. Other contributing factors may include better access to healthcare and new food and drug guidelines, he added.\n\nObesity remains a prevalent disease\n\nDespite results from the recent study, obesity remain prevalent in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023, more than one in three adults had obesity. For perspective, before 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%. Today, at least 20% of adults in each state live with obesity.\n\nWhat is Ozempic?\n\nOzempic, the household name for semaglutide, is a prescription medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity in adults. It can be taken by injection or orally.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Follow her on X and Instagram @gretalcross. Story idea?

Here's why.", "text": "Dorrett Reid never had a problem with her weight — until her surgery.\n\nThe Wilmington resident had an operation on her upper back about a year ago. Because she couldn't move around a lot while she recovered, she found herself sad and eating too much chicken curry and rice.\n\nWhen she stepped on the scale in March, she was 180 pounds. More than 30 pounds overweight.\n\nReid is one of the thousands of Delawareans who has struggled with her weight.\n\nThe adult obesity rate in Delaware is 30.7 percent, which is the 23rd highest in the country, according to a recent report from the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The obesity rate has more than doubled in the state in recent decades. And as a result, so have hypertension and diabetes rates.\n\nThe reasons are many.\n\nIn the past year, Reid has been able to regain control of her health. She's lost about 30 pounds so far by working out multiple times a week and buying healthy food at the grocery store.\n\n\"I’m 69 years old. I feel like 40,\" she said. \"I'm feeling great.\"\n\nHealth experts say there isn't one cause to attribute to Delaware's obesity problem, but rather a combination of a person's environment, a sedentary lifestyle and one's sugar intake.\n\n\"It's a triple whammy,\" said Dr. Omar Khan, lead physician for primary care and community medicine at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nHome is where the unhealthy habits are\n\nWhen registered dietitian Robin Hayes works with new clients, most think routinely eating bacon is normal. That's what they ate as kids.\n\nPeople's childhood dinners and home environments often dictate what their meals are like now, she said.\n\n\"When I see someone, it's like I'm peeling an onion,\" she said. \"It's hard to break those generational things.\"\n\nIf people didn't grow up eating fruits and vegetables, it's likely they aren't eating them now, she said.\n\nRegularly eating fresh produce is also a generational mindset, Hayes said. Parents in the 60s and 70s served their children canned vegetables and starches because that's what was available.\n\nHaving organic produce that is readily available is a relatively new concept, she said.\n\nAllison Karpyn, a University of Delaware professor who studies obesity, said the disease is tightly connected to access and income.\n\n\"When people are in a situation where they have to pinch pennies, they just go to junk food,\" she said. And there's often plenty of that at the same time and in the same place there's little access to fresh food.\n\nKarpyn, the associate director of the university's Center for Research in Education and Social Policy, said there's several communities in Sussex County and in Wilmington that are classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as food deserts. Those are areas where low-income neighborhoods have limited access to a grocery store.\n\nAs of November 2016, there were 642 fast-food restaurants in Delaware, almost 60 percent of which are in New Castle County, according the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nKarpyn added that how foods are displayed in a local grocery store can impact a person's eating habits.\n\nFor the past three years, she's helped lead a study analyzing how placement of healthier foods in Delaware ShopRites and other area grocery stores can influence what a person buys. Some examples of repositioned items include putting bottles of water at eye level on shelves and featuring whole grain bread more prominently than white bread.\n\nAlthough the study isn't over, the small changes have also shown a positive effect, she said.\n\nLiving a sedentary life\n\nA year ago, when Edith Chewning's friends wanted to go shopping, she waited in the car. She didn't have enough energy to walk around the mall.\n\nThe New Castle resident was on the verge of high blood pressure. Her doctors were concerned.\n\nBut one day, she decided to go for a short walk. Now she walks a mile everyday, usually at Christiana Mall.\n\nChewning, 66, attributes her 60 pound weight loss to her daily walks and eating healthier foods.\n\n\"My doctors are very impressed,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nKhan, the physician at Christiana Care, believes the lack of wellness culture in the state has been a factor for obese Delawareans. People simply aren't exercising, he said.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by the Division of Public Health, 41. 7 percent of Delawareans did not meet the CDC's guidelines for physical activity. The agency recommends adults exercise 150 minutes a week at a moderate intensity.\n\nThe doctor said he's noticed that states with lower obesity rates (such as Colorado and Vermont) use their physical characteristics to their advantage when it comes to exercise. That's not really the case in Delaware.\n\n\"If you see less folks exercising around you, then it's not a part of the culture and expectation,\" he said.\n\nIt's likely that about 20 percent of adults haven't done any type of exercise in the last month, he said.\n\nSugar, sugar and more sugar\n\nA year ago, Chewning was struggling with depression and financial issues. To cope, she ate everything she knew she shouldn't.\n\n\"It was convenient and easy and close,\" she said. \"I was drinking sodas and eating ice cream. Everything you don't eat on an everyday basis, I was eating.\"\n\nMarianne Carter, director of Delaware Center for Health Promotion, said sugar, specifically soda, is still contributing to obesity rates in Delaware. Most people still don't think about the amount of calories they're drinking.\n\nJuice is also a likely contributing factor to the child obesity rate. About 17 percent of 10- to 17-year-olds in Delaware are obese, the Trust for America's Health study said.\n\nMost juice drinks are disguised as pure fruit juice and actually contain mostly sugar, said Karypn, the UD professor.\n\n\"They are just as bad as soda, yet some feel it's an important part of a diet,\" Karypn said. She added that not enough people in Delaware choose to drink water as their default beverage.\n\nThere has been some progress in the state when it comes to drinking soda, said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health.\n\nAbout 75 percent of adults surveyed said in 2016 they drink no or less than one sugar-sweetened drinks a day, according to the state's Behavioral Risk Factor Survey.\n\nEliminating soda is one of the easiest diet behaviors to change, Rattay said. During her clinical work as a pediatrician, Rattay found eliminating a 12 ounce soft drink from one's diet could make a difference of up to ten pounds a year.\n\nCarter said she would like to see the state implement a soda tax, with the hopes that the increase in price will discourage people from buying the drink.\n\n\"It’s just so easy to be overweight,\" she said.\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nObstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time.\n\nSnoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea — but at some point in our lives, we all snore. A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles — and before we know it, we’re unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore.\n\n“Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. “When it’s loud, raucous snoring, or it’s interrupted by pauses in breathing, that’s where we start to get concerned.”\n\nIt’s estimated that at least 25 million American adults and 936 million adults between the ages of 30 and 69 worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed.\n\nSleep apnea can be dangerous\n\nThe condition is called “obstructive” sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea — in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe — obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues.\n\n“You’re making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can’t. Often you aren’t aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nIf left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or depression, and even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\nHow can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG.\n\nIs snoring bad?\n\nSnoring is a key indicator, so it’s a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no quiet gentle snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call “cute.”\n\nIf your partner's snores can be heard though a closed door, it's time to see a sleep specialist. Adobe Stock\n\n“We’re talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,” Dasgupta said. “Some of the very descriptive bed partners of my patients with obstructive sleep apnea describe their partners’ snores as listening to a ‘dying bear’ or a scene from ‘Jurassic Park.’”\n\nHow tired are you?\n\nBeing really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep, Robbins said. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea.\n\n“Falling asleep anytime you have a moment — sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater — those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book, “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But Are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nPartners often observe apnea\n\nMany people — if not most — have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night, unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking.\n\n“The O stands for observed apnea, and that’s actually worse than just snoring,” Dasgupta said. “An apnea means no flow of air — no air coming in no air going out. You’re not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag.”\n\nBed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,” Robbins said.\n\nSleep apnea and high blood pressure\n\nObstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body’s sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time.\n\nWhile having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea — they also lower blood pressure.\n\nWeight and sleep apnea\n\nWhat’s your body mass index? That’s a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 — and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese.\n\nPeople who are obese or extremely obese (with a BMI of 35 and above) are frequently found to have obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring.\n\n“Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,” Robbins said.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn’t seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added.\n\nAge, gender, neck circumstance are predictors\n\nMuscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being older than age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be or could turn into obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nThere is some good news: Studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages.\n\nHaving a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Now you don’t want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one’s neck build at night,” Dasgupta said. “The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea.”\n\nAre you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more “belly fat,” which can make breathing in general more difficult.\n\n“However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,” Dasgupta said.\n\nAre you at high risk for sleep apnea?\n\nNow it’s time to score your risk.\n\nGive yourself a point for every “yes” answer to these questions: Do you snore? Are you tired during the day? Does your partner witness you snoring? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you overweight? Are you older? Do you have a larger neck circumference? Are you a man?\n\nIf you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.\n\n“Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,” Dasgupta said. “You don’t have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice.”\n\nBut don’t ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: “Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention.”\n\nIf your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn’t likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said.\n\n“It’s always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it’s worthwhile getting evaluated,” he said. “If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can’t fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it’s not always about yourself.”\n\nHow to treat sleep apnea?\n\nThe treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night.\n\nWeight loss can significantly decrease — or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward.\n\nIf anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended.\n\nMild cases of sleep apnea may respond to “positional therapy,” a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring.\n\n“I’m a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,” Dasgupta said.\n\n“You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,” Robbins suggested.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/health/colonoscopy-cancer-death-study/index.html", "title": "Colonoscopies: New study questions their effectiveness | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nColonoscopies are a dreaded rite of passage for many middle-age adults. The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/09/18/bpa-link-to-obesity/1577779/", "title": "Study links chemical BPA to obesity in children, teens", "text": "USATODAY\n\nKids with highest levels of BPA more likely to be obese\n\nStudy can't prove BPA is a cause of obesity but adds to concerns about chemicals\n\nOther studies linked BPA to diabetes, cancers and behavior issues\n\nKids with higher levels of the widely used substance BPA in their bodies are more likely to be obese, according to the first large-scale, nationally representative study to link an environmental chemical with obesity in children and teens.\n\nResearchers from NYU School of Medicine acknowledge that their study's design doesn't allow them to definitely conclude that BPA, or bisphenol A, caused the children's obesity. Rates of obesity have been rising for three decades as Americans have become more sedentary.\n\nBut the findings, in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, add to a growing body of research -- in both humans and animals -- questioning BPA's safety, says Philip Landrigan, director of Children's Environmental Health Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\n\"It's a credible study and it has to be given some attention,\" says Landrigan, who was not involved with the study.\n\nIn particular, the study adds to the notion that certain chemicals are \"obesogens\" that alter the body's metabolism, making it harder for people to lose weight, even with diet and exercise, says Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Are we programming people to fail?\" Birnbaum asks. \"That's the question we need to ask, instead of blaming people.\"\n\nExposure to BPA -- an estrogen-like chemical used in everything from plastic water bottles to the linings of metal cans and even the coatings on certain paper receipts -- is nearly ubiquitous. More than 92% of Americans over age 6 have detectable levels in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe new study drew on CDC surveys of 2,838 kids and teens, ages 6 to 19. Researchers found that more than 22% of those with the highest BPA level in their urine were obese, compared to 10% of those with the lowest levels.\n\nA study published last year, also based on CDC data, found similar patterns of obesity among American adults exposed to BPA.\n\nTo make sure that their results were reliable, authors of the new study factored a number of important considerations into their calculations -- including the children's race, age, income, sex, exposure to tobacco, number of calories consumed each day, number of hours spent watching TV and their caregiver's educational level.\n\nTheir results held up only for white children, says Leonardo Trasande, the study's main author, of NYU. In black and Hispanics, further analysis showed that the link between BPA and obesity could be due to chance.\n\nThe study's design doesn't allow researchers to definitively conclude that BPA made the children gain weight, Trasande says.\n\nIt's possible that obese children consume more BPA, such as through canned soda, Trasande says. It's also possible that obese children have higher BPA levels because the chemical is stored, and later released, from fat.\n\nTaken alone, the study might not make much of a case against BPA, Birnbaum says. But it's more powerful in light of the long list of earlier experiments in animals and cells linking BPA to obesity, diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, behavior problems and other issues, especially in animals exposed before birth.\n\nIn recent years, evidence has linked BPA to a variety of human ailments:\n\n-- A study published in Pediatrics last year found that girls exposed before birth to high levels of BPA were more likely to be anxious, depressed and hyperactive at age 3.\n\n-- Men with higher levels of BPA were two to four times more likely than others to have problems with sperm quality and quantity, according to a 2010 study in Fertility and Sterility.\n\n-- A 2008 study in JAMA linked high BPA levels in adults to diabetes, heart disease and abnormal liver function.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration banned BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups in July. Environmental groups also have pressured the agency to reduce or eliminate other sources of BPA.\n\nPediatric endocrinologist Larry Deeb says the new study provides enough evidence for parents to act, in spite of its limitations.\n\nHe suggests that parents buy only plastic sports bottles that are BPA-free, and avoid buying canned soups and vegetables.\n\n\"The conclusion seems to be to avoid BPA as much as possible,\" says Deeb, who specializes in treating obesity. \"Why do we have to expose ourselves to these things? Fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables are probably better for you, if you can afford them, which is always the rub.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/19/nearly-half-u-s-residents-obese-2030-harvard-study-finds/2699318001/", "title": "Nearly half US residents to be 'obese' in 2030, Harvard study finds", "text": "BOSTON – Waistlines of Americans continue to get wider, and unless habits change on a grand scale, obesity will soon be the norm.\n\nNearly half of the U.S. population is projected to be obese by 2030, and a quarter will struggle with severe obesity by that time, according to a new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nIn 10 years, 29 states are projected to have majority populations that are obese, the study says, and all states will have populations that are at least 35% obese.\n\n\"Obesity is going up in terms of the number of people who have it, and the degree or severity of obesity is going up,\" said Zachary Ward, a Harvard programmer and analyst who served as lead author of the report published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nForty percent of Americans adults are obese, and 18% suffer from severe obesity. The study predicts those numbers will balloon by 2030 to 49% and 24% respectively.\n\nResearchers predict severe obesity to be highest among women, non-Hispanic black adults and people who earn annual incomes below $50,000 per year. Among men, 21% are expected to be severely obese by 2030, compared with 28% of women.\n\n\"It used to be a rare condition,\" Ward said of the severe category, \"but it's increasing.\"\n\nState-Level Trends in Obesity with Zach Ward\n\nObesity versus severe obesity\n\nObesity is measured by body mass index, BMI, which is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. A BMI of above 30 is considered obese; above 35 is considered severely obese, which typically means having 100 pounds or more of excess weight.\n\n\"People are at a much higher risk (with severe obesity) for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, some types of cancer and mortality as well,\" Ward said. \"There's big health implications.\"\n\nObesity is expected to reach the highest levels in the South, which already leads the nation. Ward pointed to the South's higher populations of African Americans and low-income subgroups, which are both more likely to be obese.\n\nStates with the highest projected 2030 obesity rates are: Oklahoma, 58.4%; Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, 58.2%; West Virginia, 57.5%; and Louisiana, 57.2%.\n\nThe highest populations of severe obesity are projected to be in Arkansas, 32.6%; Oklahoma, 31.7%; and Mississippi, 31.7%.\n\nStates or districts with the lowest projected obesity rates are: District of Columbia, 35.3%; Colorado, 38.2%; Hawaii, 41.3%; California, 41.5%; Massachusetts, 42.3%; and New York, 42.8%.\n\nResearchers conducted the study by reviewing data from 6.2 million people who took part in phone surveys on behavior risks carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1993 to 2016.\n\nPeople typically self-report greater height and lower weight than what's accurate. Ward said researchers compared self-reported figures with the actual measured statistics in each state. They used trends from that data to project obesity rates for specific states, income levels and sub-populations.\n\nAlthough the Harvard study did not identify causes for the rapid spike in obesity, health experts say Americans eat more food high in calories and fat and exercise less as more work has shifted from outside to the desk.\n\n\"It's clear that we're not going to be able to treat our way out of this epidemic. Losing weight is difficult,\" Ward said. \"It's hard for clinicians to treat obesity. I think prevention really has to be the key to combating this epidemic.\"\n\nHe said \"real structural changes, policy changes\" at the local, state and national level are needed to reverse the obesity trends.\n\n\"Individual behavior change has not worked so far.

People are considered obese if they have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight. People are severely (or extremely) obese if they have a BMI (a height-weight ratio) of 40 or higher. That's roughly 100 or more pounds overweight.\n\n\"Moderate obesity (a BMI of 30 or more) has adverse health effects, but severe obesity is in a different league,\" Sturm says. Severely obese people have far more complex health issues and create different challenges for the health care system, he says. \"Moderate obesity increases health care costs by 20% to 30% compared to those at a healthy weight, where severe obesity more than doubles health care costs.\"\n\nSturm and colleagues write in the paper: \"Physician offices and hospitals require additional resources for severely obese patients, who exceed limits on standard measuring and lifting equipment and may not fit standard imaging equipment, operating tables or wheelchairs.\"\n\nThe new study is based on results of a telephone survey of about 3 million people over a decade from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because people tend to under-report their weight (more so for women) and over-report their height (more so for men), the researchers adjusted the findings for that potential bias.\n\nThe research, published online by the International Journal of Obesity found:\n\n-- Severe obesity is about 50% higher among women than men.\n\n-- It is about twice as high among blacks as Hispanics and whites.\n\n-- The percentage of severely obese who are under 40 is similar to those who are over 40.\n\n\"The younger group should normally be less overweight or obese,\" Sturm says. \"Yet for severe obesity, the young age group is already similar.\"\n\nSturm speculates that one reason for the overall increase in severe obesity may be that \"there is some genetic vulnerability among people, and in this environment where there's an overabundance of food everywhere, people have become severely obese instead of just overweight.\"\n\nGary Foster, director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia, says, \"It's troubling that those most likely to experience the adverse effects of obesity are increasing so quickly. This has significant economic and public health consequences.\"\n\nThese data suggest the need to engage those with extreme obesity in evaluating bariatric surgery options, Foster says. \"We also need more treatments aimed at this group.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/15/fast-food-allergies-asthma/1835399/", "title": "Health roundup: Fast food linked to allergies, asthma", "text": "Kim Painter, Special for USA TODAY\n\nYour Tuesday morning health roundup:\n\nDiet and allergies: Kids who eat a lot of fast food have a significantly increased risk of asthma, eczema and allergy symptoms such as runny noses and itchy eyes, a large new international study shows.

The Colorado high court ruled that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution – the anti-insurrection clause – bars Trump from the ballot because he engaged in insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe Colorado Republican Party has already appealed the state high court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision from Maine’s secretary of state will almost surely also be challenged, but that appeal is taking a different judicial route. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said attorneys will first file \"a legal objection\" in the Maine state court system, though that case could also make its way to the U.S. high court.\n\n\"These partisan election interference efforts are a hostile assault on American democracy,\" Cheung said.\n\nIn her ruling disqualifying Trump, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said the former president participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection by employing \"a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol to prevent certification of the 2020 election and the peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nWhat – and when – will the Supreme Court rule?\n\nThis could take a while.\n\nThe nation’s highest court will probably be loath to quickly rule on the central question of whether Trump engaged in an insurrection that would bar him from office, according to Michael McConnell, a Stanford law professor and former federal judge who is a prominent figure in conservative legal circles. He said half the country would be furious and probably view the decision as illegitimate.\n\nThe court is therefore likely to resolve the case on more narrow, procedural grounds, he said, such as by ruling the anti-insurrection clause has to be implemented through congressional legislation.\n\n“Was it or wasn't an insurrection? Did he engage in it? These are things that reasonable people are going to disagree with, so I think the court is going to grasp for ways to handle the case that don't get to that ultimate question,” he said.\n\nSome conservative legal figures have argued Trump engaged in an insurrection that disqualifies him from office, including University of Chicago Law Professor William Baude, who clerked for both McConnell and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He and Minnesota law professor Michael Paulsen have argued that in a paper cited by the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nFormer federal Judge J. Michael Luttig, who was interviewed by President George W. Bush for a seat on the Supreme Court, has also come out forcefully behind the disqualification argument, posting on X (formerly Twitter) that there is “simply no answer to the constitutional case” brought in Colorado.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates, including Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Chris Christie, have widely spoken out against the disqualification effort, and Vivek Ramaswamy has pledged to remove his name from any primary ballot that doesn’t include Trump.\n\nTy Cobb, a former White House special counsel under Trump who has been critical of him in recent years, predicted the Supreme Court eventually will rule in Trump's favor by concluding the anti-insurrection clause does not apply to the president.\n\n\"Trump will be on the ballot everywhere,\" Cobb said.\n\nOther states may block Trump from the ballot\n\nBefore the Supreme Court can weigh in, other states may follow the lead of Colorado and Maine in seeking to keep Trump's name off of ballots.\n\nEfforts are underway in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, New Mexico, New York and Texas, among other states.\n\nAs Trump's attorneys have pointed out, some states have rejected moves to keep Trump off the ballot, including the Michigan Supreme Court\n\nLate this week, California Secretary of State Shirley Weber refused requests to remove Trump's name from the presidential primary ballot.\n\nTrump using legal woes on the campaign trail\n\nWhile lawyers argue about Trump's eligibility, Trump himself probably will use the Colorado and Maine decisions to argue that the \"deep state\" is trying to use the legal system to target him politically.\n\nTrump made the same argument after his indictments in four criminal cases filed throughout 2023.\n\nThe former president may also try to use his legal fight to boost his campaign. Already, he has posted commentary on Truth Social suggesting the Colorado decision could raise his poll numbers.\n\n\"Trump's been the only candidate in my lifetime who's gotten stronger after being attacked,\" said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston who has co-written a paper questioning the constitutional disqualification argument against Trump.\n\nThe Republican front-runner faces up to four criminal trials during the 2024 campaign year. That complicates his campaign schedule because he would have to present for proceedings in criminal trials.\n\nThe various appeals on ballot eligibility question are less onerous for Trump; he doesn't have to appear at any of the hearings.\n\nWhat happens if Trump is convicted?\n\nColorado and Maine officials have stayed their decisions until final court rulings. That means Trump will very likely be on Republican primary ballots in Colorado and Maine, both on March 5.\n\nEven if Trump prevails in the Colorado and Maine cases, the ballot eligibility fight might not be over – especially if he is convicted in a trial.\n\nTrump's trials could include ones in Washington, D.C., and Georgia that accuse him of conspiring to steal the 2020 election through efforts that led to the Capitol riot.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, and if he wins the Republican presidential nomination, opponents in some states may use the conviction to bolster their disqualification arguments in the general election.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/02/29/border-trump-biden-mitch-mcconnell-ivf-migrant-f1-caitlin-clark/72786062007/", "title": "Border, Biden, Trump, Mitch McConnell, IVF, Caitlin Clark, F1: Daily ...", "text": "President Joe Biden plans to make a rare visit to the southern border Thursday − the same day former President Donald Trump plans his own border stop.

For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race − already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life − into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream. There are so many photos of the president enjoying the classic summer dessert.\n\nThe president's connection to the delightful treat continued Sunday. Biden happened to announce his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race on National Ice Cream Day, July 20.\n\nThen again, according to Biden, everyday is National Ice Cream Day.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDemocratic lawmaker calls on Trump to step down too\n\nRep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., in a statement said Biden “made the difficult but selfless decision to pass the torch to the next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party to ensure that our democracy remains strong and true.”\n\n“The American people have made it clear that they want a new generation of leaders to run for President,” he said.\n\nGoldman urged Trump to follow Biden’s footsteps.\n\n“I urge Donald Trump to follow President Biden’s lead and put the country first by passing his party’s baton to a younger and healthier candidate who is not a convicted felon,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNC Gov. Cooper does not weigh in on VP chatter\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could be among those being considered to join the Democratic presidential ticket as Kamala Harris' vice president, if she is chosen to replace Joe Biden as the party's nominee. But Cooper didn't address those rumors in a brief statement posted to social media Sunday about Biden's departure from the race.\n\n\"I'm deeply grateful to call President Joe Biden my friend, and I thank him from the bottom of my heart for his service to our great nation,\" Cooper said in a post on X, which mainly focused on Biden's achievements as president.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nCalifornia senator endorses Harris for president\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from Kamala Harris’ home state, endorsed her for president Sunday.\n\nPadilla replaced Harris in Congress when she was tapped to join Joe Biden on the 2020 Democratic ticket.\n\n“From California to the White House, Vice President Harris has always led with courage and conviction,” Padilla wrote in a post on X, “I’m proud to endorse @KamalaHarris to unify our party and defeat Donald Trump.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nRep. Clyburn, credited for helping Biden win the 2020 primary, has endorsed Harris for president\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a long serving House leader who helped Biden secure the nomination in 2020, said in a statement he endorses Vice President Kamala Harris' bid to become the nominee now that Biden has dropped out.\n\n“One of President Biden’s first decisions as the nominee was to select a running mate that he believed possessed the values and vision necessary to continue this country’s pursuit toward a ‘more perfect union,’\" Clyburn said. \"I echo the good judgement he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for president.”\n\n−Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhen is Biden's address to the nation after dropping out of 2024 race?\n\nAccording to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement, Americans can expect to hear more from the president in the coming days.\n\n\"I will speak to the nation later this week in more to detail about my decision,\" the president wrote.\n\nHe did not give an exact date or time.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the DNC? Here's what to know about 2024 convention after Biden drops out of race\n\nOn the heels of Joe Biden's decision to end his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from scores of his own party leaders, all eyes are now on Chicago where the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off next month.\n\nThe DNC is slated to take place August 19 through August 22.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nJD Vance slams Biden and Harris\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance criticized Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ tenure in office in statement Sunday.\n\nThe Ohio senator, 39, called Biden the “worst” president of his lifetime and said Harris “has been right there with him every step of the way.”\n\n“President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on,\" Vance said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nSen. Coons, one of Biden's closest allies, backs Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and national co-chair of Biden’s election campaign, told CNN Sunday that he supports Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party’s next nominee.\n\n“I support Vice President Harris. I am very hopeful that we will come out of our convention next month united and that everyone who has expressed concerns and hopes and thoughts and fears in the last few months, we'll continue to support the ticket that will win this fall,” he said.\n\n“And we'll see what happens in terms of the choice for a running mate. But I think our President Joe Biden has made his endorsement clear. And I think that is the most important endorsement that we could all be paying attention to today.”\n\nHe said earlier in the interview that Harris “has fought hard for freedoms and for rights of Americans and she is a genuine leader.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIllinois Gov. Pritzker praises Biden, jabs Trump in statement\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another Democrat who could be vetted to join the Democratic presidential ticket now that Joe Biden has dropped out, praised the former president Sunday before focusing on Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on X Pritzker commended Biden for working across the aisle to pass infrastructure legislation and shepherd the country past the COVID-19 pandemic. He then criticized Trump for his 34 felony convictions and stances on issues like abortion.\n\n“As we extend our gratitude toward President Biden and reflect on his many accomplishments, we must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House,” Pritzker said. “I will work everyday to ensure that he does not win in November.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nThe 'ultimate statesman'\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus PAC in a statement called Biden the “ultimate statesman” in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“He’s dedicated his entire career, amid great personal sacrifice, in service to the values of democracy; civility, freedom and opportunity… Americans and democracy loving people around the world owe Joe Biden a great debt of gratitude,” the statement says.\n\nThe group added that it joins Biden in “supporting Kamala Harris as our party’s nominee.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden among most significant US presidents, Pete Buttigieg says\n\nTransportation Secretary and former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday lauded Joe Biden as one of the \"most consequential presidents in American history,\" after the president announced he would not seek another term.\n\nButtigieg has popped up as a potential vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris, who is the frontrunner to replace Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. But the former South Bend, Indiana mayor did not address those rumors in his brief social media statement that focused on Biden's presidency.\n\n\"I am so proud to serve under his leadership, and thankful for his unwavering focus on what is best for our country,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nKamala Harris thanks Biden for service, says she will seek nomination\n\nKamala Harris said in a statement that she is “deeply grateful” to Joe Biden and his family: “With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else.\n\nShe said she is honored to have his endorsement.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she said.\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. says he commends Biden for stepping down\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he commends President Joe Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n“His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration — and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles — that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump,” said Kennedy.\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to “return to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.”\n\n“Instead of anointing a candidate hand-picked by DNC elites, the party should use neutral polling to identify the candidate who can best beat Donald Trump. The delegates should then select a nominee based on this information,” he said. “If they had done this to begin with, I would not have had to leave the Democratic Party.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nYoung voter group endorses Harris for president\n\nVoters of Tomorrow, a political advocacy group representing Gen Z, endorsed Kamala Harris for president in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe organization has chapters in 20 states and a volunteer presence across the country.

But, “Joe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election — how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic Party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.”\n\nBiden, who served as vice president during the eight years of Obama’s presidency, has never backed down from a fight, Obama said.\n\n“For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” the former president said. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country — and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”\n\nBiden has been “one of America’s most consequential presidents,” Obama said, and “a patriot of the highest order.\n\nObama’s statement made no mention of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden adviser Klain bemoans ‘donors and electeds’ who pushed the president\n\nJoe Biden’s former White House chief of staff Ron Klain called on Democrats to unite behind Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee – and took at shot at Biden’s Democratic detractors in doing so.\n\n“Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it’s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign — our outstanding VP, Kamala Harris!

Project 2025 is a 900-page, sweeping conservative plan for the next GOP administration.\n\n“If President Biden is incapable of running a presidential race, how can he lead our nation for another six months?” Roberts said in a statement Sunday. “In the interest of national security and the safety of our citizens, President Biden must immediately resign.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nWhitmer says her job 'remains the same' after Biden drops out\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that her role in the 2024 election is unchanged in light of Joe Biden’s decision to leave the race, though she didn't explicitly say she wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhitmer’s name has risen to the top of the list of potential vice presidential nominees who could join a new Democratic ticket led by Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, the Michigan governor said in a social media post, that her “job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nSanders praises Biden’s tenure in office\n\nSen.

Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.”\n\nThe Clintons also offered praise for Biden, saying he lifted the country out of an unprecedented pandemic, created millions of new jobs, rebuilt a battered economy, strengthened democracy and restored America’s standing in the world.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWho will replace Biden? Harris is the immediate frontrunner\n\nKamala Harris appears to be the leading candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s nominee in the 2024 election, after the president dropped his reelection bid amid rising concerns about his age following his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden emphatically endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nIf formally nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman at the top of a major party presidential ticket.

Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nJohnson said Biden’s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump “invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.”\n\n“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,” he said. “As second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice — not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a “patriotic American who has always put his nation first.”\n\n“His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in “best interest” of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden’s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the “best interest of the country and party,” in a statement Sunday.\n\n“President Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,” Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“Now it’s time for our nation to come together,” Beshear added in the post. “We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued a statement that praised Biden's accomplishments as president but did not address whether Harris should be the nominee. \"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful,\" he said.\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nDNC chair says Democrats will launch process of choosing new candidate\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in the coming days Democrats will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”\n\nHarrison said the process will be “governed by established rules and procedures of the Party.”\n\n“Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,” Harrison said, adding that the American people will hear “in short order” from the Democratic Party on the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nThe DNC convention is set for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago, but Democratic National Committee leaders have planned for a virtual roll-call vote before Aug. 7 to satisfy concerns with ballot deadlines in several states.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nJosh Shapiro calls Biden a 'patriot'\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed Joe Biden as a “patriot” and commended his work as president in a social media post on Sunday shortly after the president announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race.“President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom,” Shapiro wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Shapiro has been floated as a potential Democratic presidential nominee to replace Biden, or as a vice presidential nominee if Kamala Harris takes over the top of the ticket. Shapiro did not mention Harris in his message Sunday.“I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania — the Commonwealth that raised him,” Shapiro said about Biden in the post.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nSchumer says Biden put 'his country, his party, and our future first'\n\nChuck Schumer shared in a post on X that \"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he's a truly amazing human being.\"\n\n\"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson who, in 1968 amid national unrest and turmoil within the Democratic Party over the Vietnam War, stunned the nation with his decision not to seek a second full term.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nWho could replace Biden?\n\nWith Biden's endorsement, Harris is the clear frontrunner to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee, but the party's bench of Democratic governors could also be in the mix including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nTrump knocks Biden after exit\n\nDonald Trump, in a post on his social media web site Truth Social after Biden’s exit, wrote: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!”\n\n“We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump added.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJill Biden reacts to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 race\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden on Sunday reposted the president's message with heart emojis. She also retweeted her husband's message endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/16/three-iowa-democrats-fighting-take-chuck-grassley-senate-abby-finkenauer-mike-franken-glenn-hurst/9332744002/", "title": "Meet the Iowa Democrats fighting to take on Sen.

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/16/ri-election-2022-campaign-politics-news-rhode-island-governor-2nd-congressional-providence-mayor/6797962001/", "title": "RI Election 2022: The latest news in the highest-profile campaigns", "text": "Here is the latest newsin the highest-profile 2022 races in Rhode Island, from governor to Congress to mayor of Providence and beyond.\n\nOCT. 26: GOP's Kalus rallies with \"Democrats for Ashley\"\n\nA group of Rhode Island Democrats crossed party lines and joined Republican candidate for governor Ashley Kalus Tuesday night at a rally in Pawtucket.\n\n“Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are rallying behind my campaign,\" Kalus said in a news release. \"Momentum is growing by the day, and we’re building broad coalitions of support in every corner of the state. I’m thrilled to have the backing of so many Democrats who recognize that it is time to put people over party.\"\n\nThe 10 people who identify as Democrats and publicly endorsed Kalus Tuesday were:\n\nFormer House Speaker Matthew Smith\n\nFormer North Providence Mayor Richard Fossa\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Ron Baccala\n\nNorth Providence Councilman Steve Loporchio\n\nFormer Providence state Rep. Joanne Giannini\n\nFormer Warwick Councilwoman Kathleen Egan Usler\n\nFormer Johnston Town Councilman Steve Macchioni\n\nFrank Demaio, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nDottie McCaffrey, former president of the Mount Pleasant Neighborhood Association\n\nPeter Marinucci, former Providence Ward 7/15 City Committee member\n\nThe Kalus campaign paid Smith $500 in July for consultant and professional services, according to filings with the state Board of Elections.\n\nOCT. 19: Former RI Supreme Court Judge Flanders backs Kalus at press conference on McKee's emergency energy powers\n\nFormer Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders has sided with Republican candidate for governor Ashley Kalus' disputed contention that the governor has the power to roll back electricity and gas rate hikes.\n\nKalus has argued - and Flanders on Wednesday agreed - that Gov. Dan McKee has emergency powers granted under a 40-year-old law enacted after the gasoline shortages of the 1970s to roll back rate hikes of 47% in electricity and 15% in natural gas.\n\nDemocrat McKee contends the law - passed in the wake of severe gasoline shortages in the 1970's - applies to disruptions in energy supply only, not prices.\n\nStanding next to Kalus outside the State House on Wednesday, Flanders - a one-time GOP candidate for the U.S. Senate - disagreed with McKee's reading of the law, and Kalus accused McKee of rejecting the idea solely because she came up with it.\n\nHe told a press conference; the law applies \"whenever there is an abnormal energy related market disruption...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nAt such times, Flanders contended: \"the governor can issue an executive order declaring the existence of an energy crisis...[that threatens] the welfare ore economic well-being if R.I. citizens.\"\n\nHe said the Russian-Ukrainian war \"has caused large increases in market prices for gas and electricity\" that have created the kind of \"abnormal market conditions.\" that allow the governor rescind any orders handed down by the Public Utilities Commission, and defer the approved rates hikes until \"a later date when prices moderate or decrease which they are expected to do in the not to distant future.\"\n\nThat is not certain.\n\nOne of the reasons: The PUC requires Rhode Island Energy to buy supplies far in advance of when they’re needed to smooth out any price fluctuations in wholesale energy markets.\n\nThat means much of the supply for this winter was procured before the war in Ukraine, which has driven up prices of natural gas, a critical fuel for electricity generation in New England.\n\nBut Flanders - who was often on the dissenting side on Supreme Court decisions during his time on the high court - cited the emergency actions taken by McKee and his predecessor, former Gov. Gina Raimondo, during the \"public health emergency\" created by the pandemic as precedent.\n\nThe McKee administration stance: \"The Energy Crisis Management Act was passed in response to the energy crises and fuel shortage(s) of the 1970s and was intended to help manage the supply of energy, not energy prices.\"\n\n\"If the statute were improperly invoked to attempt to address energy prices, it would expose Rhode Island taxpayers to expensive and protracted litigation.\"\n\nAsked about the potential for lawsuits, Flanders said: \"You can't do anything these days without somebody potentially challenging you. So no one could give you a guarantee that somebody wouldn't challenge you...but I don't think they would be successful.\".\n\nOCT. 12: GOP Kalus' name change on campaign filings draws complaint to state elections board\n\nA 79-year-old Warwick man has asked the Rhode Island Board of Elections to sort out the name of the Republican candidate for governor: Ashley Weinzweig, as she called herself when she filed her initial paperwork as a candidate, or Ashley Kalus.\n\nFor the record: Kalus amended her initial February 7 \"notice of organization\" on March 14, to reflect the name change on her candidacy papers from her husband's last name, Weinzweig, to Kalus..\n\nRichard Langseth framed his complaint to the elections board as an \"objection to Ashley Weinzweig's amended notice of organization.\"\n\nHe said he did so after trying to trace Kalus' history in Rhode Island and finding her Newport home and her business filings were all under the name Weinzweig.\n\nThere has been no response yet from the Board of Elections to the filing, which touches on an issue familiar to professional women who chose to use their maiden names in some settings and their married names in others.\n\nOCT. 12: Magaziner pollster says Dem trails Fung by just 3 points\n\nAfter the latest public poll showed Republican Allan Fung leading Democrat Seth Magaziner by 8 points, a polling memo released by Magaziner's pollster Wednesday showed the gap a more manageable 3 points.\n\nThe polling memo from the Mellman Group, firm founded by Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said the campaign's polling showed Fung with 43% of the vote, Magaziner 40%. Moderate Party Candidate William Gilbert with 5% and 12% undecided.\n\nThat would put Magaziner well within the 4.9% margin or error.\n\n\"With a month to go, undecideds are disproportionately likely to break for Magaziner, as there are four times as many undecided Democrats (54%) as Republicans (13%,) with a third (33%) independents,\" the memo said. \"With double digit undecideds four weeks out, this is a wide-open race.\"\n\nOCT. 7: State employees union endorses Democrats, except in treasurers race\n\nThe largest union for Rhode Island state workers, Council 94, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, endorsed Democrats on Friday for every statewide and federal office this year -- except general treasurer.\n\nThe union endorsed Republican James Lathrop, the finance director in North Kingstown, over Democrat James Diossa, the former mayor of Central Falls.\n\n\"Our decision was based on the fact that [Lathrop] is a CPA instead of a politician and wanted to just be treasurer, not use it as a stepping stone,\" Council 94 President J. Michael Downey said Friday. \"That was refreshing to us.\"\n\nDowney added that the union also had some reservations about Diossa's level of \"transparency\" around managing the Central Falls pension when he was mayor, and the temporary transfer of $500,000 out of the fund into municipal coffers. The transfer was raised as an issue by Diossa's opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\nAside from Lathrop, Council 94 endorsed almost entirely Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, including Dan McKee for governor, Sabina Matos for lieutenant governor, Peter Neronha for attorney general, Gregg Amore for secretary of state and David Cicilline and Seth Magaziner for Congress.\n\nIn General Assembly races, Council 94 endorsed former state Rep. Elizabeth Crowley, who is running as an independent, over Democratic incumbent Sen. Jonathon Acosta in Central Falls. And it endorsed Republican Anthony Deluca over Democrat Jennifer Rourke for Senate in Warwick.\n\nIn the House, the union endorsed independent Antonio Desimas over incumbent Democratic Rep. Brianna Henries of East Providence.\n\nOCT. 5: Magaziner goes after GOP on Social Security\n\nJOHNSTON -- Seth Magaziner Tuesday said if Republicans retake the House thanks to a victory by his opponent Allan Fung, they will try to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n\"The Republican agenda in Washington could not be more extreme on this issue,\" Magaziner told supporters at the Johnston Senior Center. \"Just this summer, the Republicans in Washington came out with something they called the Blueprint to Save America. That blueprint included raising the Social Security age. For most people that is already 67. How much longer do they want people to have to work?\"\n\nMagaziner's Johnston event was held to accept the endorsement from the National Committee to Protect Social Security and Medicare, a left-leaning group founded by the son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nCommittee to Protect Social Security PAC President Max Richtman said \"we've seen a lot of talk about sunsetting these programs.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound dangerous, but what it means is we start from scratch every five years,\" he said. \"Can you imagine that? Can you imagine how complicated it would be to recreate Social Security?\"\n\nIn television interviews, Fung has said Magaziner has \"distorted\" his position on Social Security which he said he does not want to cut.\n\nFung's campaign did not respond to Magaziner's comments Tuesday or questions about how he would fund Social Security and whether that could include raising the age when Americans can collect full Social Security benefits.\n\nAs evidence for the claim that Republicans would cut Social Security, Magaziner cited a plan that Rep. Kevin McCarthy worked on with former Speaker Paul Ryan a decade ago, which moved to privatize Social Security. McCarthy, who is expected to be speaker if the GOP retakes the House, has raised money and financed ads backing Fung in Rhode Island's second congressional district.\n\nThe Blueprint to Save America was released by the Republican Study Committee in June.\n\nAs for how he would shore up Social Security, Magaziner said he supports raising payroll taxes on people who make more than $400,000 per year. Currently earnings subject to the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are capped at $147,000 per year.\n\nSEPT. 27: McKee, Kalus at odds over need for special legislative session to suspend tax on electricity bills\n\nDays after Gov. Dan McKee promised to push legislation to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on electricity bills when lawmakers reconvene in January, his GOP opponent Ashley Kalus is asking: why wait?\n\nKalus renewed her earlier call for a special session to blunt the the impact of the big increase Rhode Islanders will see in their electric bills starting on Oct. 1, as a result of the approval last Friday, by state regulators, of the rate hike requested by the state’s largest energy company.\n\nHer Tweet: \"If @DanMcKeeRI cared about working families, seniors, & low-income Rhode Islanders, he would call the General Assembly in now for an emergency session to suspend the Gross Receipts Tax on electricity rather than wait until January.\"\n\nArticle IX of the state Constitution gives the governor the power to call the legislature - which closed up shop in June - back to the State House for an emergency legislative session.\n\nBut the governor and legislative leaders say it doesn't apply.\n\nWhen asked why Democrat McKee was not exercising this option, the governor's spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal: “The Governor’s legal counsel believes that the Governor currently does not have the authority to call the General Assembly back into session.”\n\nAsked to elaborate, he said: \" The Rhode Island General Assembly is not currently in adjournment. It has the power to come back into session at any time. We read the Governor’s constitutional power to convene a special session as applicable only when the General Assembly is in adjournment. \"\n\nIn their own joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said: “The Governor currently is not constitutionally empowered to convene the General Assembly.”\n\nThey did not explain the basis for their conclusion, though John Marion, executive director of the citizens' advocacy group Common Cause, suggested the Constitution may not apply in years, such as now, when the General Assembly has recessed, rather than adjourned. No court has ruled on this.\n\nA day earlier: Sheaff said the governor, nonetheless, \"continues to be committed to providing relief for all Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nHe said McKee advocated against the rate increase and redirected $3.8 million in Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative funds to \"direct rate relief\" for low-income customers.\n\nBeyond that, he said McKee is \"renewing his proposal to suspend the state’s 4% gross receipt tax on all electricity bills through the April 2023 utility billing period, which is the last month that winter electricity rates will be reflected in constituents’ utility bills.\"\n\n\"Additionally,\" Sheaff said, \"the governor proposed 2 relief tools that would apply to all ratepayers – both were approved by the PUC: 1) Suspending the customer charge on electric bills 2) Distributing $32 million in settlement credits with the Attorney General back to ratepayers.”\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212.\n\nAs a result, however, of moves taken so far, \"We have effectively eliminated the impact for our most vulnerable constituents, and they will not see an increase in their overall electric bills when compared to last winter,\" McKee said earlier.\n\nThe credit and the suspended customer charge will reduce the impact of the rate increase by about a third for most residential customers. Instead of paying an additional $312 over the winter period, the typical ratepayer will see an increase of about $212. .\"\n\nIt is unclear how much the suspension of the 4% gross receipts tax might shave off the new rates approved Friday by the state's Public Utilities Commission.\n\nAsked how much revenue the state would forgo, Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi told The Journal: \"The estimate we have is a revenue loss of around $42 million to $47 million for a six-month waiver of the gross receipts tax on electricity.\"\n\nKalus contends: \"Dan McKee wants to hold relief for Rhode Islanders hostage until after November.\"\n\nMcKee's campaign has not responded.\n\nKalus first raised the idea of a special session to suspend the gross receipts tax in a July 23 Tweet, soon after The Journal published a story about the rate hikes filed with state regulators by Rhode Island Energy.\n\nMcKee spokesman Matt Sheaff told The Journal Tuesday night that \"suspension of the gross receipts tax was one of the proposals that Governor McKee brought to legislative leaders during their weekly meetings to discuss potential ways to provide relief to Rhode Islanders with the surplus.\"\n\n\"At that time it was not clear exactly what the increase would be so it was decided that this proposal would be reviewed at the beginning of the [next] legislative session. \"\n\nLegislative spokesman Larry Berman said House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi recalls this coming up during their May meetings. He said: \"This will be addressed in January.\"\n\nSEPT. 21: Former Republicans stump for Magaziner\n\nClaudine Schneider, who was a Republican when she represented Rhode Island in Congress, was among five GOP defectors to endorse Democrat Seth Magaziner Wednesday.\n\n“The Republican Party of today is not the same Republican Party it was when I represented the Rhode Island second congressional district in the 1980s,\" Schneider said in a news release. \"The GOP in Washington has become the party of insurrectionist Donald Trump, and it is directly at odds with the values of Rhode Islanders.\"\n\nSchneider, the first woman to represent Rhode Island in Congress, currently lives in Colorado.\n\nThe other former Republicans to endorse Magaziner were Republican State Sen. Dawson Hodgson, former State Rep. Robert Nardolillo, Cranston Councilman Robert Ferri, and former gubernatorial candidate Vincent Marzullo.\n\nHodgson will support Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House, and this is unacceptable,\" Hodgson said. \"McCarthy voted to overturn the 2020 election, in direct opposition to the Constitution that we all hold dear.\"\n\nSEPT. 20: Warwick Democrat delivers Chamber endorsement to GOP's Fung\n\nWARWICK -- He may be a Democrat, but in his day job Warwick City Council President Stephen McAllister is a regional vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnd the U.S. Chamber, unlike some local chambers, leans to the right.\n\nSo in a week of post-primary Democratic unity, it was McAllister who joined Republican Allan Fung to deliver the Chamber's endorsement of the former Cranston mayor, who is trying to flip Rhode Island's second congressional district to the GOP.\n\n\"Our number one goal is to send people like Allan to Washington D.C. that want to roll up their sleeves and get to work,\" McAllister said Tuesday sitting next to Fung. \"Big things can happen when Congress gets together, negotiates and moves things forward.\"\n\nThe big things McAllister had in mind were the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by Congress last year and the \"CHIPS Act\" to boost the semi-conductor industry, which passed earlier this year.\n\nFung says he supported both bills, which were passed by a Democratic Congress and opposed by House GOP leadership, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy raised money for Fung and controls a PAC running negative ads against Democratic nominee Seth Magaziner. (The CHIPS Act was spearheaded by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has defeated Fung in the last two Rhode Island gubernatorial elections.)\n\nMcAllister declined to commit to voting for Fung personally in November, but said he supports the Chamber's political agenda.\n\nFung accepted the Chamber endorsement at Brewed Awakenings on Bald Hill Road, across the street from GOP governor nominee Ashley Kalus' campaign headquarters.\n\nAnd he took the opportunity to hammer away increases in the cost of living over the past year under Democratic control of Washington, his top campaign issue.\n\n\"Coming to Washington D.C. hopefully in January I want to bring common sense solutions, making sure we are focused on the right things to get our economy going, cut a lot of this crazy spending and drive down inflation.\" Fung said.\n\nHe did not provide any new details of what policies, if elected, he would pursue to reduce inflation, beyond cutting \"wasteful spending.\"\n\nAsked what spending should be cut, Fung mentioned the Presidio tunnel project in San Francisco he blasted at his campaign announcement in April and said last year's American Rescue Plan provided too much money to states. But he doesn't want try to claw that money back from state coffers.\n\nLike government spending, tax cuts are also inflationary, and Fung says he would not rule out voting for tax cuts if the GOP retakes Congress.\n\n\"I am going to take a look at everything that will help, not just business owners, but residents in general,\" Fung said. \"If that means tax cuts that benefits all walks of life, sure I will take a look at it.\"\n\nHe did not answer when asked what he thinks of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flying migrants to New England, a topic that has dominated national news coverage this week.\n\nMagaziner responded to the U.S. Chamber endorsement by saying he would stand with workers instead of corporations.\n\n“Allan Fung is showing his true colors yet again, standing with billion-dollar corporate lobbyists who oppose the Affordable Care Act and any efforts to crack down on the price gouging that is hurting Rhode Islanders at the gas pump,\" Magaziner said in an email. \"Tonight, I will proudly accept the support of the AFL-CIO which represents 80,000 workers across the state of Rhode Island. In Congress, I will stand with working Rhode Islanders, while Allan Fung stands with the corporate lobbyists.”\n\nSEPT. 19: Congressional delegation endorses Magaziner\n\nRhode Island's all-Democratic congressional delegation Monday joined the party's post-primary effort to unify behind Seth Magaziner in the race against Republican Allan Fung.\n\nIn Johnston, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. David Cicilline and Jim Langevin were joined by Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena and the Democrats Magaziner beat in the primary to stump for him.\n\n“Seth has served the second congressional district for the last eight years, fixing crumbling school buildings and creating clean energy jobs from Westerly to Burrillville,\" Langevin, whose decision not to run for reelection set off the battle for the Second District seat.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, who part of the House Democratic leadership team, was more more blunt.\n\n\"Allan Fung will be a vote for the national Republicans dead set on passing a national abortion ban, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors rely on,\" Cicilline said. \"In the House, the majority party controls the agenda and decides which bills see the light of day.\"\n\nReed said \"a vote to send Allan Fung to Congress is a vote to empower Trump Republicans and tighten Trump's chokehold on our democracy.”\n\nThe congressional delegation event comes after the state party on Sunday night held a unity dinner in Warwick to bring statewide candidates together after the primary including the candidates for governor.\n\nAnd it comes as the national GOP targets Rhode Island's Second District as one of its top potential pickup targets as it tries to win back a majority in the House.\n\nA Super PAC controlled by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who visited Rhode Island to raise money for Fung this summer, spent $1 million on advertising in the district.\n\nA television spot from the Congressional Leadership Fund now airing in Rhode Island accuses Magaziner of using family money to \"buy his way into office.\"\n\nSEPT. 12: Former RI Health Director Alexander-Scott endorses Foulkes for governor\n\nA day ahead of Tuesday's five-way Democratic primary, former Rhode Island Health Director Nicole Alexander-Scott endorsed former CVS executive Helena Foulkes for governor over the incumbent, Dan McKee.\n\nIn a statement explaining why she is backing Foulkes over McKee, who was her boss until she gave two-weeks notice that she was leaving in January, Alexander-Scott said:\n\n\"For Rhode Island to be best equipped to handle the next crisis, the state cannot stay with the status quo. Early on, I saw how critical it was to have a Governor with vision, integrity, a listening ear, and a willingness to be accountable.\n\n\"Rhode Island needs change and needs new leadership. Helena Foulkes is the leader Rhode Island needs.\"\n\nThis was the response from the McKee campaign: \"Helena Foulkes is trying to change the conversation away from her role in fueling the opioid crisis and the nearly billion dollars in settlements that CVS now has to pay because of her negligent 'leadership'.\"\n\nIn February 2021, before McKee took office, \"Rhode Island received an F from Harvard on its vaccination rollout. Rhode Island was in the bottom 10 states nationwide per capita for deaths. The NY Times had Rhode Island dead last for share of its population that has received at least one vaccine dose and percentage of doses used.\n\n\"Governor McKee’s leadership changed that,\" campaign spokeswoman Alana O'Hare said. \"He partnered with municipalities and prioritized teachers to get shots off the shelves and into arms, and our state is now the most vaccinated in the nation.\"\n\n\"Gov. McKee’s record speaks for itself,\" she said.\n\nBut Alexander-Scott's deputy, Tom McCarthy, who resigned shortly after she did, pushed back with this Tweet:\n\n\"Unreal, it was a challenge to get the Governor to listen to and understand the FACTS let alone make a decision. It was easier to prop up a “whacky, waving inflatable arm” blow up at a car dealership than stiffen his spine to make a real decision.\"\n\nAlexander-Scott, who was hired by then-Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2015, never publicly explained why she quit before the end of her appointed term. She was given a $46,000 a month consulting gig - described as a \"transition services agreement\" - that ran from March 1 through May 31.\n\nMcKee's rivals in the race for governor blamed him for the departure, with one saying it \"signals a lack of confidence in [McKee's] leadership and handling of COVID-19.\"\n\nBut others in state government, including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, said Alexander-Scott had privately told them that \"she's given all that she can to the job\" and she's just ready to move on.\n\nAnd McKee said at the time he regretted her leaving: “Her leadership has been crucial to our whole of government response — helping Rhode Island become number one in testing nationwide and getting more people vaccinated per capita than nearly any other state in the country,\" he said in a statement issued by his office.\n\nThere has been no response yet from McKee to Alexander-Scott's political shot at him and his administration.\n\nIn her statement, released by the Foulkes campaign, she said: \"Please do not let Tuesday pass without doing your part to ensure that Rhode Island has a leader who is ready to tackle the challenges lying ahead in education, housing, employment, and so many other areas.\n\nIn July, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials announced that Alexander-Scott had been hired as a \"senior executive consultant...[to] lead the creation of a national office that will serve as a resource hub for state, territorial, county, and local governments and public health agencies to effectively invest in communities using evidence-informed, place-based, community-led interventions.\"\n\nSEPT. 9: Elorza calls for removal of ExpressVote machines ahead of primary\n\nOn Friday, Mayor Jorge Elorza called for the ExpressVote machines to be removed ahead of the primary, putting the request in writing to Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and the Board of Elections.\n\n“I just have very little faith that everything is going to be ready to go by Election Day, and so I think it’s prudent at this time to just pull these ExpressVote machines and get everything ready for the general election,” Elorza said.\n\nThe mayor said existing machines, which are not the ExpressVote machines, “are more than enough to handle the volume of voters” in the primary, calling the ExpressVote machines unnecessary.\n\nVarious errors have been uncovered on Spanish language ballots shown on the machines, including the erroneous lists of candidates. Lists from the 2018 cycle were shown on some ballots, which included Elorza’s name. He is term-limited and not remain in office next year.\n\nElorza said he isn’t sure whether the Board of Elections has formally adopted a verification process, calling it a concern.\n\nThis comes after Elorza exchanged letters over the issue with Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, who is running for governor. Elorza has endorsed her opponent, Helena Foulkes.\n\nIn his letter, Elorza appeared to hold Gorbea responsible for the fiasco, along with the Board of Elections.\n\nIn her letter, Gorbea said responsibility lies with the Board of Elections, adding that she trusts Elorza’s statements were not made because of his endorsement of Foulkes.\n\n“That was upsetting,” Elorza said of Gorbea’s remarks. “I mean, come on. This has been a string of issues that continue to come out day after day after day, and it’s incumbent upon them. What I’m asking them to do is to ensure that we have a fair and accurate election.”\n\nIn a subsequent statement, Gorbea's campaign manager Dana Walton made an even stronger comment than the candidate herself had made, describing Elorza's press conference as a \"political stunt days before an election to help out Mayor Elorza’s endorsed candidate.\" Walton added that the Board of Elections held a public meeting on Wednesday when Elorza could have noted his concerns.\n\nIn a letter after his announcement, the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause Rhode Island released a statement demanding Elorza retract his call for the removal of the machines, stating it would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\"Voters with disabilities have a right to use a machine that can assist them voting their ballot, and the ExpressVote is that machine,\" said RIACLU Director Steven Brown.\n\nElorza said he asked the Secretary of State and Board of Elections \"whether these are the only ADA accessible machines\" and if so, to ensure people with disabilities have the option not to use them. The mayor says he hopes there's already a backup plan.\n\nSEPT. 1: Teachers union endorses LaFortune for Providence mayor\n\nThe Providence Teachers Union on Thursday endorsed Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune for mayor, pointing to her city experience and background as a public school graduate.\n\n\"Nirva’s impressive qualifications, her unique connection with our schools and her commonsense ideas to take our public schools to the next level after the state takeover ends, make her the clear choice for mayor,\" the union said.\n\nThe endorsement comes just after LaFortune released a plan to become what she called \"Providence's education mayor.\" LaFortune aims to end the state's takeover of public schools, establish a teacher residency program, and fix up and construct new school buildings, among a host of other initiatives.\n\nThe union said LaFortune would serve as \"a partner at City Hall, instead of an adversary.\"\n\nOther union endorsements in the race include Gonzalo Cuervo's firefighters union endorsement and Brett Smiley's painters union endorsement.\n\nAUG. 24: Two governor candidates added to Nov. ballot\n\nThe Rhode Island Board of Elections Wednesday added two candidates for governor -- libertarian Elijah Gizzarelli and independent Paul Rianna Jr. -- to the November general election ballot.\n\nThe BOE had previously ruled Gizzarelli was 14 nomination signatures short of the 1,000 needed to get on the ballot ,and Rianna 42 signatures short.\n\nBut the Board restored dozens of signatures for the candidates that local boards of canvassers had rejected, giving them enough to qualify for the ballot.\n\nGizzarelli and Rianna wil join the winners of the September 13 Democratic and Republican primaries on the November ballot and independent Zachary Hurwitz.\n\nAUG. 24: NRA gives few endorsements, many F's to RI candidates\n\nThe National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund has endorsed five Rhode Island House candidates in its 2022 report card for the upcoming elections and dished out \"F\" grades to General Assembly leaders after they passed a ban on high capacity magazines this year.\n\nThe new NRA grades include an \"F\" for formerly \"A\" rates Senate president Dominick Ruggerio, a gun owner and Second Amendment advocate in the past.\n\nOut of dozens of competitive races and hundreds of candidates the gun rights group endorsed:Republican Rep. Barbara Ann Fenton-Fung of Cranston, Democratic Rep. Camille Vella-Winkinson of Warwick, Rep. Edward Cardillo of Johnston, Rep. Robert Phillips of Woonsocket and Democratic House challenger Natalya Delsanto of Cranston. Delsanto is challenging Rep. Brandon Potter, whom the NRA gave an \"F.\"\n\nThe NRA made no endorsements in any of the statewide races, including the governor's race. It gave Democratic candidates Gov. Dan McKee, Helena Foulkes and Nellie Gorbea \"F\" grades. Matt Brown and Luis Daniel Muñoz received a \"?\" grade.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus also received a \"?.\" Her primary opponent got a \"B,\" but no endorsement.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Democrats Sabina Matos, Cynthia Mendes and Deborah Ruggiero all got \"Fs\"\n\nAlong with Ruggerio, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi also received a \"F.\"\n\nReps. Charlene Lima, D-Cranston; Joseph Solomon, D-Warwick and Arthur Corvese, D-North Providence, received \"Bs.\"\n\nSens. Frank Ciccone, D-Providence; Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston and Frank Lombardo, D-Johnston, also got \"Bs\" from the NRA.\n\nAUG. 10: Matos hits Ruggiero over matching funds\n\nSparring in the lieutenant governor's race escalated Wednesday when Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos -- needled earlier in the week for debate ducking -- accused Democratic primary opponent Deborah Ruggiero of improperly seeking public campaign funding.\n\nThe complaint sent to the state Board of Elections from Matos campaign manager Evan England said Ruggiero had exceeded the amount of money a candidate can loan their campaign and receive state matching funds.\n\nThe state matching fund program limits how much candidates can spend while claiming public dollars and how much of that money -- 5% -- can come from personal funds. The Matos complaint calculates the limit for personal loans in a lieutenant governor race this year to be $43,233.\n\nIn March, Ruggiero loaned her campaign $15,000, which would not exceed the limit, but she had nearly $42,000 in her campaign account from her time as a state representative. Carrying those existing campaign funds over into the lieutenant governor campaign counts as a loan that would bring her total to around $57,000, the complaint alleges.\n\n\"When Rep. Ruggiero applied for taxpayer funds for her campaign, she agreed to follow certain rules,\" Matos campaign consultant Mike Raia wrote in an email. \"It's clear she has violated those rules.\"\n\nRuggiero spokesman Joe Caiazzo Wednesday night said the issue has been resolved.\n\nHe forwarded an email sent from Board of Elections Campaign Finance Director Richard Thornton to Ruggiero three hours after the Matos complaint was filed directing her to \"repay yourself for the loan made to the campaign to the extent necessary to comply with the [matching funds] pledge.\"\n\nAssuming the money, which comes out to around $14,000, is refunded, the letter from Thornton does not suggest Ruggiero will have any issue receiving matching funds.\n\nCaiazzo said Ruggiero will comply.\n\n\"This is another attempt by the Matos campaign to divert from the issues that actually matter to Rhode Islanders,\" Caiazzo wrote in an email. \"It is unfortunate she will not engage in dialogue and participate in debates.\"\n\nThe campaign finance complaint comes after Ruggiero attacked Matos earlier in the week for refusing to participate in more than one debate this year.\n\nRuggiero and fellow lieutenant governor candidate Sen. Cynthia Mendes taped a debate at WPRO-radio Tuesday that Matos declined to attend over a scheduling conflict.\n\n\"It is disappointing to see Sabina Matos and her team ignore our calls for debate participation,\" Ruggiero said in a news release Monday. \"Their previous remarks are dismissive and demeaning to all Rhode Islanders.\n\nMatos enjoys a healthy financial advantage in the race with $316,000 in her campaign account as of June 30 compared to $140,000 for Ruggiero. Matos is not seeking public matching funds in the race.\n\nMendes is also running in the Democratic primary and is seeking matching funds.\n\nAUG. 9: Seth Magaziner moves to second congressional district\n\nSeven months after launching his campaign for Congress, Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner has moved to the Second Congressional District he hopes to represent, his campaign said Tuesday.\n\nMagaziner moved from the East Side of Providence to Cranston's Edgewood neighborhood, campaign spokeswoman Patricia Socarras said.\n\nMagaziner will be renting a townhouse on Norwood Avenue on a block that dead-ends at Roger Williams Park. The move was first reported by the Boston Globe.\n\nThe move allowed Magaziner to register in the Second District so he can vote for himself ahead of the voter registration deadline.\n\nMagaziner grew up in the East Bay, which is in the First District, and some of Magaziner's election opponents have attacked him for not being from the district he wants to represent.\n\nSocarras said Magaziner plans to put his East Side home on the market to sell, but it has not been listed yet.\n\nAUG. 6: McCarthy visits Fung in RI\n\nKevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in Rhode Island Saturday to meet and presumably raise money for second congressional district candidate Allan Fung.\n\n\"Great day with a great candidate. Let’s turn #RI02 red @AllanFungRI,\" McCarthy, of California, tweeted around 4 p.m. with a photo of himself and Fung, dressed in nearly matching white shirts, khaki pants and navy blue blazers, standing on a manicured lawn overlooking Narragansett Bay.\n\nThe Fung campaign has not responded to questions about McCarthy's visit or where the anticipated fundraising event was held.\n\nThe Democrats hoping to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in Washington next year, however, blasted the alliance.\n\n“MAGA Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy supports privatizing Social Security, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and passing a national abortion ban, \" Patricia Socarras, spokeswoman for Seth Magaziner wrote in an email. \"The fact McCarthy is campaigning for Allan Fung in RI confirms what we already knew— Fung and the extremists Republicans would be a disaster for Rhode Island seniors, Rhode Islander workers and Rhode Island women.”\n\nBryan McNamara, spokesman for Sarah Morgenthau, wrote that Fung is “rolling out the red carpet for Kevin McCarthy and his radical far-right agenda, proving once again he is out-of-touch with the voters of the Second District.”\n\nJames Singer, regional press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tweeted: \"Can make a promise: Democrats will make sure voters see this photo again and again #ri02.\"\n\nAUG. 1: Gorbea says she's still the frontrunner, according to her polster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea's says a new poll she commissioned shows her leading the race for governor by five percentage points.\n\nIn a poll of likely Democratic primary conducted last week, 27% of respondents prefered Gorbea compared to 22% for Dan McKee, 14% for Helena Buonanno Foulkes, 7% for Matt Brown and 3% for Luis Daniel Muñoz, according to a polling memo from Gorbea pollster Celinda Lake. The Gorbea campaign did not release the full poll including what questions were asked.\n\nAccording to the Lake polling memo, 53% of likely voters view Gorbea favorably, compared to 49% who view McKee favorably and 33% who view Foulkes favorably.\n\nThe last public poll of the Democratic primary, done in late June, showed Gorbea at 24%, McKee 20% and Foulkes 16%.\n\nThe last time Gorbea released select results of a poll was in April and showed her with 30% of the vote, compared to 24% for McKee, 10% for Brown and 7% for Foulkes.\n\nIn her polling memo Lake emphasized Gorbea's lead over Foulkes who, while still trailing, in most recent polls has been gaining ground.\n\n\"Despite Foulkes heavy spending on television advertising, she is a distant third,\" Lake wrote.\n\nLate last week Foulkes announced a set of prominent endorsements including Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza.\n\nThe polling memo shows a large chunk of the electorate -- 22% -- remains undecided on who they would support for governor.\n\nJULY 25: AFL-CIO and state's largest teachers' union endorse McKee\n\nGov. Dan McKee on Monday continued to rack up support from organized labor with the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and National Education Association Rhode Island teachers' union endorsing him.\n\nGeorge Nee, president of Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said since McKee assumed the governorship in March, 2021, he has signed labor-friendly bills that raise the minimum wage, require greenhouse gas emission reductions, set minimum staffing levels at nursing homes and require state-backed construction projects to pay a prevailing wage.\n\n\"Gov. McKee has consistently demonstrated a commitment to making life better for working Rhode Islanders,\" Nee said in a news release. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the McKee Administration on issues that affect not only the 80,000 men and women of the Rhode Island labor movement but all of the Ocean State’s working people.”\n\nThe NEARI endorsement was perhaps more of a surprise and comes despite McKee's long-standing support for charter schools, which has put him at odds with the union over the years. Last year McKee helped block a union-backed moratorium on new charter schools in Rhode Island.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, McKee pushed to have teachers vaccinated for COVID-19 before the general public at a point in the pandemic when doses were scarce.\n\nSeeing organized labor line up behind the incumbent in a Democratic primary is not a surprise, especially in this election year where state governments across the country have had the opportunity to dole out billions of dollars in federal COVID aid.\n\n“Governor McKee put his money where his mouth is by ensuring funding for public school construction and even finally paying off an old debt owed by the state to the pension system,” NEARI President Larry Purtill said in a news release. “There have been, and still are, areas where we disagree with the Governor and frankly, all his rivals. However, communication with the McKee Administration has steadily become more active and robust as he accrues time in the role of governor.”\n\nThe release also credited McKee with responding to \"issues at the Community College of Rhode Island, by placing Purtill on the Council on Postsecondary Education.\n\nThe 12,000-member NEARI is the largest teachers' union in the state.\n\nJULY 20: McKee wins UNAP endorsement\n\nGov. Dan McKee has won the endorsement of the United Nurses and Allied Professionals.\n\nIn making the announcement on Wednesday, UNAP - which describes itself as Rhode Island's largest health care workers' union with more than 5,500 members - thanked McKee for steering millions in federal Coronavirus relief dollars towards health care workers and hospitals.\n\n“In less than a year and a half, Governor McKee has delivered big results for health care workers,” said Lynn Blais, President of the UNAP, in a statement released by the union.\n\n“He kept us and our patients safe during the worst of COVID by mandating the vaccine for health care workers. He’s made workplace development in the health care field a top priority, with a focus on alleviating hospital staffing issues, which have plagued us for years.\n\nAnd \"he worked with General Assembly leaders to deliver real financial relief in the form of ARPA funding and increased Medicaid reimbursements for our hospitals, keeping them out of the hands of the for-profit vultures looking to make a profit at the expense of health care workers and patients.\n\nThe union also credited him for the \"major investments'' in the new state budget for the state-run Eleanor Slater Hospital, including \"money for a new medical facility, upgrades to existing buildings and the development of a long-awaited electronic medical records system.”\n\nMcKee also presided over the award of recrutiment and mentoring bonuses -ranging from $500 to $10,000 - on top of the $3,000 bonsues given other state employees - fornew nurses and certified nursing assistants at the Slater Hospital, the Rhode Island Veterans Home and the medical wing of the state prison.\n\nIn her statement, Blais said: McKee \" has earned our endorsement through his actions to help not just nurses and health professionals, but the entire health care community in Rhode Island, and we look forward to supporting him in the Democratic Primary and beyond.”\n\nJULY 17: Magaziner leads congressional fundraising\n\nSeth Magaziner continues to raise more money than any other candidate seeking to replace the retiring Jim Langevin representing Rhode Island's Second Congressional District, according to the latest quarterly filings with the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nDemocrat Magaziner had $1.7 million in his campaign account at the end of June. So far this year he has raised $2.1 million and spent $400,000.\n\nMagaziner's donors are a who's who of Rhode Island industry and political influencers. They include former Fleet bank chief Terrence Murray, former IGT chairman Donald Sweitzer, former congressman Patrick Kennedy, Cornish Associates founder Arnold \"Buff\" Chace, Rhode Island Convention Center Chairman Bernie Buonanno Jr. and state Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin.\n\nHe also collected donations from political action committees representing unions such as Unite Here, International Union of Operating, Engineers, United Food and Commercial Workers, Plumbers and Pipefitters and the Laborers International Union.\n\nRepublican Allan Fung had second largest campaign warchest at the end of the second quarter, with $762,000. Fung has raised $857,000 so far this year, loaned his campaign $50,000 and spent $145,000.\n\nFung's donors include Carlos Trujillo, a Federalist Society contributor who was U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States under President Donald Trump. Fung also received $5,000 from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers PAC and $14,000 from members of the Tasca family that own auto dealerships.\n\nDemocrat Sarah Morgenthau had $621,000 in the bank. She has raised $692,000 so far this year, loaned her campaign $200,000 and spent $271,000.\n\nShe received $5,000 from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Off the Sidelines PAC and $1,000 from California Congressman Adam Schiff’s Frontline USA PAC.\n\nMost of her support came from out of state with only around two dozen individual donors from Rhode Island.\n\nDemocrat David Segal had $325,000 in the bank. He has raised $404,000, loaned his campaign $65,000 and spent $144,000 so far this year.\n\nLike Morgenthau. Segal also received most of his from out of state.\n\nHis Rhode Island donors included State Rep. John Lombardi and Providence City Council member Rachel Miller.\n\nDemocrat Joy Fox had $173,000 in the bank. She raised $281,000 and spent $108,000 so far this year.\n\nSome of her notable Rhodedonors included former lieutenant governor Elizabeth Roberts, former state Department of Human Services Director Courtney Hawkins and former candidate for governor Myrth York.\n\nNo second quarter campaign finance report was posted on the FEC website for Democrat Omar Bah as of Sunday.\n\nJULY 11: Morgenthau gets Booker endorsement\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker endorsed Sarah Morgenthau for Congress on Monday as the Democrats running for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat continue to tout support from prominent Washington lawmakers.\n\nMorgenthau, who quit a job in the Biden administration to run for Congress, worked on Booker's successful 2006 campaign for mayor of Newark.\n\n\"I have known Sarah for years. She had faith in me at a time few others did, and came to work for my mayoral campaign in Newark, which was no easy thing,” Booker said in a news release. “I am asking the voters of Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District to have the same faith in Sarah Morgenthau that she had in me. Sarah is hardworking, compassionate, and knows how to get things done in Washington.\"\n\nMorgenthau's Booker endorsement comes after Treasurer Seth Magaziner two weeks ago announced the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who holds the seat the candidates are trying to fill.\n\nMagaziner also received an endorsement from Massachusetts 4rth District Congressman Jake Auchincloss last week.\n\nBack in April, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren endorsed David Segal for Rhode Island's 2nd District and held an online fundraiser for him at the end of last month.\n\nJULY 8: Construction unions hit the air for McKee\n\nUnlike his Democratic primary rivals, Gov. Dan McKee hasn't done any campaign advertising so far this year and thanks to local building trades unions may not need to very soon.\n\nThe Rhode Island Building Trades Council on Friday launched television ads backing McKee Friday and thanking him for recent rounds of state spending programs.\n\n\"Since taking office, Gov. Dan McKee has delivered an historic investment in much-needed affordable housing. He's taken the lead on historic school construction projects,\" the ad said. \"So while some candidates have talked a good game, Dan McKee has delivered historic results.\"\n\nHaving the unions run independent ads backing you shows the power of incumbency and the political advantages of being in control of a $13 billion state budget.\n\nMichael Sabitoni, president of the Building Trades Council, said Friday that the unions' support for McKee was a result of what he has delivered for them since taking office last year.\n\n\"At the end of the day he gets an 'A' from us since he has been in office,\" Sabitoni said. \"Everything he has done with Covid, everything he has done with the state employees.\"\n\n\"All the other people say they are going to do this, they are going to do that. He has already done it,\" he added. \"There is only one person who has submitted a budget and had the General Assembly pass a budget.\"\n\nSaboitoni said the current ad will run \"two or three weeks\" and that there would be another ad coming focusing on infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Board of Elections, the Building Trades Council spent $100,000 placing the ad with the television networks and cable.\n\nEarlier this week Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea's campaign released a new ad describing her housing plan.\n\nAnd she announced the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 328.\n\nJUNE 24-26: House speaker, Senate president endorse McKee in crowded race for governor\n\nAhead of the state Democratic Party's endorsement convention on Sunday night, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio have gone public with their choice in the crowded race for governor: Dan McKee, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Ruggerio issued a statement, announcing his endorsement of McKee for Governor and Sabina Matos for Lieutenant Governor.\n\nIn his statement, Ruggerio said, McKee and Matos, his appointed successor as lieutenant governor, \"have been effective partners with the Senate over the past year and a half, and they have helped to deliver results that will benefit the people and small businesses of our state now and into the future.\"\n\n“Dan McKee was thrust into the Governor’s office during a difficult time, amid a pandemic, and he rose to meet the challenge,\" RUggerio said.\n\n\"We worked collaboratively to ensure Rhode Islanders struggling under the weight of inflation saw immediate, tangible relief by eliminating the car tax, providing child tax credits, expanding low-income property tax breaks, and much more.\n\n\"Governor McKee is attuned to the challenges facing small businesses in Rhode Island, and he has succeeded in addressing many of these challenges, taking action to mitigate the worker shortage, improve workforce training, and reduce taxes,\" he said.\n\n“Lieutenant Governor Matos has provided indispensable leadership throughout her time in the lieutenant governor’s office,\" he added, citing several examples. Among them: \"Her work on housing, which has been a primary focus, has helped our state make historic progress.\"\n\nOn Friday, on the day after the close of the six-month legislative session – and round after round of negotiations with McKee's team, Shekarchi publicly endorsed McKee for election to the job to which he ascended in March 2021 after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post.\n\n“I appreciate his leadership and ability to collaborate with the legislature on such key issues as the landmark Act on Climate bill to protect our precious environment, as well as making key investments in education, health care and assisting our small businesses,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"We have an excellent working relationship which resulted in a great budget for all Rhode Islanders this year,\" added Shekarchi, citing the elimination of the car tax a year ahead of schedule, expanded tax credits for seniors and disabled people, and a tax credit for working families with children.\n\n“The Governor and I [also] share the mutual goal of increasing affordable housing opportunities for all Rhode Islanders, which is evident by the $250 million in housing investments contained in the budget, and we worked together on a comprehensive package of new housing bills.\"\n\nShekarchi will not have a direct vote on the endorsements the Democratic State Committee will hand out on Sunday night. But the speaker traditionally has had significant sway as the chosen leader of the Democrat-dominated House of representatives.\n\nThe explanation lies in the math: The committee's voting members include a state committeeman and a state committeewoman from each of the 75 House Districts, which equates to 150 of the 250 voting members.\n\nMcKee is facing four Democratic challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and health-care advocate Luis Daniel Muñoz.\n\nWinning the endorsement will require more than 50% of those voting.\n\nOn Saturday, Shekarchi also endorsed current state Treasurer Seth Magaziner for R.I.'s 2nd Congressional District seat.\n\n\"I am strongly supporting Seth Magaziner to fight against the radical views in Washington that are clearly out of step with Rhode Islanders,\" Shekarchi said.\n\n\"Having worked well with Seth as our General Treasurer for the past eight years, I can attest to his intelligence, character and strength that will serve us so well in Congress. We need Seth to join with Senator [Jack] Reed, Senator [Sheldon] Whitehouse and Congressman [David] Cicilline to carry forth the Democratic values that are so critical to our future as a state and a nation.\"\n\nThe Speaker has not [yet] weighed in on the primary race between Democrats Stefan Pryor and James Diossa to succeed Magaziner as treasurer.\n\nBut Pryor, who was until this past Tuesday the state's commerce secretary, won an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building & Construction Trades Council, a coalition of 16 local trade unions .\n\n“I have seen first hand Stefan Pryor’s work creating economic development. He created thousands of local union construction jobs, and his record is second to none. He is running a serious campaign on issues impacting all of Rhode Island and his record demonstrates that he is the type of leader we need as General Treasurer,” said Building Trades President Michael F. Sabitoni.\n\nJUNE 20: Senate Judiciary Chair Coyne not seeking reelection\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairwoman Cynthia Coyne is not seeking reelection to the Senate District 32 seat — representing all of Barrington and portions of B​ristol and East Providence — that she first won in 2014..\n\nWith the start of the candidate declaration period now only days away, Democrat Coyne — one of the highest ranked women in the R.I. Senate — issued this statement:\n\n“I have decided that the time is right to retire from the Senate, but I am not retiring from public service.\"\n\n\"In the immediate future, I look forward to spending more quality time with family and friends. I don’t know what my future may hold after that, but I know that I will always be engaged and eager to serve the community in some capacity.\"\n\nWithin hours of Coyne's announcement, Barrington Democratic Town Committee Chair Pam Lauria announced her candidacy for Coyne's seat.\n\nShe is a primary care nurse practitioner at Coastal Medical, now serving as a Trustee on Coastal’s Board. She is a volunteer and advocate with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and a member of Barrington’s Housing Board of Trustees, \"working to increase affordable housing in Barrington.\" She has led the Barrington Democratic Town Committee since 2017,\n\nShe listed, as her priorities: \"Affordable/equitable/accessible healthcare, commonsense laws to reduce gun violence, affordable housing, supporting children educationally and emotionally, and making RI affordable for all.\"\n\nCoyne is a former state trooper who retired at the rank of lieutenant in 2006, and a graduate of the FBI National Academy.,\n\nIn her first term, \"she worked to enact legislation to protect domestic violence victims by removing firearms from felony abusers... In more recent years, she championed new laws prohibiting untraceable ghost guns and 3-D printed guns.\"\n\nShe was also the lead Senate sponsor of legislation to limit firearm magazine capacity to 10 rounds of ammunition that won General Assembly approval last week after an initial tie vote in her committee that would have doomed it, has Senate leaders not vailed themselves of a rule allowing \"immediate consideration:\" of the House-passed version.\n\nThe legislation is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee this week.\n\nOn Monday, Coyne also pointed with pride to her sponsorship of legislation requiring public reporting on all child deaths or near fatalities, background checks for people working or volunteering with children and reforms to the state’s human trafficking laws.\n\nOther bills she sponsored — or co-sponsored — increased the age to purchase tobacco in Rhode Island to 21, and opened the door to compensation to individuals who were wrongfully convicted.\n\nFirst elected to the Senate in 2014, she previously served as a member of the Barrington Town Council.\n\n“The issues that come before the Judiciary Committee are some of the most emotional and divisive issues to be considered by the Senate,\" Coyne said Monday.\n\n\"I tried to find common ground and start from a place of respect to build consensus whenever we could. We were able to get a lot accomplished, and I am appreciative of everyone I have had the opportunity to work with over the years.”\n\nJUNE 17: Candidates opt in, out of contest for Democratic Party endorsements\n\nA noon deadline has now come and gone for candidates for top state and federal office to signal whether or not they want the state Democratic Party endorsement.\n\nAnd, no surprise - most do - including Gov. Dan McKee and his challengers: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown, former CVS executive Helena Foulkes and .health care activist Luis Daniel Munoz.\n\nUnder new party rules, they not only had to declare their candidacies by noon Friday for the endorsements that will be voted on June 26, they had to name the individuals who will be nominating them and seconding their nominations.\n\nFor example, McKee is counting on North Providence Mayor Charlie Lombardi and Sen. Ana Quezada to put his name in the hat. Gorbea named Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera and party activist Ann Gooding.\n\nFoulkes named Sen. Louis DiPalma and David Chenevert, the lohg-time executive director of the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association; Brown named Portsmouth Town Councilmember Linda Ujifusa and Aaron Pearson, and Munoz named Meg Cotter and Dwayne Keys.\n\nIf none of the candidates are able to muster more than 50% of the votes in three rounds of elimination voting, there will be no endorsement as has happened on occasion in the past, but would obviously not be a good look for a sitting governor.\n\nOnly two candidates in the crowded race for the 2nd District Congressioal seat that long-time Rep. Jim Langevin is vacating opted not to seek the endorsement: Joy Fox and Omar Bah.\n\nThe other Democrats seeking the seat all threw their names in, including state Treas. Seth Magaziner, former state Rep. David Segal, Rhode Island. political newcomer Sarah Morgenthau and Providence firefighter Cameron Moquin.\n\nIn the three-way race for lieutenant, incumbent Sabina Matos is seeking the nomination. So is state Sen. Cynthia Mendes of East Providence..\n\nBut the third Democrat in the lieutenant governor's race - state Rep. Deb Ruggiero - is not.\n\nRuggiero, D-Jamestown, explained her rationale in a letter to members of the state Democratic Committee that said, in part:.\n\n\"Like you, I'm a life-long Democrat. I believe in the values of our Party; equity, equality, and justice.\"\n\n\"As Democrats, we believe in small \"d\" democracy. We have faith in our citizens and believe the more people that participate the better the process. That is my message to the voters - if you believe in me and give me your vote, I will work tirelessly for you.\"\n\n\"For this reason, I have decided NOT to seek the endorsement of the Democratic Party in my race for Lt. Governor in hopes of not dividing our Party.\"\n\nIn her own letter to the party, Matos - who was chosen by Gov. Dan McKee as his replacement when he ascended from lieutenant governor to governor in March 2021, has made this case:\n\n\"In more than a decade as a city councilor in Providence and over the past year as Lieutenant Governor, I have had the opportunity to meet and work alongside many of you.\n\n\"I know the commitment required to keeping our Democratic values and priorities front and center,\" she wrote.\n\nBoth Democrats in the race for treasurer opted to seek the nomination: Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor and former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa.\n\nThere are 250 voting members of the State Democratic Committee.(An earlier version of the blog poist said 286 based on incorrect information initially provided by the party.)\n\nThe list inlcudes, but is not limitd to: the party chairs in every city and town, three appointees each by the House Speaker and the Senate president, the state's four-member Congressional delegation, the five general officers, the party's Democratic National Committeeman and woman, and the committeeman and women in each House district, according to party advisor Kate Coyne McCoy..\n\nJUNE 15: Diossa says Pryor should resign over soccer stadium\n\nCandidate for treasurer and Central Falls Mayor James Diossa on Wednesday called on Democratic rival and state Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor to resign from negotiating a Pawtucket soccer stadium deal.\n\nPryor announced his campaign for treasurer on May 24 with a plan to step down as commerce secretary in \"two weeks\" and hit the campaign trail.\n\nBut negotiations on a bailout plan for the \"Tidewater Landing\" soccer stadium project have gotten messy. The Commerce Corporation Board of Directors on Tuesday declined to vote on a new agreement Pryor struck with developer Fortuitous Partners.\n\nThe board's concern was that the new proposal would strip public funding from the housing, infrastructure and non-stadium elements of the project, raising the possibility the state will have to spend significantly more money down the road.\n\nBut Diossa, a supporter of the stadium, blames the board's concerns about the deal on Pryor keeping them \"in the dark until such a late stage.\"\n\n\"Multiple members of the Board were visibly bothered by the lack of ready answers from Commerce staff to the Board’s basic questions,\" Diossa said in a news release. \"Transparency is critical, and the intelligent, capable members of the Commerce Board deserve access to all the information and to have their questions answered so that they can do their due diligence.\"\n\nDiossa cited comments by board member Donna Sams in particular that she was \"frustrated\" at not getting sufficient answers from Pryor.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sams took issue with Diossa attacking Pryor in her name, saying in an email that she found his answers \"satisfactory and convincing\" and that she \"would never rush Stefan's departure.\"\n\nNevertheless, Diossa went on in the Wednesday news release, accusing Pryor of using the stadium for \"political gain,\" although it was not entirely clear how Pryor is benefitting from a deal now in serious risk of collapse.\n\n\"A now declared candidate for General Treasurer, Mr. Pryor pledged to leave office within two weeks,\" Diossa wrote. \"That time having passed, Mr. Pryor has recklessly clung to power in an attempt to influence the outcome of these negotiations for future political gain.\"\n\nDiossa's partner state Sen. Sandra Cano is Pawtucket's commerce director and is part of Mayor Donald Grebien's team pushing for more state help to rescue the stadium.\n\nGrebien has endorsed Diossa for state treasurer.\n\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment on Diossa's remarks.\n\nJUNE 8: New mayoral endorsements for Cuervo and LaFortune\n\nFormer Boston Mayor Kim Janey has endorsed Providence mayoral candidate and councilwoman Nirva LaFortune.\n\n\"I know that Councilwoman LaFortune is ready to meet the challenges facing Providence. Nirva has the experience – both professional and lived experience – to hit the ground running on Day One and begin delivering results for the people of Providence,\" Janey said in a statement.\n\nJaney served as Boston's acting mayor in 2021 for eight months, becoming the city's first woman and first Black mayor after former Mayor Marty Walsh joined President Joe Biden's cabinet as secretary of labor.\n\nAnother Providence mayoral hopeful, Gonzalo Cuervo, also added an new endorsement to his list – City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris, who described Cuervo as capable of leading \"the fight for social and economic justice.\"\n\n\"Gonzalo has been a strong advocate and ally for working families in Providence for decades; as a community leader, small business owner, and within city and state government,\" Harris said. \"He has the experience, vision, and strong community ties to create greater economic opportunities for our youth, families, and neighborhoods.\"\n\nJUNE 7: Rep. Cassar joins ranks of departing state lawmakers\n\nAs the candidate declaration period approaches, a fourth member of the House of Representatives has announced that she is not seeking reelection: Barrington Democrat Liana Cassar, whose district includes a slice of Riverside in East Providence.\n\nA two-term legislator, she waged a short-lived campaign to become House speaker in the fall of 2020, when then-Speaker Nicholas Mattiello was on the ropes. She has led this year's legislative campaign to repeal the ban on state-paid insurance coverage for state workers and Medicaid recipients seeking abortions.\n\nIn an email to colleagues, Cassar wrote: “After careful deliberation, I have decided not to seek re-election. ... The demanding legislative schedule does not leave me able to fully honor my commitments to the House, along with my commitments to my career and my family.\"\n\n\"When my current term is complete at the end of this year, I will miss the daily collaboration. ... [But] be assured that I will remain a strong voice advocating for my community as well as for justice and equity in Rhode Island.”\n\nThree other House Democrats are leaving: Rep. Gregg Amore of East Providence, to run for secretary of state; Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, to run for lieutenant governor; and freshman Steven Lima of Woonsocket, who has endorsed former Rep. Jon Brien, a Democrat-turned-independent, to replace him.\n\nBrien last served in the House in 2012. He had four years on the Woonsocket City Council more recently. Another former Woonsocket councilman, Alex Kithes, running under the Rhode Island Political Cooperative banner, has also announced for Lima's seat.\n\nOn the Senate side, there are three announced departures so far, including Senate Republican leader Dennis Algiere of Westerly. More are expected.\n\nTwo Democrats candidates so far have announced for the seat that Algiere has held for close to three decades: Victoria Gu and Michael Niemeyer.\n\nForced by redistricting into a potential fight to keep her Senate seat in a district straddling Warwick and Cranston, first-term Sen. Kendra Anderson also chose to bow out. She endorsed Harrison Tuttle, head of the Black Lives Matter Rhode Island Political Action Committee,as her replacement.\n\nAt least one other candidate, former state prosecutor Matt LaMountain, has announced for the seat.\n\nFreshman Sen. Cynthia Mendes, D-East Providence, has opted to run for lieutenant governor. At least two Democrats have expressed an interest in running for the seat: Jeff Britto and Greg Greco.\n\nCandidates have three days, June 27 to 29, to file their official paperwork to run for election to a state or local seat. The primary is Sept. 13 and the general election is Nov. 8. in the September 13 primary and the November 8 general election.\n\nJUNE 3: Raimondo joins former colleague Smiley for campaign event\n\nFormer Gov. Gina Raimondo is set to join mayoral candidate Brett Smiley on Friday, her support marking the highest-level endorsement in the race so far.\n\nRaimondo, who now serves as President Joe Biden's secretary of commerce, is scheduled to appear with Smiley at Farm Fresh Rhode Island, a local nonprofit that organizes farmers markets, among other activities.\n\nSmiley, who served as a top aide to Raimondo during her time as governor, will discuss the her administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an event description.\n\n\"Together, with our colleagues in government, we opened Rhode Island schools during a global pandemic, established statewide testing facilities and built field hospitals,\" a campaign email stated, adding that the duo will \"talk about both what we accomplished and how I will bring those lessons with me as Providence’s next mayor.\"\n\nRaimondo's trip comes not long after Raimondo visited Brown University in March to give a lecture on international affairs.\n\nMAY 31: Ex-mayoral candidate Michael Solomon endorses Brett Smiley\n\nMichael Solomon, who dropped out of Providence's mayoral race earlier this month, endorsed candidate Brett Smiley on Tuesday. He is part of a lengthy list of endorsements the former top aide to Gov. Gina Raimondo has received, several of them from the City Council. That includes Council President John Igliozzi, Councilwoman Jo-Ann Ryan and Councilmen Nicholas Narducci, Michael Correia and Jim Taylor.\n\nCandidate Gonzalo Cuervo has also amassed a list of endorsements from his former boss, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera, former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, Providence Councilwoman Rachel Miller and others. Former and current state lawmakers have also endorsed Smiley and Cuervo.\n\nCouncilwoman Nirva LaFortune has endorsements for from Reps. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell and Rebecca Kislak, and Dr. Joanna Brown, who teaches family medicine at Brown University.\n\nMAY 25: Democratic committee chairs endorse challengers over incumbents\n\nA majority of the chairs of 31 Democratic city and town committees have endorsed challengers over Gov. Dan McKee and his appointed lieutenant governor, Sabina Matos.\n\nVoting on Tuesday night, the Association of City and Town Democratic Chairs endorsed term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea for governor, over McKee, and Rep. Deborah Ruggiero, over Matos, according to Pam Lauria, the chair of the Barrington Democratic Town Committee and vice president of the chairs' association.\n\nThe group also endorsed Stefan Pryor for state treasurer over former Central Falls Mayor James Diossa, only hours after Pryor announced his candidacy, and Rep. Gregg Amore for secretary of state.\n\nThe votes represent a slice of the potential Democratic primary vote in September, but it is unclear how representative they are.\n\nIt has not been disclosed, for example, which cities and towns were represented in the vote, and which were not though Lauria, when asked, said she did not believe the chair of the Providence Democrats participated in the vote.\n\nIt is also unclear how many of the city and town committees have conducted their own votes, and the extent to which their votes matched those of their chairs.\n\nFor example, the Democrats on the Barrington committee endorsed Matos over Ruggiero, according to a list provided by Lauria. She said she was only aware of two that have voted so far, including her own.\n\nAccording to one account: Gorbea captured 17 of the 31 chairs voting, McKee 12 while two votes went elsewhere.\n\nAsked what he made of the endorsement by the association of chairs, McKee on Wednesday said: \"I don't make much of it.\"\n\nHe said the communities that were \"supporting us there...[are those] with populations that are very large,\" and \"communities with the largest populations in the state of Rhode Island are very supportive of me.\"\n\nMAY 16: Foulkes hits the air with first TV ad\n\nThe election-year air war is about to heat up with Democratic candidate for governor Helena Buonanno Foulkes -- sitting on the largest campaign bank balance of anyone in the race -- set to run her first television commercial.\n\nThe one-minute ad called \"Big Things\" focuses on the former CVS executive's biography and briefly touches on her main policy plans.\n\n\"I'm Helena Foulkes. Let's get big things done for Rhode Island,\" she says at the end of the ad as the camera pans from downtown Providence to the State House.\n\nCampaign watchers have been wondering when Foulkes would start advertising because of her sizable campaign war chest, but relatively low political profile, having never run for elected office before.\n\nAt the end of March, Foulkes reported $1.5 million in her campaign account.\n\nShe has hired veteran ad producer Tad Devine.\n\nRepublican Ashley Kalus, who is also new to politics, was the first gubernatorial candidate to hit the airwaves when she began advertising last month.\n\nMAY 12: Gorbea wins first union endorsement, while Foulkes doubles down on abortion funding\n\nWhile Helena Foulkes nudged Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday to take more aggressive action on abortion funding, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea - announced her first union endorsement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Ashley Kalus - the only candidate in the governor's race with TV ads so far - aired a new commercial stating her goals, without a lot of specifics on how she would get there. Among her goals: \"creating a world class education system.\"\n\nOn the endorsement front: \"Nellie Gorbea has and will continue to be a friend of workers and our union,\" said Derek Dunne with the United Steelworkers Local 12431 out of District 4 in a statement made public by the Gorbea campaign.\n\nThe union mentioned Democrat Gorbea's focus on \"creating good paying jobs through significant investment in sustainable housing and growing the blue economy.\"\n\nWith earlier endorsements from EMILY's List and the Latino Victory Fund, Gorbea has a ways to catch up with McKee.\n\nOn March 10, the McKee campaign announced endorsements from a coalition of construction unions and the powerful Laborers' International Union.\n\nThat included an endorsement from the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council representing 17 unions and the Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council.\n\nOn abortion, there is no major policy difference between Foulkes, a former CVS executive, and McKee.\n\nBut Foulkes on Thursday called on McKee to \"immediately submit a revised budget to the General Assembly that eliminates bans on abortion coverage\" for state workers and Medicaid recipients. .\n\n\"Abortion is healthcare and must be accessible for all, regardless of how much money you make or how you get health insurance,\" said Foulkes, accusing McKee of failing - in his then role as lieutenant governor - \"to lead in support'' of the 2019 law enshrining abortion rights in state law.\n\nThe McKee campaign declined comment. But soon after the potential repeal by the U.S. Supreme Court of the landmark Roe V. Wade abortion rights decision went public, McKee announced his \"full support\" for a pending bill to remove the restrictions on state-paid insurance coverage for abortions.\n\n\"He urges the General Assembly to pass this bill and send it to his desk for signature,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nMAY 9: The race heats up between Gorbea and Foulkes with exchange of digs\n\nWithout once mentioning the name of former CVS executive Helena Foulkes, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea tried Monday to link her fellow contender for governor to the potentially imminent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the landmark abortion-rights decision Roe v. Wade.\n\nGorbea fired off a fundraising email centered on Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's role in shaping the current makeup of the court.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, she said: \"Reminder that Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat which helped make [this] horrifying news possible. Which is just one in a very long list of reasons why donating to Mitch McConnell is never okay and inexcusable for someone who wants to be governor of RI.\"\n\nElaborating in a fundraising email that went out Monday, the Gorbea campaign said: \"McConnell has always been anti-choice and has spent decades reshaping our courts to ban abortion.\n\n\"That’s why it’s so shocking that Nellie’s wealthiest opponent personally contributed to his re-election campaign. ... This isn’t behavior we should accept from our next Democratic Governor of Rhode Island — and that’s why we need your support to win this race.\"\n\nFoulkes has acknowledged and publicly stated her regret for donating $500 to McConnell in 2014, about six months before Republicans took control of the Senate in midterm elections and McConnell became majority leader. She was head of CVS Health's pharmacy empire at the time.\n\nThe response from Foulkes spokeswoman Audrey Lucas to Gorbea: \"It is extremely disappointing that at a moment when reproductive rights are literally being taken away from women across the country, Secretary Gorbea would choose to attack a strongly pro-choice candidate.\n\n\"Sadly, this is typical for career politicians who spend their time launching attacks on their opponents rather than getting things done for Rhode Islanders.\n\n\"It’s also an interesting line of criticism coming from the Secretary, who started her career working for a Republican governor, refused to endorse Rhode Island’s first woman governor in her re-election, and knocked doors to help elect the pro-life Speaker of the House who prevented Rhode Island from codifying Roe v. Wade into state law for years.\"\n\nThe response alluded to an online photo of Gorbea knocking on doors on the campaign trail with then-House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello.\n\nIn response to earlier questions about the McConnell contribution, Foulkes said:\n\n\"Over the years I've made campaign contributions – mostly to Democrats, but to some Republicans, too – because, like most Rhode Islanders, I wanted a government where people from both parties could work together and get things done.\n\n\"One of the last Republicans I contributed to many years ago was Mitch McConnell and it's something I deeply regret and would never do again,\" she continued. \"It was before he colluded with Donald Trump to destroy the Supreme Court and more. I sincerely apologize.\"\n\nAPRIL 29: Gorbea says she leads the RI governor's race, according her pollster\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea says a poll conducted by her campaign shows she is the frontrunner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\nLake Research Partners, Gorbea's polling firm, released a polling memo Friday saying Gorbea had the support of 30% of the voters surveyed in a poll conducted earlier this month, compared to 24% for Gov. Dan McKee, 10% for former Secretary of State Matt Brown, 7% for former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes and 1% for Luis-Daniel Muñoz.\n\nTwenty-six percent of voters polled were undecided, the memo said. The full poll was not\n\nThe poll was conducted April 11 to 14 on both cell phones and landlines of 600 likely Democratic primary voters, the Lake polling memo said.\n\nLake Research Partners is the polling firm of longtime Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\n\nWhen Lake last polled the field, McKee led the field with 26% of the vote, the memo said.\n\nGorbea's poll said 55% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Gorbea compared with 48% for McKee, according to the memo.\n\nAPRIL 28: McKee's approval rate drops to 42% in new poll\n\nGov. Dan McKee's popularity has fallen dramatically since last year, according to a new online poll released Thursday that said 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing and 40% disapprove.\n\nLast fall, 60% of surveyed voters approved of the job McKee was doing and only 25% disapproved, according to Morning Consult. The 48th\n\nThe 18 percentage point drop in McKee's approval rating was the largest of any governor, Morning Consult said. And only two governors, Kate Brown of Oregon and David Ige of Hawaii, posted lower approval ratings.\n\nMassachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker retained the highest approval rating in the nation -- 74% -- in the survey, which was conducted from Jan. 1 to March 31 and included \"at least 601 registered voters in each state.\" Baker's disapproval rating was 21%.\n\nConnecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont posted the 18th highest approval rating at 57%, with 35% disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nAPRIL 21: Segal lands Elizabeth Warren endorsement\n\nA day after he officially launched his campaign for Congress, former State Rep. Segal picked up the endorsement of Massachusetts U.S. Sen. recent presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"I’ve worked with @DavidSegalRI on plans to level the economic playing field, support a responsible foreign policy, and build a government that Americans can trust to work for them,\" Warren tweeted Thursday morning. \"I’m happy to endorse him for Congress in #RI02 because he’s ready to make change happen.\"\n\nSegal, who co-founded the progressive advocacy group Demand Progress after leaving the General Assembly in 2011, is running on the left of what is now a five-person Democratic primary field to replace retiring Rep. Jim Langevin in the second congressional district.\n\nAPRIL 20: GOP candidate for RI governor, Ashley Kalus airing first TV ads of campaign season\n\nPROVIDENCE — Ashley Kalus, the Republican candidate for governor, has purchased roughly $109,000 of airtime in Rhode Island for the first TV ads of the '22 campaign season and separately, gone on the attack against R.I.'s political establishment.\n\nThe ad buy - scheduled to run Wednesday through April 26 - was first reported by the local CBS affiliate, WPRI, and confirmed by Kalus' Ohio-based media buying firm, Medium Buying. It is scheduled to run on \"broadcast, cable, radio and regional sports\" networks, according to the firm.\n\nThe 60-second TV ad echoes the video clip Kalus, a relative newcomer to Rhode Island, released to introduce herself to her new home state when she announced for governor, including her declaration that the days of \"I know a guy\" are over.\n\nShe sent a link to the ad to members of the Republican State Central Committee on Tuesday night, along with an email that said, in part: \"Big News!\"\n\n\"I wanted you to be the first to know that we are taking our campaign across all media fronts tomorrow. Since we launched last month, we have campaigned through almost every city and town across Rhode Island.\n\n\"We are going to campaign just as hard in Providence and Pawtucket as we are in Warwick and Cranston. For too long, Democrats have taken the Black and Hispanic vote for granted and I plan on fighting for everyone’s vote.\"\n\nFrom there she launched into an attack on the \"career politicians and insiders [who] have taken advantage of the taxpayers.\"\n\n\"Rhode Islanders foot the bill so insiders can line their own pockets,'' she wrote. \"Just the latest examples are the failed merger of Lifespan and Care New England, handing out $3,000 bonuses to politically appointed judges, and now the proposed corporate welfare for the Superman Building.\"\n\n\"I'm going to the Statehouse to shake things up!\" she said, in her email, not the ad.\n\nFor the record, the $3,000 bonuses for judges were awarded by the Chief Justice of the R.I. Supreme Court, not Gov. Dan McKee, the Democrat she hopes to replace. But the award came to light after McKee awarded like-sized \"retention bonuses to unionized employees across state government.\n\nAPRIL 18: Gorbea releases 10 years of tax filings, asks competitors in race for governor to do same\n\nPROVIDENCE — Rhode Island's term-limited Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea on Monday made 10 years of her tax filings public, and called on her opponents in the race for governor to do the same.\n\nThere has been no direct response to that late-day challenge from incumbent Gov. Dan McKee, who was headed out-of-state to a Democratic governor's conference on Monday, or the other candidates in the race.\n\nWith two exceptions, all of Gorbea's competitors have released their own tax returns annually, to one degree or another, but none going back 10 years.\n\nThe two exceptions: dark horse Democratic candidate Luis-Daniel Munoz, who declined to do so in the past, and Republican candidate Ashley Kalus who has not yet responded to Journal inquiries on Monday on her willingness to make her tax filings public.\n\nAs a starting point, Gorbea made public the top pages of her filings as she has done before during her years in state office - but did so for a ten-year period that extends back to a point before she held elected office.\n\nMost recently, she and her husband, Steven L. DHondt paid $60,127 in federal taxes and $16,818 in state taxes to Rhode Island on their adjusted gross income of $325,666.\n\nHer campaign said copies of her full return would be made available to the media upon request.\n\nExplaining her own decision to release 10 years of tax filings, Gorbea said: \"Rhode Islanders deserve nothing less than full transparency from their elected officials—especially from anyone who is seeking to lead the state.\n\n\"This shouldn’t be complicated,” she said.\n\n“As gubernatorial candidates, we are asking Rhode Islanders for their trust to run our state. They deserve to know how much we are paid, any potential conflicts of interest, and then how much we paid in state and federal taxes.\n\n\"Too many voters are cynical and disillusioned,\" she said. \"It’s not healthy for our politics locally or our democracy as a whole. I’m committed to transparency and accountability.\"\n\nAPRIL 15: Lt. Gov. Matos touts endorsements- 'an American success story'\n\nPROVIDENCE — A day after her official campaign launch, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos is touting a swath of endorsements from the labor and political world, including Armand Sabitoni, the general-secretary- treasurer of the Laborers International Union of North America.\n\nOne of her two Democratic primary opponents - Rep. Deborah Ruggiero - has captured the endorsement of many of her House colleagues, including the speaker who has an outsized voice over the state Democratic Party endorsement...\n\nBut Matos - who highlights her status as \"the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Rhode Island\" - on Friday announced endorsements from the governor and nine state lawmakers - including Senate Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin and Rep. Grace Diaz, the vice-chair of the state Democratic Party,\n\nOthers on the list of people endorsing Matos - who was the president of the Providence City Council until Gov. Dan McKee appointed her lieutenant governor a year ago - include the mayors of East Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence and Newport and former Providence Mayor Angel Tavares.\n\n\"Like many of our members, Sabina Matos is an American success story,\" said Michael Sabitoni, chairman of the Rhode Island Council of Building Trades.\n\nRecalling her history as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic 28 years ago who became the president of the Providence City Council before her appointment to lieutenant governor, Sabitoni said:\n\n“While on the council, she championed the passage of numerous ordinances promoting economic development for Providence residents and their families... She shattered a glass ceiling long overdue for smashing, and uses her office every day to advocate for all Rhode Islanders.\" (Michael and Armand Sabitoni are cousins.)\n\nOther union leaders on the list are affiliated with SEIU Local 580 and the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.\n\nMatos also picked up an endorsement from former state Democratic Party chairman Bill Lynch.\n\nMatos is seeking election for the first time to the job to which she was appointed by McKee after he ascended from lieutenant governor on March 2, 2021 on the heels of Gina Raimondo's resignation to take a Biden cabinet post.\n\nShe is competing with Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes for the Democratic nomination.\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nCandidate Michael Neary issued a statement Thursday from Columbus, Ohio, confirming his intent to stay in the race for Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District seat despite his recent arrest on charges of drug possession and \"menacing\" an Ohio couple on an interstate.\n\n\"I am currently seeking medical and mental health treatment and have been referred to a neurologist for a possible non-Epileptic seizure-related condition,'' Neary said in his statement, affirming his plans to remain in the Congressional race \"all the way to the September primary.\"\n\n\"I know there are many questions surrounding recent news reports, and a full statement will be forthcoming in the coming days,\" he said. .\n\nThe Ohio couple told authorities they were \"scared for their life\" after a bizarre run-in with Neary on the road the morning of March 23, according to an arrest report released by the Miami County Sheriff's Office.\n\nNeary pleaded not guilty to the charges, was released on $2,500 bond and ordered to appear in court for a pretrial conference on April 21, according to court records.\n\nAsked Thursday to clarify his situation, Neary said: \"I changed my voter registration some time ago and have been staying with my parents in Coventry while trying to find a permanent living situation in town.\"\n\nBut, \"I am currently in Columbus where ... I am actively seeking medical treatment. ... That is where I am right now and what I am currently doing before I can return home to Rhode Island permanently.\"\n\nThe Ohio couple described being followed by a vehicle that sped up, slowed down and exited the highway when they did, more than once.\n\nWhen the authorities caught up with him, \"Mr. Neary appeared to be nervous, his eyes were bloodshot and he was talking fast,\" the report said.\n\nNeary initially told deputies that he had known the driver of the car that he was following, but then changed his story and said that he was \"drawn to the Ohio registration on that vehicle,\" according to the police report.\n\nNeary reportedly told police that he \"recently has been stressed and went out for a drive to clear his head,\" that he had been staying with his parents in Rhode Island and had a big argument with them before he left.\n\nNeary allowed police to search his 2017 Hyundai Elantra, which is registered to a Columbus address. According to the report, police found a half-empty bottle of whisky, a clear plastic container containing baggies of marijuana, a ceramic pipe and a grinder.\n\nBefore his arrest, Neary told The Providence Journal that he was a sixth-generation Rhode Islander who had grown up in Coventry but had recently been living in Ohio.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Neary said this is the first time he has ever been arrested,, \"so I am also focused on addressing the Misdemeanor charges here in Ohio.\" In the interim, he said: \"steps have been taken to retain legal counsel.\"\n\n\"While these have been a difficult few weeks for our family as we deal with various private matters together, the stories we have heard from Rhode Islanders about the problems they are facing in their everyday lives over the last several months is my only motivation to continue this campaign.\"\n\nAPRIL 14:\n\nFoulkes reports raising $1.3 million in first quarter\n\nFormer CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes' campaign said Thursday she raised $1.3 million in the first three months of the year, the largest quarterly fundraising total claimed by any of the candidates for governor so far.\n\nFoulkes' first-quarter fundraising includes $900,000 in donations and a $400,000 personal loan to her campaign, spokeswoman Audrey Lucas said. She said \"nearly half\" of the contributions came from new donors.\n\nThe $1.3-million tally should give Foulkes the financial edge in the battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, she raised $973,000 from donors and put $100,000 of her own money into the race, which at the time was the largest fundraising quarter of the race.\n\nGov. Dan McKee's campaign said he raised over $400,000 in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea and former secretary of state Matt Brown have not shared any details of their first-quarter fundraising yet.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ashley Kalus two weeks ago announced that she had loaned her campaign $500,000 of her own money.\n\nRhode Island candidates have until the end of the month to file their official campaign finance reports.\n\nThose reports will include how much each of the candidates have spent as well as a breakdown of their donors.\n\n“Every day our campaign gets stronger as Helena meets Rhode Islanders all across the state and shares her positive vision to transform our public schools, make it more affordable to live in Rhode Island and create great jobs for all,” Lucas said in a news release. “We are so grateful for the support we’ve received, which will allow us to get our message out to voters and position us to win this race.”\n\nAPRIL 8:\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos assembles election campaign team\n\nLt. Gov. Sabina Matos will make it official on Thursday that she is running for election to the job to which she was appointed by Gov. Dan McKee last spring after his own blink-of-the eye ascension to governor..\n\nIn a news release that went out Friday afternoon, Matos – the first Afro-Latina to hold statewide office in Rhode Island – also named the key members of her campaign team. They include many familiar names.\n\n\"When I came to Rhode Island as a 20-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, I never thought I would run for public office, much less serve as Lieutenant Governor,\" she said, according to the news release.\n\n\"But in America, anything is possible. Now I’m working to fix systemic injustices and make sure everyone has the same opportunities I did. I understand the challenges facing Rhode Islanders because they’re mine as well. I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because Rhode Islanders deserve a champion that puts them first.”\n\nHer campaign hires include:\n\n*Kristina Contreras Fox as campaign manager. Contreras Fox most recently led policy and advocacy efforts for the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, and before that was field director for Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza's campaign. .\n\n*Mike Raia of Half Street Strategic Consulting, as senior advisor for communications. Raia did a turn as Gov. Gina Raimondo's communications director and also served as a senior advisor to Raimondo’s 2018 reelection campaign.\n\n*Pete Brodnitz of Expedition Strategies as the campaign’s research consultant. Brodnitz did polling for Raimondo, consulted on both of her winning campaigns for governor and led the research operation for Attorney General Peter Neronha’s campaign in 2018.\n\n*Tierney Hunt and Matt Burgess of The New Media Firm as the leads on Matos's television, digital and radio advertising efforts. Hunt and Burgess have worked on a number of notable Democratic and progressive campaigns, including efforts for EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Votes.\n\nDemocrat Matos, the former president of the Providence City Council, was appointed by McKee to replace himself as lieutenant governor when Raimondo left for a Biden Cabinet post, and he was automatically elevated to governor.\n\nMatos faces two Democratic challengers so far, state Rep. Deb Ruggiero and state Sen. Cynthia Mendes.\n\nAPRIL 6:\n\nHouse speaker endorses Rep. Ruggiero's campaign for lieutenant governor\n\nIf Gov. Dan McKee was hoping state Democratic Party leaders would endorse his hand-picked lieutenant governor, the chances dimmed Wednesday when House Speaker Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi endorsed a House colleague instead.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Deb Ruggiero's campaign announced that she had picked up the endorsements of Shekarchi and 35 other Democratic office-holders and activists, including the House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski and Majority Whip Katherine Kazarian, and 10 other House colleagues.\n\nWhoever is House speaker traditionally has an outsized voice in who gets the state Democratic Committee endorsement, because the majority of the members are appointed by House District Committees, whose members are themselves appointed by state representatives who, in turn, have elected the speaker as their leader.\n\nIn this case, Shekarchi endorsed Ruggiero over the incumbent, Sabina Matos, who was appointed by McKee to take his place after then-Gov. Gina Raimondo resigned for a post in the Biden Cabinet last year. State Sen. Cynthia Mendes is also running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday morning, Ruggiero told The Journal she does not intend to seek the state Democratic Party's endorsement. \"I am going to stay in my lane, run my race, stay focused and positive ... and do the work I need to do.\n\n\"I don't want this to be divisive,\" she said.\n\nOne potential outcome – seen before – is that the state party opts for neutrality in a race that pits that governor's choice against the speaker's.\n\nIn a statement accompanying Wednesday's announcement, Shekarchi said he was \"proudly\" endorsing Ruggiero, with whom he has worked since he was first elected 10 years ago.\n\n\"She is an extremely dedicated, hard-working and honest public servant. As a long-time member of the House Finance Committee, Deb has a great understanding of state government and she is highly qualified to hit the ground running from Day One,\" he said.\n\nRuggiero has represented House District 74, encompassing Jamestown and Middletown, for the past 14 years and currently chairs the House Committee on Innovation, Internet, and Technology and has a seat on the House Finance Committee.\n\nIn other campaign news, Democrat McKee picked up the endorsement of two other private-sector unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Locals 99 and 2323, which together say they represent about 2,850 current and retired electrical and telecom workers.\n\nMcKee \"has been a strong ally for our members and all people who work with their hands for a living. Coming into office during one of the most challenging moments in our state’s history, [he] rolled up his sleeves and focused on keeping our economy open and getting people back to work,\" said Joe Walsh Jr., IBEW Local 99 business manager.\n\n“Governor McKee has been put to the test in his first year in office – leading our state through a difficult public health and economic crisis – and has earned re-election,\" echoed Christopher Buffery, IBEW Local 2323 business manager.\n\nThe two locals join the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, the Laborers’ District Council, and seven mayors and town administrators in endorsing McKee's election bid.\n\nAPRIL 4:\n\nCongressional candidates tout big Q1 fundraising totals\n\nSarah Morgenthau's and Allan Fung's congressional campaigns said Monday they've raised more than $500,000 in the first three months of the year, while Seth Magaziner said he's pulled in $1.4 million over that period.\n\nOn Tuesday Democrat Joy Fox, a former staffer to U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin and Gina Raimondo, said she had raised \"more than $175,000 from 406 contributions since launching in February.\"\n\nFormer state Rep. David Segal, who is officially still exploring getting in the second district Democratic primary, said he raised $252,000 since late February.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Republican state Sen. Jessica de la Cruz said she raised $85,000 since launching her campaign last month.\n\nIn a news release, she said 96% of her 250 donors were from Rhode Island.\n\nCandidates are not required to file their official first-quarter fundraising reports, which include the source of donations and any personal loans, until later in the month.\n\n\"In just five weeks time, we have accumulated an excess of $500,00", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-2024-live-results-updates/72839863007/", "title": "Super Tuesday recap: Trump, Biden pick up big wins; Haley set to ...", "text": "Nikki Haley will drop out of the 2024 presidential race after voters across the country made their voices heard on Super Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump defeated Haley, the former South Carolina Governor, in more than a dozen states, taking his most significant step yet towards the 2024 Republican nomination.

However, it did issue a warning about \"unity\" within the Republican Party.\n\n\"Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump. That is not the unity our party needs for success. \" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. \"Addressing those voters’ concerns will make the Republican Party and America better.\"\n\nHaley is on track to lose all but one state, Vermont, on Super Tuesday.

That’s why a Republican and a Democrat are moving forward to November’s general election in the state.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Kathryn Palmer\n\nIs Vermont an open primary?\n\nNikki Haley has defeated Donald Trump in one Super Tuesday state so far: Vermont.\n\nVermont does not have party registration, so registered voters can choose to vote in any party's (Republican, Democrat and Progressive) presidential primary election.

Two weeks ago, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in in vitro fertilization are considered children and are entitled to protections under the state’s wrongful death laws.\n\nThe blowback was immediate: The decision kicked off a frenzy among patients and doctors grappling with its implications for people attempting to conceive, often after years of struggling to have children or other complications in family planning. Democrats immediately began messaging on the ruling as further evidence of a GOP-led effort to restrict reproductive rights.\n\nThe Senate Republican campaign arm urged Senate candidates to \"clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government\" to restrict IVF. Candidates followed suit, as did most Republican lawmakers in Congress.\n\nBut when Democrats in the Senate put them to the test by asking them to greenlight a bill that would protect IVF at the federal level, many Republican senators said it’s an issue best left up to the states.− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden wins Iowa's Democratic Caucus\n\nJoe Biden won Iowa's Democratic caucus, clinching a quick victory to kick off Super Tuesday's results.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nChris Christie, Ryan Binkley, Asa Hutchinson: Which candidates have dropped out of the 2024 race?\n\nOn the Republican side, Florida Gov.

Some experts and advocates fear the laws could impact turnout on Super Tuesday, a test for the November general election.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Chris Kenning\n\nHow many states vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on March 5 include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on Super Tuesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nCalifornia Senate race: Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and other Democrats compete\n\nTuesday will also determine which two candidates in the heated California Senate race will advance to the general election. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, will land on the ballot in November.\n\nWhile Californians will choose from 27 candidates on Tuesday, the likely frontrunners are among three Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee – and one Republican, Steve Garvey, a former baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The candidates are running to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who died last year.\n\nPolling from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, last week found Garvey in a two-point lead over Schiff coming in at 27%. Schiff polled at 25% followed by Porter and Lee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nSome states hold primaries, while others opt for a caucus. While a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting taking place via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer, and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\nUp for grabs in each caucus and primary is a certain number of delegates. The delegates are sent to each party's national convention, and the candidate with the majority secures the nomination.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJoe Biden competes in Super Tuesday ahead of the State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden is competing in more than a dozen Super Tuesday states before he delivers his 2024 State of the Union address to lawmakers and Americans across the country on Thursday.\n\nThe president is expected to address the issues dividing the nation, ranging from inflation to abortion rights and the U.S. southern border. You can read more about the history of the presidential address here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAlabama voters were sent wrong information ahead of election\n\nA representative from the Montgomery County Board of Registrars confirmed Tuesday that a portion of Montgomery voters got the wrong voting information ahead of the election.\n\nRegistrar Mark Anderson said on Super Tuesday that a mapping issue led to voters in the 2nd Congressional District being told that they were in a different district.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported that at least 5,604 voters received information that they were in the 7th Congressional District, instead of the newly established, majority-Black 2nd District. Of the 5,604 voters, 4,513 of them are Black, SPLC reported.\n\nThe SPLC became aware of the issue over the weekend. Some Montgomery County voters received postcards with the incorrect congressional district.\n\n– Alex Gladden\n\nTrump says he’s not worried about raising money for legal cases\n\nIn addition to running a presidential campaign, Trump is spending his recent days trying to figure out how to pay more than $500 million in civil damages for bank fraud and defamation.\n\nIn his Super Tuesday interview on Fox News, Trump said he will be able to raise the money - but he didn’t say how.\n\n“I don’t worry about anything,” Trump said. “No, I don't worry about the money. I don't worry about money.”\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat states did Trump, Biden win on previous Super Tuesdays?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, 14 states held primaries on Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump, the incumbent nominee running for his second term, carried all 13 of the Super Tuesday states (Virginia cancelled its GOP primary). Biden won by slightly smaller margins, winning delegates in 11 states with four going to then-candidate Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nWhen Trump launched his first presidential campaign in 2016, 11 states held primaries on Super Tuesday. The former president competed in a crowded field of Republicans but ultimately won in seven of the eleven states. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was declared the winner in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won one state.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill Nikki Haley suspend her campaign?\n\nThe former South Carolina governor has repeatedly said she has no plans to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House. But Tuesday has the potential to deliver one of the heaviest blows to her campaign, and speculation has grown about her next steps.\n\nWould she join the long list of Republicans who have dropped out of the race and backed Trump as nominee? Or will Haley, seen by many as a moderate alternative to a Biden-Trump rematch, launch a third-party run?\n\nHaley continued to dodge the first question, defiantly telling Fox News Monday afternoon that they should ask Trump whether he would support another Republican nominee instead.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat will Donald Trump do after Super Tuesday?\n\nSince announcing his campaign in 2022, the former president has looked like a shoo-in for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAnd while Super Tuesday can’t clinch the spot for him – a nominee needs 1,215 delegates, and Trump will still be a handful short even if he sweeps the country – Tuesday could very well boost him closer to the finish line.\n\nBut despite his popularity with his conservative base, Trump would also likely need to tap into support from moderates and independents in a general election. Trump appeared to be starting that shift after his first primary election victory in January’s Iowa Caucuses.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFacebook down on Super Tuesday\n\nFacebook users may have encountered the social media site not working properly on the morning of Super Tuesday.\n\nAround 9 a.m. ET, hundreds of thousands of users reported Facebook being down during one of the biggest election days of the year, according to Downdetector.\n\nMany users were reporting being logged out of Facebook accounts with no ability to log back in. It's unclear when Facebook will be back online for some users as polls begin opening for primary voters.\n\n-- Jonathan Limehouse\n\nStein: ‘Grab your photo ID’ North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein had some sage advice for voters flocking to the polls on Tuesday: bring a photo ID card.\n\nThat’s because the swing state has a litany of new laws that will be tested for the first time on Super Tuesday as Tar Heel State voters make a choice in one of the most closely watched gubernatorial contests this year.\n\nAmong them is a 2018 voter identification law that had been delayed by lawsuits. Another rule change also required mail-in ballots to include a copy of the voter’s photo ID.\n\nIn 2023, Republican state legislators went further by establishing a rule that any mail-in ballot received after the election wouldn’t be counted which Democratic opponents slammed because it kills the previous three-day grace period that allowed ballots to be counted as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nVoting rights groups have warned such laws will be hard to navigate for some, and they are keeping an eye out for trouble.\n\nStein, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination for governor, has spoken against the new laws and resisted them in his capacity as attorney general. He is likely to face Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who has spoken in favor of such laws as needed to protect election integrity.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat to watch in North Carolina’s governor’s race\n\nNorth Carolina will serve as the battleground for a marquee gubernatorial race: a likely faceoff between a Southern Democrat and a GOP candidate who is popular with Donald Trump's base.\n\nAs millions are flocking to the polls for Super Tuesday, primary voters in North Carolina have a sharp contrast in the two party's leading contenders to fill Cooper's seat: Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson.\n\nOnce a reliable Republican stronghold − long associated with the southern fried conservatism of the late Sen. Jesse Helms − the Tar Heel State has become more competitive largely because of diverse population growth.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNorth Carolina primary to set the stage for 2024 battleground\n\nPresidential candidates have been focusing their attention on North Carolina in the leadup to Super Tuesday, setting the groundwork for what analysts expect will be a hyper-competitive general election matchup.\n\nNorth Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democratic president since Barack Obama flipped the state in 2008. But it represented Donald Trump’s narrowest margin of victory in the 2020 election when he won it by just 1.34 percentage points over Joe Biden.\n\nBiden’s campaign is already setting its sights on an expected rematch, earlier this year installing a team of campaign staffers on the ground and committing Biden and other surrogates to appearing in the state.\n\nDemocrats dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Durham ahead of Super Tuesday to announce a $32 million investment from the American Rescue Plan Act, and Biden was in the state in January announcing a major investment in broadband internet infrastructure.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump campaigned in Greensboro March 2 while his primary competitor Nikki Haley rallied supporters in Charlotte and Raleigh.\n\nPolling places are open in North Carolina until 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n—Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhy is today called Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the primary election day that decides the bulk of delegates for candidates in their respective parties.\n\nThe name “Super Tuesday” historical has been used to reference primary days when a significant number of states hold their primary elections, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIn 1984, the modern \"Super Tuesday\" began when March became the month to “frontload” the primaries.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDonald Trump to hold rally Saturday in Georgia\n\nThe Trump campaign is starting to outline its post-Super Tuesday schedule, and it includes a weekend rally in a politically and legally significant state: Georgia.\n\nThe Saturday event takes place in Rome, Ga.\n\nTrump held a similar rally in nearby Dalton, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021 - two days before the attempted insurrection by Trump supporters that tried to block Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote that elected Biden.\n\nUsing that rally in part to protest the 2020 election, Trump basically urged Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans to toss Biden electoral votes and re-elect him instead.\n\n\"People will remember the people who don’t support us,\" Trump said on that occasion.\n\nTrump now faces criminal trials in Georgia and in Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nIowa Poll: Trump dominates Biden in 2024 lead-up\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump would nearly double his margin of victory in Iowa over incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden if a rematch of their 2020 contest were held now, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn an early test of the expected matchup, Trump leads Biden by 15 percentage points among likely voters, 48% to 33%. Another 15% of poll respondents would vote for “someone else,” 1% would not vote and 2% are not sure.\n\nIn 2020, Trump defeated Biden in Iowa by about 8 percentage points.\n\n- Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhat states are involved on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on Tuesday include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on March 5.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump calls for Republican unity - while blasting Haley\n\nTrump began his Super Tuesday with a phone interview on Fox News and predicted Republican unity in the fall election - though he had few good things to say about Haley and her supporters.\n\n\"There's no path for her to win,\" Trump said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding that her continuing candidacy is only \"hurting the Republican Party.\"\n\nStill, Trump said that \"our party has to come together because we have to beat the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to exit polls, many Haley supporters say they will not back Trump in the general election; that could create a drag that will undercut Trump's chances of defeating Biden.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nTaylor Swift encourages fans to vote on Super Tuesday\n\nTaylor Swift encouraged fans to vote on Super Tuesday but did not make a presidential endorsement.\n\n\"Today, March 5, is the Presidential Primary in Tennessee and 16 other states and territories,\" Swift wrote in her Instagram story. \"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power. If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\n\"Whether you're in Tennessee or somewhere else in the US,\" Swift continued, \"check your polling places and times at vote.org.\"\n\n- Bryan West\n\nDo Democrats vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nYes – Democrats also vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic primary is not as consequential as the Republican primary because President Joe Biden is the incumbent candidate running for his second term and the likely Democratic nominee for the party in a much less contentious race for the nomination.\n\nWhile Biden does face two Democratic challengers – Dean Phillips and Marianne WIlliamson – both have yet to receive any delegates during state primaries held previously. Biden has 206 delegates prior to Super Tuesday polls closing.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat races are at stake on Super Tuesday – other than the presidential election?\n\nIt’s not just the presidential primaries that matter on Super Tuesday. Other competitive election are slated to happen in the states voting on March 5.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, is seeing a fierce intra-party primary battle between three major Democrats for a solidly blue open Senate seat in the liberal state. California voters will also consider a ballot measure known as Proposition 1, which would address the state's mental health system and homelessness crisis.\n\nNorth Carolinians will also vote in a gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, setting up what's expected to be a high-pressure race in the fall. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, while North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is expected to lead Republicans.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCandidates need to reach 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, 1,420 delegates are up for grabs, nearly three quarters of the delegates needed to become the party nominee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhich Super Tuesday states have open primaries?\n\nMost primaries fall into one of five categories: closed, partially closed, open to unaffiliated voters, partially open and open, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. The critical distinction among the categories is whether voters who are not registered party members can participate in a party’s primary.\n\nOpen primaries allow voters to choose which party’s ballot to vote without having to disclose or register with that respective party. This gives voters the opportunity to vote across party lines. Six Super Tuesday states will hold open primaries: Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nFive other states - Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee – will be open to unaffiliated voters on Super Tuesday, meaning voters who are not registered to a specific party can participate in a party’s primary of their choosing.\n\n- Kathryn Palmer and Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/us/five-things-may-8-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on May 8, 2022: Start your week smart: Ukraine ...", "text": "Happy Mother’s Day!

If a woman does not follow the rules, her “male guardian” will be visited and advised, and eventually jailed and sentenced.\n\n• An explosion rocked the historic Hotel Saratoga in the center of Cuba’s capital of Havana on Friday, killing at least 30 people, Cuban officials say, and leaving more than 60 hospitalized for injuries.\n\nThe week ahead\n\nMonday\n\nThere is speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin could formally declare war on Ukraine on Monday, which a symbolic day for Russia. May 9 is known as “Victory Day” and commemorates the country’s defeat of the Nazis in 1945. Western officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of the day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities – or both. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, and since then, Putin has insisted that his troops are carrying out a “special military operation” instead of a war.\n\nThe Philippine presidential election is also scheduled to take place on Monday. The current front-runner is Ferdinand Marcos Jr. – the son and namesake of the Philippines’ late deposed dictator.\n\nTuesday\n\nPrimary elections are set to kick off across Nebraska and West Virginia Tuesday. In Nebraska, eyes are on a Republican candidate for governor – but not for positive reasons. Charles Herbster, a rancher and businessman who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, is facing multiple allegations he inappropriately touched women. Trump stood by him even after the Nebraska Examiner reported in mid-April that seven women, including Republican state Sen. Julie Slama, had accused Herbster of groping them at political events or beauty pageants, with an additional woman accusing him of kissing her forcibly. In six cases, at least one eyewitness corroborated the women’s allegations, the publication reported. Herbster has denied the allegations, calling them “100% false.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is also scheduled to be deposed Tuesday as part of a class-action lawsuit alleging some members of the Trump family collaborated with a fraudulent marketing company. Donald Trump and his two adult sons have agreed to sit for depositions in May and June. The former President agreed to be deposed on June 16 while Eric Trump will sit for questioning on May 12, according to a letter filed with the court.\n\nTuesday also marks three years since the death of Ronald Greene in police custody. Greene died on May 10, 2019, after police said he resisted arrest and struggled with officers. His family has said they were told Greene died in a car crash after a police chase. Video of the incident released two years later showed officers kicking, punching and using a taser on Greene before he died in their custody.\n\nThursday\n\nThursday is International Nurses Day!

Trump faces over 90 charges in four indictments from New York to Florida. The former president and his businesses also face a number of civil lawsuits.\n\nFor Biden, age has been a concern among voters heading into the election, but a recent report from the Justice Department special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents thrust the issue into the spotlight after portraying Biden as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities\" and memory loss.\n\nIf elected, each candidate would top the list for oldest-serving presidents at the end of their terms. Biden would be 86 years old at the end of his second term, while Trump would be 82.\n\nWith Trump's legal proceedings as well as both candidates' ages, what would happen in a hypothetical situation where either nominee drops out of the race because they become incapacitated, convicted of charges or end up in jail?\n\nThe answer largely matters when.\n\n\"I think the unprecedented nature of this is you have a former president who's facing 91 indictments on one side and for both likely nominees, they're old,\" Josh Putnam, a political scientist who specializes in delegate selection rules and campaigns, told USA TODAY. \"Actuarially speaking, something could happen to one or both of them and they may not be around through the whole process.\"\n\nHere's how things could play out if Biden or Trump drop out of the 2024 race for the White House:\n\nDuring primary season and before national conventions\n\nExperts told USA TODAY if either candidate drops out before the national conventions − held in July for Republicans and August for Democrats − the path to finding the next nominee becomes more complicated.\n\nWhy are the conventions so important?\n\nThe national party conventions are held every presidential election year to officially select each party's nominee.\n\nAfter states hold their primaries, a certain number of delegates are allocated to a candidate based on the number of votes they received in the respective state. These delegates represent the candidate at each party's convention. The candidate must accumulate a majority of delegate votes to become the official party nominee.\n\nEach state allocates delegates differently depending on their system. In some cases, the candidate who wins the state receives all the state's delegates. In other states, delegates are split based on the percentage of votes a candidate receives.\n\nWhen delegates head to each party's national convention, they are generally tied to a certain candidate through the primary and caucus process in their states.\n\nBut it can get more complicated.\n\nIn some states, Republicans have \"unbound\" delegates who can cast a vote for whichever candidate they choose. Democrats have their own version − \"unpledged\" delegates − who can only participate in the voting process if the first round is contested, meaning no candidate received the majority of votes.\n\nIn the case of a contested election, there is a second (and possibly third, fourth, fifth, etc.) round of votes − similar to the uphill battle former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., faced during the 15 rounds of voting to win the speakership in January 2023.\n\nAnother piece that comes into play is exactly when Biden or Trump would drop out during primary season. If a candidate drops out early on before racking up a large number of delegates, other White House hopefuls may decide they want to try to win the nomination by gaining the remaining delegates.\n\n\"In other words, there's more time for competition,\" DNC member Elaine Kamarck, who is also a founding director and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said.\n\nBut if they drop out toward the end of the primaries, which end in mid-June, the number of delegates a candidate will receive is mostly set in stone.\n\nWhile the primaries establish how many delegate slots a candidate receives, Putnam, who is also the founder of FHQ Strategies, a nonpartisan political consulting venture, emphasized that determining the number of delegate slots does not simultaneously select the actual people who will fill those slots − a process that often lags behind primary election dates.\n\nAnd this process is equally as important, he said, especially in a scenario where a presumptive nominee drops out.\n\n\"The selection of the people there matters as to who's going to be making the decision at the convention as to who the replacement would become,\" Putnam said.\n\nFor example, Putnam said the Trump campaign is working to ensure that any delegate slots Trump is allocated will be filled by loyal supporters who would back the former president regardless of any convictions he could potentially face.\n\nIn a scenario where Biden or Trump drop out before the delegate selection process concludes, Putnam said it becomes more of a \"free for all\" as to how state parties would fill the delegate slots. These delegates would take part in the convention and potentially nominate someone who wasn't on the ballot.\n\nDuring the national conventions\n\nIf a candidate drops out between the last primary and the night of their respective party's nominating convention, each party reverts back to its historic roots.\n\nRepublicans would arrive in Milwaukee and Democrats in Chicago. Delegates would be \"uncommitted,\" meaning they are not in support of a specific candidate and have to decide who the next nominee will be.\n\nIn this scenario, prospective party nominees would visit each state's delegation to convince them for their support.\n\nBut what about Republican candidates who ran during primaries − like former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley − and dropped out, but still accumulated a handful of delegates?\n\nThe idea that Haley could emerge as the alternate at the Republican convention if Trump is toppled by his legal woes is wishful thinking, strategists told USA TODAY. In a situation where Trump is no longer in the picture, the delegates bound to the former president could decide to back someone completely different who never ran a campaign during primary season.\n\nAt this point in the race, it's unlikely Haley would be able to garner more delegates than Trump, specifically after the GOP's rules changed and converted many states to a winner-take-all system for allocating delegates.\n\n\"I think it's going to be hard for her to accumulate any more delegates. I think it's that dire,\" John Fortier, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank the American Enterprise Institute, told USA TODAY.\n\nFortier said if Trump were to drop out of the race before the convention, it is possible other GOP contenders who previously dropped out of the race would reactivate their campaigns in hopes of winning the Republican Party's nomination.\n\nAfter national conventions\n\nThe process varies for the Democratic and Republican national committees if their respective candidate drops out of the race after they've been officially nominated at the party's convention.\n\nPutnam said the national parties do the picking and choosing of who the replacement candidate will be.\n\n\"I think that's probably the least messy version of this,\" he said.\n\nBoth committees will hold special meetings to pick their next candidate.\n\nA similar process happened during the 1972 conventions. Democratic presidential nominee and three-term Sen. George McGovern's vice presidential pick, former Sen. Tom Eagleton, D-Mo., was being treated for mental illness and forced to resign from the ticket.\n\nMcGovern chose a replacement for his running mate, but it needed to be formally ratified by the DNC.\n\nIn this scenario, Kamarck said the chair makes the decision as to when the special meeting is called to order. It's possible the chair will want to hold the meeting quickly to allow the new nominee to campaign against the opposite party, but may also choose to wait a few weeks to see if a different candidate enters the race.\n\nAt this point, it's judgment calls per the party chair, she said.\n\n\"Closer to Election Day, it probably would be pretty smooth,\" Kamarck said. \"Earlier, say the end of August, other people may decide that they want to try and run and get the nomination. ... In other words, there's more time for competition.\"\n\nFortier said the timing of when a chosen party nominee drops out before Election Day could make things tricky when it comes to what name appears on the ballot. Because ballots need to be printed and in some cases sent out 45 days before Election Day, its possible the name of an ex-candidate appears on the ticket.\n\n\"There is a point at which the people you're replacing with could not appear on the ballot that people are actually going to see when they walk into a voting booth or get their absentee ballot,\" he said.\n\nAfter Election Day\n\nIf either candidate drops out between Election Day and Inauguration Day, what happens next depends on whether the electoral college has already met to attest to the election results. These are later sent to the Senate for certification of the ballot.\n\nIn some states, laws require electors to vote for the winning candidate. If the declared winner drops out before the electoral college meets, these legislatures may have to change the rules so the electors' votes bound to the winner would still count for another candidate.\n\nFortier said both parties can urge electors to vote for a certain candidate in the case where the original winner is incapacitated. But the Supreme Court in 2020 ruled that states can require presidential electors to vote for the candidate they pledged to support. If they don't, the elector could be removed and replaced by another.\n\n\"You could tell those electors to vote for somebody ... but maybe that new person hasn't even really faced the American people,\" Fortier said.\n\nIt becomes one of the most unclear scenarios if the president-elect becomes incapacitated in the weeks after the electors vote in mid-December but before Congress certifies the election results, Fortier said.\n\nThe responsibility then falls to Congress to count the votes and it is unclear how Congress would handle counting votes for a certain candidate who is no longer in the picture.\n\n\"It's just harder to see what the outcome is. That's why I say it's a very murky and very confusing period of time for something to happen,\" Fortier said.\n\nDuring the weeks after Congress counts the votes and before Inauguration Day, a winning candidate's running mate becomes the president and will be inaugurated in the case of the president-elect becoming unable to serve.\n\nWhat happens if Trump is convicted?\n\nAs for Trump's legal proceedings, there are no procedures or rules that would legally bar the former president from serving a second term if he is prosecuted, convicted or serving jail time.\n\nUntil recently, the idea that a presidential candidate would be convicted or in prison would be disqualifying among voters, Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, said. But regardless of the norms, there is nothing illegal about it.\n\n\"We're headed toward this really uncharted situation,\" he said.\n\nIt has happened before. In 1920, socialist candidate Eugene Debs ran for president while serving a 10-year prison sentence for sedition. Debs received nearly 1 million votes.\n\nEdelson said while there is no realistic chance Trump will be in prison in 2025, he could be convicted over the course of the next year.\n\n\"There's plenty of time for a trial to take place,\" he said.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, it's unclear if the delegates bound to the former president are required to vote for him if he doesn't drop out of the race, which he has repeatedly indicated he will not do.\n\nIndividual states may unbind delegates from a candidate, but only if they withdraw from running, according to RNC rules.\n\n\"Whoever the voters choose is the appropriate nominee,\" RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said on CNN’s \"State of the Union\" in November when asked if Trump would be the appropriate nominee for the Republican party if convicted. \"As party chair, I’m going to support who the voters choose. And, yes, if they choose Donald Trump.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}]}

Women strategically used gossip to target a rival who posed either a direct or indirect threat.\n\nA direct threat included another woman trying to steal a boyfriend. Indirect threats involved women who were otherwise innocent but physically attractive or provocatively dressed.\n\nFor example, one study directed an attractive woman to wear two very different clothing styles and, in each case, share the same prurient details about her sexual activity to female participants, even though the disclosure could be devastating to her reputation.\n\nReynolds discovered that women who heard this damaging information were more likely to spread it when the speaker wore a low-cut shirt flaunting cleavage than when she dressed conservatively.\n\nNo biases?\n\nHer findings, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, also discovered highly competitive women spread negative information about their same-sex peers indiscriminately.\n\n“This pattern suggests competitive females may be the primary perpetrators of adolescent bullying and then harmful workplace rumors,” Reynolds said.\n\nIn the age of social media, using gossip as a weapon is an easy, potentially powerful technique to harm someone’s reputation. Reynolds hopes shining a light on the behavior is the first step to curtailing it.\n\n“If school counselors know the predictors of female bullying, and they understand it manifests in subtle ways like gossiping, then they’ll be better equipped to detect it and deal with it,” Reynolds said. “This research shows adult women demonstrate similar behaviors of adolescent bullies, and manipulating reputations can have serious consequences.”\n\nBut what are the consequences?\n\nThe research confirmed consequences can be far-reaching because people often choose friends and romantic partners based on reputations. The study found gossip can make female targets seem less moral, untrustworthy or someone to be avoided.\n\n“Reputation-harming information is not spread just by the people we interact with,” Reynolds said. “In a modern environment with social media, this information can spread much more broadly and affect others’ interpretations of us, even if we’ve never met. This issue is more important than ever.”\n\nThis kind of female romantic rivalry is documented throughout history and across cultures. Past research has found examples of women competing over men’s romantic commitment in 91 percent of 137 cultures.\n\nResearchers concluded from historical analyses that the stakes were high for women to attract and retain high-quality men. Data showed fathers of high social status, who remained married and active in their children’s lives, produced healthier children who were more likely to survive into adulthood compared to low-income fathers who did not commit to their children’s mothers.\n\n“Historically, a woman’s romantic partner was a strong predictor of how well the family fared,” Reynolds said. “Today, it may be less predictive because women have better access to education, employment and child support. But going from a dual to single-income household still reduces resources available to children, and divorce can be incredibly stressful. So, attracting and retaining an invested male partner still influences important outcomes for women and their families.”\n\nOne unexpected finding of the study, Reynolds said, was that sometimes women shared gossip about an attractive woman, perceived as a threat, whether they liked her or not.\n\n“That makes me think women don’t really know they’re doing it, or they’re not doing it maliciously,” Reynolds said. “If you can spread gossip without seeming mean, or if you phrase it with concern, such as, ‘I am worried about her because she’s not making good choices,’ then the gossiper is perceived as a better friend, compared to one who gossips maliciously. She can preserve her reputation while still harming a rival’s. That suggests concerned gossip is an effective tactic, and women may not even consciously know they’re doing it.”\n\nApplying the findings\n\nReynolds hopes her work enhances women’s same-sex friendships by raising awareness of gossiping tendencies. If the findings prompt women to pause and consider whether a friend would want certain details disclosed, then that moment of reflection could help prevent the kind of loyalty breaches that undermine friendships.\n\nMost importantly, she believes the findings can elevate a discussion about women’s value outside the realm of romance and physical appearance.\n\n“I hope we can create a new form of success for women that has nothing to do with whether they have romantic partners or whether they’re physically attractive,” Reynolds said. “If we reduce the emphasis on competition for romance and better appreciate that a woman does not need a man to be successful, if we change our view of what it means to be a successful female and stop focusing on questions like, ‘Am I attractive to men,’ maybe that would reduce gossiping, make women feel more secure in themselves, and place more value on other qualities, such as intelligence or kindness.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/03/sesame-street-year-of-kindness/96115256/", "title": "As research shows 'unkind' world for kids, 'Sesame Street' rolls out ...", "text": "Greg Toppo\n\nUSATODAY\n\nJust in time on Sesame Street this season: kindness rules.\n\nThe show — its 47th season premieres Saturday on HBO — focuses this year on kindness in all its permutations. The move follows a spate of recent research, including a wide-ranging Sesame Workshop survey of parents and teachers last October that found more than two-thirds of parents often worry that the world is “an unkind place for my child.” Among teachers, the figure was 86%.\n\nAbout half of teachers said being kind “is not a priority” to most people.\n\nBuried deep in the findings was an indicator that suggested parents might unintentionally contribute to the kindness crisis. Researchers asked a series of either/or questions, including this one: “Which is more important, having manners or having empathy?”\n\nManners won in a landslide: 58% of parents said manners were more important, while 41% rated empathy higher (1% said they didn’t know).\n\nThe new season comes as part of a larger bid to bring kindness front and center — and to be intentional about it, said Rosemarie Truglio, a researcher who oversees content and curriculum for the show.\n\n“Our world is a very complicated world, and we know that kindness is in all of us,” she said. “But for really young children, I think we have to model it.”\n\nKey to the lessons will be putting characters in one another's shoes.\n\n“That’s hard for kids,” Truglio said. “They don’t have the cognitive abilities to do that.”\n\nRecent research has shown “self-regulation” and other “pro-social” behaviors, when displayed in children, are good predictors of health, financial stability and educational achievement later in life. But kids need not only adults to model the behaviors, Sesame researchers say — they need ample time to practice them.\n\nKindness is one of the three bedrock principles of Sesame Workshop, the New York-based educational nonprofit behind the show. Its mission statement is to help children grow “smarter, stronger and kinder.” But until now, the show has never called out kindness specifically.\n\n“It’s part of our DNA,” Truglio said. “I just wanted to make it a little bit more explicit. I wanted to get beyond the niceness of manners — and I really wanted to empower children.”\n\nSo the new season will not only model kind behaviors — it’ll explicitly label kindness when it happens, employing a kind of instant replay and color commentary during moments when characters are kind to one another.\n\nEpisodes will also feature a “kindness cam” segment in which kids imitate behaviors from the show.\n\n“It’s repeated in many of the episodes, time after time, which helps underline the message and the behavior,” said Brown Johnson, the show’s creative director and executive producer.\n\nShe said kindness can be taught at an early age, “but you really have to be specific about it and model it.”\n\nThe new season debuts as Americans' attitudes about self-improvement shift a bit. After a raucous presidential election season, the No. 1 New Year's resolution in 2017 isn't \"losing weight\" or \"exercising more,\" a new Marist poll finds. It's \"being a better person.\"\n\nThat vow knocked weight loss from the No. 1 spot for the first time since 2014, according to the findings. In 2016, \"being a better person\" came in sixth among people who make New Year's resolutions, between \"improving one’s health\" and \"eating healthier.\"\n\nJohnson pointed out that planning for the new season began more than 18 months ago, well before last fall’s fraught election kicked into high gear. So we can’t blame that spectacle. But even before the election, she said, world events were forcing us all to look at things differently.\n\nShe noted that many of the news stories of refugees from places like Syria over the past few years have focused on children and their perilous path to safety. “Not to be political, but we all could stand to see life from somebody else’s point of view,” Johnson said.\n\nFollow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/18/ut-study-kids-exposed-lead-can-become-mean-cranky-adults/7985130002/", "title": "Kids exposed to lead can become mean, cranky adults, UT study finds", "text": "Sucking on a silvery chunk of lead as a kid can, decades later, cause you to be mean and self-centered.\n\nWhile it might sound like a prophecy from a witch, this bizarre fact was the primary finding of a massive University of Texas study examining the effects of lead exposure on people’s personalities.\n\nThe study, published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, investigated the impact of lead on more than 1.5 million people in the United States and Europe. It found that lead exposure was linked to being less agreeable and less considerate as well as other personality issues.\n\nThough people today have much less exposure to lead than in the past, thousands are found to have unsafe blood lead levels every year in Texas. The study highlights just how pernicious this metal can be, even at low levels.\n\nTed Schwaba, a postdoctoral researcher in the psychology department at UT, was the lead author of the study. He said that though we’ve known for decades that lead can stunt our cognition and even result in increases in crime, his study was the first to find that people all over the world experience personality problems as a direct result of exposure to lead.\n\n“It's not just, ‘Hey, if I had some lead exposure, I might be more likely to drop out of school,’ ” he said. Instead, when lead gets into our bodies it seems to affect who we are at our core and how we interact in the world.\n\nThe United States has made huge strides in reducing the prevalence of lead over the past 50 years, but recent events in Flint, Mich., and elsewhere demonstrate that lead poisoning is still a pressing modern concern.\n\nAccording to the Texas Department of State Health Services, more than 4,000 Texas children had elevated blood lead levels in 2019, the most recent year data were available. And that’s only counting the 13% of children who were tested in the state.\n\nThe lead concentrations in these children are low by historical standards, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no safe level of exposure to lead, which, like cobra venom, is a potent neurotoxin.\n\nWhile adults are susceptible to lead poisoning too, toddlers are at higher risk in part because they frequently put objects from their environment into their mouths. This can be a particular problem in homes with lead paint that chips and flakes.\n\n“That’s particularly bad for children in older housing because lead paint chips are sweet,” said Fatima Frausto, a member of the Blood Lead Surveillance Branch of the Texas Department of State Health Services. “They pick it up; they put it in their mouth; they like it; they eat more of it.”\n\nFrausto said other potential sources of exposure in Texas include older lead pipes used to carry drinking water, jewelry, lead residue at industrial sites and even certain spices.\n\nAustinites have a lower risk of lead exposure from water pipes than people living in older cities because much of the piping infrastructure in Austin was built after the use of lead was phased out starting a half-century ago.\n\nMatt Cullen, division manager of distribution system engineering with Austin Water, said his team is conducting a full inventory of where lead exists in the system. They have found a few lead pipes, but all have been replaced.\n\n“In Austin, very rarely do we see lead in customers’ water,” he said. “Austin was progressive in eliminating lead as a material to be used much ahead of the rest of the country and proactive in removing it when found.”\n\nStill, more than 150 children in Travis County were found with elevated blood lead levels in 2019, the most recent year with available data, and that lead comes from somewhere.\n\nStudies have shown that lead concentrations are highest in lower-income communities that are disproportionately situated near industrial sites. Earlier this year, an illegal dumping site with elevated lead levels in a mostly Black and Latino neighborhood in South Dallas called Shingle Mountain was finally cleaned up.\n\nSchwaba said he hopes one of the effects of his research will be to bring attention to the disproportionate impact lead has on certain communities.\n\n“Every time people look at how bad it is, they find it’s worse and worse,” he said. Yet “there's still a lot of lead in the soil and lead in pipes, and it’s still exposing pockets of people to huge amounts of lead.”\n\nFor his study, Schwaba and his team used data from an online personality quiz taken by millions of people. They then matched each person’s personality profile from the quiz to data about their lead exposure based on where they grew up as a child. For their study, they selected a sample of responses from 269 counties in the United States and 37 European countries.\n\nThey found that people from areas with higher lead exposure had more negative personality profiles. Specifically, they were less agreeable and conscientious, and sometimes more neurotic.\n\nThe research team then examined how the personality profiles shifted as different U.S. counties began limiting exposure to lead starting in the 1970s, largely as a result of the Clean Air Act’s regulations on leaded gasoline. They found that people born after lead levels started to decline in the county where they grew up had healthier and more mature personalities as adults, as recorded by the personality quiz.\n\nBecause different counties in the U.S. stopped using leaded gasoline at different times between 1970 and the early ’90s, the personality differences observed by this study can’t simply be because of a particular generation being “nicer” or “meaner,” Schwaba explained. The researchers also controlled for participants’ income and age.\n\nSchwaba estimated that the societal costs of more negative personality traits can derive from people who are anxious or less conscientious and thus have higher health care expenses.\n\nWhile the personality differences were small for most people, Schwaba said they can still have an impact.\n\n“If I'm just a little bit friendlier, that's probably tens of arguments I've missed over my life, maybe one or two extra friends that I have, one relative who likes me a little bit more,” he said.\n\nGet the lead out\n\nIf you think you or your child has been exposed to lead or you want more information on limiting your exposure to lead, you can call the Blood Lead Surveillance Group at 800-588-1248.\n\nIf you’re concerned about lead in your drinking water, you can schedule a free test with Austin Water by calling 311.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/health/acts-of-kindness-health-benefits-wellness/index.html", "title": "Health benefits of a random act of kindness | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nSpreading kindness not only helps others feel better about themselves — it can also boost the giver’s health and happiness, according to research. It’s a win-win for all.\n\nPutting the well-being of others before our own without expecting anything in return — or what is called being altruistic — stimulates the reward centers of the brain, studies have shown. Those feel-good chemicals flood our system, producing a sort of “helper’s high.” Volunteering, for example, has been shown to minimize stress and improve depression.\n\nLonger life, anyone?\n\nThat’s not all: The same activity can also reduce the risk for cognitive impairment and even help us live longer. One reason for this, experts say, is because kindness contributes to our sense of community and belonging. And that, studies have found, is a key contributor to a healthy, longer life.\n\nLower blood pressure\n\nGiving donations to others, or “prosocial spending,” has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health. One study asked a group of hypertensive people to spend $40 on themselves, while another group of people with high blood pressure were told to spend the money on others.\n\nThey found that those who spent money on others had lower blood pressure at the end of the six-week study. In fact, the benefits were as large as those from healthy diet and exercise.\n\nPain reduction\n\nGiving seems to lessen our pain. A recent study found that people who said they would donate money to help orphans were less sensitive to an electric shock than those who declined to give. In addition, the more helpful people thought their donation would be, the less pain they felt.\n\nHow could this happen? The study found that regions of the brain that react to painful stimulation appear to be instantly deactivated by the experience of giving.\n\nHappiness\n\nIn the UK, researchers found that being kind could boost happiness in as little as three days. The study assigned people to three groups: the first group had to do an act of kindness each day; the second group tried a new activity; and the third group did nothing. The groups who were kind and did novel things saw a significant boost in happiness.\n\nSpreading kindness doesn't have to be complicated. PeopleImages/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nYou’ll experience even greater joy if you’re creative with your acts of kindness. Happiness researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky and Kennon Sheldon found that people who did a variety of acts of kindness throughout the week showed greater increases in happiness than those who performed the same activity over and over again.\n\nAnd here’s the good news: It seems acts of kindness can be anonymous or visible, spontaneous or planned, and can be as simple as giving a compliment or opening a door for someone.\n\nKindness suggestions\n\nOK, you’re convinced and want to jump right into being a kinder and more helpful person. There are literally hundreds of ideas on the internet, but here are a few to get you started:\n\nWhile driving, make room for the car that wants to enter your lane.\n\nGive a genuine compliment to a family member, friend or colleague.\n\nDo the same for your boss — they probably never get compliments!\n\nLet go of a grudge and tell that person you forgive them (unless telling them makes it worse).\n\nBe there for a friend having a tough time. Don’t try to fix it; just listen.\n\nLeave your mail carrier a thank-you note.\n\nOvertip your delivery person.\n\nBut I’m so tired\n\nThat’s more than fair. Many people are struggling economically and are often overcome with balancing the needs of family, work and community. Consider being kind to yourself (in whatever way that means to you) as well as others. We all need a break.\n\nWant more ideas? The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, which promotes kindness all year, has lists of kindness ideas, organized by work, community, environment, animals, strangers, kids, seniors and more.\n\n“You’re making the world a better place,” the foundation says.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight.

It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/health/phage-superbug-killer-life-itself-wellness/index.html", "title": "Superbug crisis: How a woman saved her husband's life | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.\n\nAfter months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.\n\n“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’\n\n“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”\n\nStrathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nWhat she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.\n\nThen she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.\n\nNext, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.\n\nYet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.\n\nTheir story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.\n\n“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28 - Source: CNN How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28\n\nA terrifying vacation\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.\n\nFound in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”\n\n“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”\n\nToday, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.\n\n“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”\n\nWith the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”\n\nPatterson's body was systemically infected with a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that also infected troops in the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname \"Iraqibacter.\" Steffanie Strathdee\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack\n\nAfter that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nA phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.\n\n“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”\n\nBuoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.\n\nOne stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.\n\n“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”\n\n‘No problem’\n\nWhile the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.\n\nBut the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”\n\nIn fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.\n\nDr. Robert \"Chip\" Schooley (left) and Dr. Randy Taplitz after injecting Patterson with the first round of phages at UC San Diego Medical Center. Carly DeMento\n\nBack in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.\n\n“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”\n\nPurifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”\n\nMore hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.\n\n“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.\n\n“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”\n\n‘It was just miraculous’\n\nThe purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.\n\n“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”\n\nTwo days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.\n\n“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\n“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”\n\nPatterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nDamaged but not broken\n\nToday, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.\n\n“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.\n\n“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”\n\nTo prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.\n\n“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.\n\n“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”\n\nA legacy\n\n\"The Perfect Predator\" is a blow-by-blow account by the couple of the fight to save Patterson's life. Hachette Books\n\nPatterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.\n\n“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\nSome of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.\n\n“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.\n\nIn San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.\n\nSchooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.\n\nAnd a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19 - Source: CNN How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19\n\n“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”\n\nStrathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.\n\n“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’\n\n“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/21/pueblo-county-commissioner-accuses-needle-exchange-of-drug-promotion/69916919007/", "title": "Pueblo County Commissioner accuses needle exchange of 'drug ...", "text": "A Pueblo County commissioner is accusing a local needle exchange program of \"drug promotion\" and seeking more government regulation of such programs in Pueblo.\n\nCommissioner Eppie Griego is making the push for more oversight after he discovered a kit and promotional materials supplied to drug users by a local nonprofit. The kit offers tools and safety information for snorting illegal drugs and promotes that method as \"safe,\" according to a news release issued Tuesday by the county.\n\n\"Access Point Pueblo, a local nonprofit needle-exchange program, is apparently providing a kit to clients that claims inhaling drugs that 'easily dissolve in water' is safe. In fact, the nonprofit not only provides instructions, saline vials and tubes necessary to inhale drugs, it says that when using fentanyl, 'be sure to go low and slow,'\" the county said in its release.\n\nAccess Point Pueblo's Health Hub Program Manager Sarah Money explained the intent of the kit.\n\n\"Though no drug use can be classified as 'safe,' research shows snorting drugs, versus injecting drugs, decreases risk of overdose and infectious disease transmission,\" Money said. \"Access Point strives to help people who are using drugs reduce harms by providing supplies, education and safety tips.\"\n\nMoney explained that the “low and slow” technique highlighted in the kit \"is employed as an overdose prevention tip, particularly when fentanyl is suspected to be laced into the drug.\" She said the agency's data indicates there has been a decrease \"in injection drug use over the past year, primarily due to education.\"\n\nMore public safety news: Pueblo needle exchange founder wants to prevent overdoses with drug testing device\n\nThe goal of decreasing drug use in the county is important for officials on both sides of the issue. Statistics show Pueblo County has seen a recent increase in drug overdose deaths. According to the county's release, the increase in overdose deaths is, in part, due to increased usage of fentanyl.\n\nIn 2019, 55 people in the county died from a drug overdose, but by 2021 that number grew to 73. Health officials expect the number could increase again in 2022 after the coroner concludes his annual reports, according to the county's release.\n\nGriego seeks more oversight, no county funding for programs\n\nGriego, according to the county's release, \"vows to take steps to license and monitor the nonprofits who provide needle exchange programs.\"\n\n“We put so many resources into stopping drug use in the community,” Griego said. “This material (from Access Point) crosses the line between harm reduction and drug promotion — all at the expense of our children and our community.”\n\n“Our work is about community health and saving lives,” said Darrell Vigil, CEO of Colorado Health Network, which oversees Access Point Pueblo and four other harm reduction programs across the state. “In Pueblo, our Access Point participants reported 511 overdose reversals last year alone.\"\n\nAccess Point Pueblo has operated locally since 2014 and received the required approval from the Pueblo County Board of Health before starting work locally, according to a Colorado Health Network statement to the Chieftain. The Pueblo County Department of Public Health and Environment declined to comment on the issue.\n\n“Our harm reduction programs are designed to achieve three major goals: reduce or prevent the spread of HIV andother blood borne conditions; prevent overdose deaths via the provision of Narcan, fentanyl test strips and overdose prevention education; and build relationships with program participants so that when they are ready for treatment, we facilitate linkage-to-care with culturally competent programs,” Vigil said in the statement.\n\nThe Pueblo County Board of Commissioners, according to the county's release, \"is taking steps to ensure that any nonprofit promoting needle exchanges will not receive county money. Access Point currently receives public funding from the state of Colorado but does not receive money from Pueblo County, while its counterpart, Southern Colorado Harm Reduction, has received county funding in the past.\"\n\nGriego \"believes public funding should never be used to promote illegal drug use,\" according to the release. He also expressed concern about a lack of regular inspections.\n\n“I am going to seek ways of regulating and licensing for these types of operations,” he said. \"It appears these businesses have less oversight than a coffee shop.\"\n\nAccess Point Pueblo is funded, in part, through the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and follows oversight standards set forth by that department, including monthly reporting. Colorado Health Network also provides monthly data to the Pueblo Department of Public Health, according to its statement.\n\n“I spoke with local law enforcement officials, and there is long-standing concern with the practice involving the needle exchange programs in our community,\" Griego said in the release. \"Law enforcement has been supportive in evaluating their activities on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nHowever, Colorado Health Network reported in its statement that the agency \"regularly meets with community partners in all cities where it operates, including health and police departments, to ensure accountability to the community.\"\n\n“I don’t know a family that hasn’t been affected by substance use and addiction. The people we serve are someone’sson or daughter, mother or father,\" Vigil said.\n\n\"They represent every walk of life — white collar professionals, athletes, the homeless and sex workers to name a few. Regardless of the position they hold in society they deserve to be treated with dignity and humanity,” Vigil said.\n\nIn addition to harm reduction services, Colorado Health Network also links participants to free testing for HIV, Hepatitis C and other health conditions and provides some food items, hats, gloves and other clothing items to those in need.\n\n“We work alongside people who use substances and truly meet them where they are. We show kindness andcompassion to some of the most stigmatized people in our communities as we help reduce harm and work towardpositive changes in their lives,\" Vigil said.\n\n\"It can be a slow process, but it’s been proven to be a successful approach across the country and globally.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, syringe service programs are “proven and effective.”\n\n“Nearly 30 years of research has shown that comprehensive syringe service programs are safe, effective and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections,” according to the CDC website.\n\n“Research shows that new users of syringe service programs are five times more likely to enter drug treatment and about three times more likely to stop using drugs than those who don’t use the programs,\" according to the CDC. The needle exchanges that provide naloxone \"also help decrease opioid overdose death and help protect the public and first responders by facilitating the safe disposal of used needles and syringes.\"\n\nNeedles in public places\n\nGriego said community members also have expressed concern about used syringes being left in public places such as parks. He said he is considering a pilot program to monitor where the syringes are coming from, according to the county's press release.\n\n“I understand the practicality of harm reduction through clean syringe access,” Griego said in the release. “However, the large assumption in our community is that these needles are exchanged and not left in public areas — I want accountability.”\n\nIn 2021, Access Point Pueblo distributed 767,980 syringes and had 545,551 returned for a 71% return rate, Money said. In 2022, 648,900 syringes were distributed and 363,846 or 56% were collected.\n\n\"Noting the dip in return rates, we proactively conducted surveys with program participants and learned that they dispose of used sharps at other syringe access programs and by properly disposing of them in a hard plastic container labeled biohazard and at other locations such as pharmacies,\" Money said. \"Over the course of the year, we completed 15 pickups or cleanups in the community, getting a total of 336 syringes off our streets and safely disposed of.\"\n\n\"We have worked with 24 area businesses to see if they were experiencing issues with improperly disposed of sharps and equip those who were with safe disposal containers. We distributed 23 containers for safe storage and eventual disposal with us,\" Money said.\n\nTo further increase and ease the return of sharps, Access Point Pueblo has procured and has plans to install a large disposal kiosk that should be up and running during the second quarter of 2023 at its Pueblo location.\n\nPueblo Parks and Recreation Director Steven Meier said his clean up and park crews picked up 1,600 discarded needles in 2020, 2,516 in 2021 and 2,168 in 2022. He said the drop in discarded needles may be attributed to the fact that \"there are more groups out in the community that pick up needles.\"\n\nAccess Point Pueblo, located at 807 N. Greenwood St., Suite 200, offers its needle exchange program from 10 a.m. to noon and 1:30-4 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday and 7-9 p.m. every Wednesday.\n\nMore needle exchange news: Debate over needle exchanges dominates Pueblo City Council work session on drug use\n\nChieftain reporter Tracy Harmon covers business news.

I routinely assess situations and develop plans for how they could be better, more strategic, more efficient.\n\nThough my assessments start-off as well-meaning, they sometimes turn into critical thoughts. It can be uncomfortable to self-reflect and see my own lack of gratitude towards others. I appreciate this time of year when gratitude is front and center. It is a good reminder for me, especially before heading into the Christmas season, of all I truly do have to be thankful for.\n\nOne of my most life-altering experiences was visiting Haiti to serve for a week with missionaries at Many Hands for Haiti. We met many beautiful people and were able to help provide them with basic needs.\n\nThese included food (including rice, beans and oi), housing (helping tradesmen pour concrete floors in place of dirt floors in two-room cement block houses) and transportation (we assembled mobility carts to assist people unable to walk to the village well to get water).\n\nThe basics. The essentials.\n\nEveryone we served was grateful. And these communities, though filled with the poorest of the poor in the entire world, were overflowing with joy and kindness.\n\nI was not an education major in college, but I did take a teaching methods class while a student at Ohio State University. This is when I first learned about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow was a psychologist who proposed a whole host of basic survival and social needs must be met before anyone can reach their full potential.\n\nHis theorized pyramid has five levels. The base is physiological needs like food, water and shelter. Then comes safety and security through health and family. Next is love and belonging with friendships and social connections. The fourth level is self-esteem and includes confidence, achievement and respect of others. The top of the pyramid is self-actualization when someone can experience purpose, meaning and inner potential.\n\nIntuitively this makes sense. When someone is hungry or sick or sleep-deprived, they should not be physically or mentally capable of focusing on learning or contributing to society. But I love thinking of the examples where this simple math doesn’t fit. They are the stories of fairytales and real life heroes. The Cinderellas who serve with kindness and the responders who sacrifice and still have the strength to put others’ needs first. These are the examples I witnessed in Haiti. People rising above their terrible and often unjust circumstances and fining ways to be grateful, content and loving.\n\nGratitude is like a secret power that combats jealousy, envy and selfishness. In a recent article and gratitude research, Imed Bouchrika shares gratitude is more than a natural response. It can be developed as a habit through practice and exercises. Some proven ways to increase gratitude include small acts of kindness (especially towards family and close friends) and writing notes or letters of genuine appreciation.\n\nThe benefits are very real. Cultivating gratitude improves sleep, helps to lower blood pressure, prevents overeating, strengthens the immune system, improves pain tolerance and extends the lifespan. Besides physical health benefits, there are also many mental, psychological and spiritual health benefits. Gratitude improves patience and resiliency and can make us less materialistic. Research also shows gratitude is a core factor that plays a role in the forgiveness process.\n\nLet’s not let Thanksgiving escape without focusing on thanksgiving. I am grateful for you, reader, and for the community in which we live. Happy Thanksgiving to you.\n\nToday, I’ll leave you with this quote from Maya Angelou: \"When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.\"\n\nEmily Marrison is an OSU Extension Family & Consumer Sciences Educator and may be reached at 740-622-2265.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/education/952209/how-schools-can-support-childrens-mental-health", "title": "How schools can support children's mental health | The Week", "text": "This article first appeared in The Week Independent Schools Guide 2021\n\nThe pandemic has taken its toll on young people’s mental health and wellbeing. Research commissioned by NHS Digital found that one in six children and young people experienced a mental health difficulty in 2020, compared with one in nine in 2017, while an Ofsted report revealed that the children hardest hit by school closures and restrictions had regressed in basic skills and learning. Some lost physical fitness while others showed signs of mental distress, including an increase in eating disorders and self-harm.\n\nDeborah Woodman, a consultant clinical psychologist at Evelina London, one of only two specialist children’s hospitals in London, says children have expressed an increase in “general sadness” and worry during the crisis. While younger children were less able to articulate their worries and sometimes exhibited physical symptoms like tummy pains and headaches, older children talked about feeling lonely and missing their friends.\n\n“It was very much the hope that the reopening of schools in September would have a stabilising effect and for some young people that was indeed the case,” says Dr Woodman. “But for other young people the increased anxiety about being out in the community and at school resulted in an increase in mental health difficulty.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It’s linked to academic excellence because you don’t really get one without the other.”\n\nWriting in The Sunday Times, Lord Layard, the economist and co-author of Can We Be Happier?, and former cabinet secretary Lord O’Donnell took a similar view. “If you want to predict if a child will become a happy adult, the best predictor is not their qualifications but their emotional health,” they said.\n\nIt’s clear that schools have a crucial role to play in looking after young people’s emotional health, building their resilience and giving them the skills to cope with the challenges of the pandemic.\n\nSt Chris, a day and boarding school in Letchworth Garden City, has devised an initiative called GRIT (it stands for guts, resilience, initiative and tenacity) while Cumnor House Sussex, a co-ed prep school near Haywards Heath, has introduced its pioneering iSpace Wellbeing curriculum.\n\nCreated and developed in 2017 by Paula Talman, director of compliance, health and welfare at Cumnor House Sussex, and aimed at children aged four to 11, iSpace Wellbeing offers a child-friendly approach to wellbeing education. It is taught through the school’s PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education) timetable and encourages pupils to talk about their feelings and to know how and when to ask for help. iSpace stands for “I stop, pause and calm everything”.\n\nYear 7 and 8 pupils have their own bespoke curriculum, #iWonder, which helps them to understand their emotional, physical, social and mental health. The school is currently trialling a Wellbeing Compass app to help them review their wellbeing, put together self-care tools and develop coping strategies at school and at home.\n\nDuring the first lockdown, Cumnor House Sussex ensured that every child had a wellbeing session every week. “We carried on remotely and if anybody wanted a private conversation we booked that in as well,” says Mrs Talman. She believes that developing resilience – the ability to get through difficult or testing times – is important for all age groups so resilience training is part of\n\niSpace Wellbeing and #iWonder. “We teach resilience in a child-friendly way so they can take the concepts on board,” she says. “At the age of four they are introduced to the concept of resilience using a story about learning to ride a bike. You fall off but each time you fall off you learn something new. You become resourceful and you get back on. You keep progressing and you feel great.”\n\nThe children also learn about the successes and failures of people like basketball player Michael Jordan, writer JK Rowling and adventurer Bear Grylls, all of whom have spoken publicly about the failures they experienced before going on to be successful.\n\nHandcross Park, a co-ed prep school for two to 13-year-olds in rural West Sussex, also uses the iSpace Wellbeing programme and sees it as a helpful way for children to articulate their feelings.\n\nWhen the country went into the first lockdown the school asked its 380 pupils to record how they were feeling emotionally and physically in an online wellbeing journal. Children in years 4 and below talked to their tutors every day and the older children had PSHE time every afternoon.\n\n“The children found the wellbeing journal very positive,” says Richard Clark, director of studies at Handcross Park. “A year 8 pupil told us: ‘You’ll never know how important it was to me. It really was a lifesaver.’ We also asked them to try and do a good deed each day and to identify something that they felt gratitude for.”\n\nIn September 2020 the school produced a questionnaire, asking the children about their self-esteem and their feelings about returning to school. The school prefects launched HXPTV, a TV channel that covers everything from mindfulness to how the brain works. The wellbeing prefect, a year 8 pupil, started an agony aunt service, answering light-hearted questions from younger children.Mr Clark is convinced that the pandemic has made the pupils more resilient. “Given the right tools, they showed they have the ability to adapt exceptionally well,” he says. “In a recent assembly I showed them a 1797 penny because I wanted to talk about the importance of valuing and cherishing the small things in life – which again is great for the wellbeing message.”\n\nRather than talking to children about “resilience”, Jonny Timms, headmaster of Walhampton, a co-ed day and boarding prep school in Lymington, Hampshire, prefers to use the term “bouncing back”.\n\n“Bouncing back – the idea of weathering difficulties and learning from them – is more meaningful to a child,” he says. “If 2020 showed us anything it’s that we can’t predict the challenges that lie ahead so children need to become confident, resilient problem-solvers – and those skills are definitely teachable. Our staff are brilliant at encouraging our pupils to have a go at things. During lockdown in January they encouraged the children to build their own shelters, cook on a camp fire and then make a video to show the learning journey they had been on. They absolutely loved it.”\n\nTeaching resilience is equally important for secondary pupils. At University College School (UCS) in Hampstead, north west London, resilience is one of the school’s four learning values, along with responsibility, relationships and resourcefulness. The school defines resilience as “approaching your learning with confidence, never giving up and always motivating and challenging yourself to become a better learner.”\n\n“We are a highly selective school and we are never complacent about exam outcomes but we don’t want to be slaves to them,” explains Mark English, the school’s vice master and academic director. “We want to give our students an educational experience that is future-proof so we help them to develop strengths that will be useful in later life, not just enable them to pass exams in order to get them into the next stage of their education.”\n\nWhen the school switched to online learning during lockdown, UCS staff took a series of steps to look after pupils’ mental health and wellbeing. They built in five-minute breaks between lessons so everyone could get offscreen, walk about and get a drink and snack. Teachers stopped all homework for years 7 to 10 and gave pupils more time during morning registration to interact, socialise and talk to each other and their tutors.\n\nStrategies like these proved so successful that when pupils returned the school decided to keep the longer registration times and five-minute breaks between lessons. “It isn’t a headlong rush from 9am to 4pm anymore,” says Mr English. “We have tried to get a greater sense of balance and a less frenetic sense to the school day. Pastorally, our decision to give form tutors far more time with their forms is something we have preserved too.”\n\nIn his view the current cohort of pupils have become more resilient during the past year. “They think their way round obstacles and problems,” he says. “They are open to advice but they are very solution-focused and phlegmatic about things that crop up. They seem to be much more flexible in their mindset and able to think their way round things.”\n\nFor Mike Lamb, director of staff and pupil wellbeing at Hurst College, a co-ed day and boarding school for 1,200 pupils aged four to 18 in West Sussex, resilience is often learned through co-curricular activities. Rather than simply running online academic lessons during lockdown the school organised a full co-curricular programme and sport three times a week.\n\n“For me, developing resilience is about providing pupils with lots of opportunities to do things they are good at and build their self-esteem and things they might not be so good at but help them to learn from the experience,” says Mr Lamb, who teaches biology and psychology.\n\n“It’s about providing opportunities to succeed but, if they fail, putting them in a position where they can fail but still feel safe and supported. It’s also about having an ethos in school where everybody has a go. For example every pupil who joins us in year 9 will do dance. It helps to develop the ethos where it’s important to try but it’s important to fail.”\n\nMatt Bull, deputy head (boarding and external relations) at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire, points out that even though resilience is a buzzword in the education world these days it’s something that has always existed in schools.\n\n“Resilience is the ability to keep going and deal with what life throws at you,” he says. “We include it in our PSHE programme but it’s sometimes better taught through something else. For example, being part of a choir and trying to prepare for a service when you’ve got failing AV [audiovisual] equipment and you’re exhausted at the end of term is far more powerful than a one-off lesson on resilience. Or being on the side of a mountain in a Duke of Edinburgh’s Award expedition, cooped up with three people you don’t really know and having to navigate your way back – that’s the kind of resilience that’s often overlooked.”\n\nIn his view young people have been hugely resilient during the past year – “especially if you think about all the things that schoolchildren and university students are being denied right now that were life defining for our generation”.\n\nHe worries, however, about the increasing number of “lawnmower parents” in the world – those who “sit in front of the child and mow the grass before the child has even got on to it”. In other words, parents who try to protect their child from any type of struggle or obstacle.\n\n“When they are at school children need to make mistakes,” says Mr Bull. “They always have done and they always will do. It’s our job as teachers to give them the spades to get out of the holes they have dug. That’s what resilience is all about.”\n\nMindfulness for all\n\nMany schools have introduced mindfulness sessions to support pupils’ mental health and wellbeing, encouraging them to focus on the present by using techniques like meditation, breathing and yoga. Epsom College, for instance, has partnered with the Anna Freud Centre and is taking part in a study on the long-term benefits of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness was introduced six years ago as part of Epsom’s PSHE curriculum and is now practised throughout the school.\n\n“As much as we focused on delivering high-quality remote teaching and learning throughout lockdown and to those forced to self-isolate during the autumn, we also provided a full mindfulness and wellbeing programme remotely,” says headmaster Jay Piggot.\n\n“Once pupils were back at Epsom, we delivered a full timetable of lessons and co-curricular activities. They volunteer their time for community initiatives, such as our virtual befriending service for local care home residents. All of these activities have helped to keep our pupils grounded, appreciative and resilient.”\n\nLet’s give young people a pat on the back\n\nWhen it comes to teaching resilience Jenny Price, deputy head pastoral at Godolphin School, a girls’ school in Salisbury, Wiltshire, thinks “the drip feed approach” works best. “I don’t think you can go into a PSHE lesson and say: ‘We’re going to do resilience today,’” she says. “We prefer to incorporate it into different parts of the curriculum, lessons, assemblies and activities like CCF, yoga and Zumba.”\n\nShe believes that kindness is a fundamental part of resilience – being kind to yourself and being kind to others. “Communication is important too,” she says. “A sign of resilience is knowing when to ask for help and being able to seek the right kind of help. We teach the girls that they’re going to come across things in life that don’t go their way but resilience is all about how they react, how they cope and how they set things right.\n\n“I think this generation will be more resilient than previous generations. They have done amazingly well to crack on and keep positive during these times so let’s give these young people a massive pat on the back. When you ask some of our girls what they want to do in their careers, becoming scientists who can help make things better in the future are among their top jobs.”\n\nDuring the pandemic an enterprising sixth former wrote a list of advice for those suffering with anxiety about Covid and the school posted it on its website. Her tips include the following:\n\nRestrict yourself to reading the news once a day.\n\nCreate structure and make time for friends and exercise.\n\nPlan what you will do when all this is over and focus on self-care.\n\nMake time to talk to someone about your worries but keep it structured and regular.\n\nBreathing techniques are absolutely not over-rated as a coping mechanism for anxiety and stress, so establish your “go to” breathing pattern.

Allan is the editorial director for CNN Travel, Style, Science and Wellness. This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project, to which you can subscribe here.\n\nCNN —\n\nLibrary Shelfie Day – proof that there is now a day of celebration for everything – is the fourth Wednesday of January. It’s a lovely reminder of the heroic civic role libraries play in our lives, related to the massive impact books in general have on our lives.\n\nWhenever I enter someone’s home, I’m drawn to their bookshelves. It’s not a conscious effort; it’s just the part of a house I find most interesting. Seeing someone’s books offers a glimpse of who they are and what they value. It also makes for good ice-breaker conversation. Some people like to snoop through medicine cabinets, but that only gives you insight into a person’s physical well-being. The books tell a tale about the person’s mind.\n\nThis proclivity has paid off for me big-time. Before we started dating, my now-wife, Kate, developed what she called the bookshelf theory of dating. She had met someone at a party in her apartment a couple of years earlier who asked questions about her books, one in particular. That was telling, Kate told her friends; interest in her bookshelf was a quality she wanted in a partner. Years later, on one of our early dates, I brought up the same book, still on her shelf, and she cut me off. “It was you! You were the person who asked me about my books. I developed a whole theory of dating around you!”\n\nOur fate must have been written.\n\nBookshelves have been surprisingly good for me, but they hold tangible benefits for everyone. You may not have a biography written about your life, but you have a personal bibliography. And many of the books you read influence your thoughts and life in often deeper and longer-lasting ways than film, television, music and other attention-grabbing pleasures.\n\n“How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book?” Henry David Thoreau asked rhetorically, referring to nearly everyone. That was long before there were ubiquitous screens, but it’s still true.\n\nBooks as therapy\n\nIf a book can change your life, why leave that to serendipity? The trend toward bibliotherapy – a strategy of seeking books that aid you through difficult times and aspects of your life – is starting to catch on.\n\n“Reading literature can increase a person’s happiness, decrease stress, and unlock the imagination,” is how the website BiblioRemedy described the goals of its bibliotherapy, in which a specialist talks to you about about the issues you’re wrestling with and recommends books to help you sort them out.\n\nElla Berthoud and Susan Elderkin, bibliotherapists at London’s School of Life, have written – what else? – a book on the topic. In “The Novel Cure: An A-Z of Literary Remedies,” they showed how Gabriel García Márquez can help overcome a fear of death and Patricia Highsmith can cure lovesickness.\n\nWe’ve probably all been bibliotherapists at some point. When I meet young people in the midst of their searching-for-the-meaning-of-life stage, I recommend “The Razor’s Edge” by W. Somerset Maugham. For those who’ve seen a thing or two, I’ve given “To Bless the Space Between Us,” John O’Donohue’s poems on the human experience. And for friends who have experienced true tragedy, I have shared Pema Chödrön’s “When Things Fall Apart,” in hopes it may offer them some guidance through their grief.\n\nBooks, and stories in particular, are probably the greatest source of wisdom after experience (as I argued on the TEDx stage, diving deep into the meaning of a single ancient Taoist parable). You aren’t just more knowledgeable the more you read, but you have more insight into life, love and the other big topics that matter most.\n\nReading as exercise\n\nEven when we read for pleasure, we usually learn something (which you can rarely say of entertainment television). “Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body,” wrote the English politician and writer Joseph Addison.\n\nResearch backs this up. “Literacy propels the development of new, neuronal networks in the brain – particularly in specific forms of connectivity between visual and language regions. That, in turn, create the potential for increasingly complex thought,” explained Maryanne Wolf, author of “Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain” and director of the Center for Dyslexia, Diverse Learners, and Social Justice at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.\n\nThe benefits of a lifetime of reading are exponential and have “profound implications for the development of a wide range of cognitive capabilities,” wrote researchers in the Journal of Direct Instruction. The 2001 study showed language acquisition is more impacted outside of formal teaching settings, most profoundly from books. The exposure to vocabulary is so much greater from them than from television or from spoken language that even a preschool book offers more new words than listening to an adult TV show or a conversation between two college-educated adults. Strong early reading skills have also been linked to higher intelligence as adults.\n\nFiction is just as insightful as nonfiction, if not more so. Is there a reference book about love, for example, that is better at capturing its essence than Ian McEwan’s “Atonement”? Tim O’Brien effectively illustrates in “The Things They Carried” that just because something didn’t happen doesn’t mean it’s not true; it may be more true because it’s fiction. And reading fiction enhances connectivity in the brain and improves brain function in ways nonfiction doesn’t, according to researchers at Emory University in a study from 2013.\n\nLet’s not discriminate, though. Nonfiction, fiction, reference books, children’s lit, sci-fi, poetry: All are portals of discovery and meaning. Books, rather than bite-size posts and podcasts, take you spelunking instead of merely peering into the cave.\n\nYour ideal bookshelf\n\nThe impact of books on the lives of people is the inspiration behind a fascinating volume titled “My Ideal Bookshelf,” in which Thessaly La Force interviewed a wide variety of writers and thought leaders, including Malcolm Gladwell, Patti Smith and Ishmael Reed, about the books they value most. Artist Jane Mount then painted their books on a virtual bookshelf to illustrate each profile.\n\nDavid Allan's ideal bookshelf is shown. Courtesy Jane Mount\n\n“The reason I started the project was by looking at people’s bookshelves and thinking about what that taught me about them,” Mount explained. She and La Force agreed it would be fascinating to see the ideal bookshelves of certain people (not necessarily famous ones), so they began asking. And by painting the books those individuals considered their favorites, or the ones that made them who they are, or changed them in some way, it creates what Mount describes as a “portrait from the inside … almost like a book aura.”\n\nMount added, “It’s fascinating that you can take something so basic as a book spine – just a rectangle with words – but it represents so many huge ideas about what’s inside.”\n\nWhat my ideal bookshelf might say about me “Atonement” by Ian McEwen “The Dharma Bums” by Jack Kerouac “The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion” “Everyday Blessings” by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” by Hunter S. Thompson “From Beirut to Jerusalem” by Thomas Friedman “The Garden of Eden” by Ernest Hemingway “The Grapes of Wrath” by John Steinbeck “The Mosquito Coast” by Paul Theroux “Plato: Collected Dialogues” “The Power of Myth” by Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers “The Razor’s Edge” by W. Somerset Maugham “The Religions of Man” by Huston Smith “The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien “The World According to Garp” by John Irving “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee My ideal bookshelf reveals, I think, a seeking or longing for something: the meaning of life, the American dream, a career, adventure, a manifest destiny, a new way of looking at the world, a deeper connection to those I love, and … wisdom. What does yours say about you?\n\nMount’s theory about why books affect us in deeper ways than other media is that “when you’re forced to imagine things, they stick in your brain longer.” And after painting more than 1,000 ideal bookshelves (you can commission your own through her website), she has noticed a trend toward books that formed a strong emotional bond with the reader when they were young. The most recurring book on people’s commissioned bookshelves? Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird,” followed by J.D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye.”\n\nIt’s a fun and insightful exercise to ponder your ideal bookshelf. Which books have influenced you the most? Which volumes make your heart soar or brain buzz? Which do you reread because, at different stages of life, they reveal new insights? Or which ones do you find so enjoyable that you return to immerse yourself in the story again and again? And what do they collectively say about you?\n\nTo e-book or not to E?\n\nAs for e-books, warming your hands over the Kindle is fine, too, arguably useful when traveling and more environmentally friendly. And audiobooks, when well produced, are practically a new art form. But personally, I find there is something less comforting about pixelated and audiobooks, and less satisfying about completing them. They are less read-in-the-bathtub-friendly and more expensive when dropped. There is even research that shows electronic book consumption inhibits reading comprehension and recall, if you want a scientific reason to eschew them.\n\nBut consuming good books is more important than the medium in which you do so.\n\nAnd if you prefer e-books, that’s another argument for maintaining a virtual bookshelf. “People want to own physical books less but they still want a record,” Mount said.\n\nIt was for a similar reason that 20 years ago I began drawing books on a virtual bookshelf of my own.\n\nThe 20-year bookshelf\n\nThe gallery above is my hand drawings of the spines of every* book I’ve read since my last year of college, sketched in various writers’ notebooks I’ve kept over two decades. (*Well, not every kids’ book that I read to my young children, but some of the better ones.) Spines, as Mount points out in her book, are “totally lost in the digital age.”\n\nThe drawings started out as an artistic lark and ended up a literary timeline of my adult life. I love looking them over and seeing the books that jog memories of eras of my life: what I read my middle school students as a reading teacher in Teach For America (including “The Catcher in the Rye”), while living in Dublin (Ann Charters’ “The Portable Beat Reader”), living in San Francisco (“McTeague” by Frank Norris), traveling around the world for a year (Paul Bowles’ “The Sheltering Sky” in Morocco, Vikram Seth’s “A Suitable Boy” on long train rides in India), starting my job at The New York Times (Gay Talese’s “The Kingdom and the Power”), becoming a father (“Protecting the Gift” by Gavin de Becker), and on long flights overseas while working for the BBC (Russell Brand’s “My Booky Wook”).\n\nMany moves, plus access to great libraries in various cities, have meant I’ve only retained a small fraction of the books I’ve read, no matter how much I’ve loved them. And speaking of retained, my shelf is also a reference – an “aide-mémoire,” as Proust might put it – when I want to recommend something I can’t quickly recall.\n\nThere are apps/sites that can help you track your reading consumption. The literary social network Goodreads.com, bought by Amazon in 2013, is probably the largest. But by drawing the book spines myself, I see the exact edition and copy of the one I read. And the act of drawing them is a slow, meditative art experience I look forward to with every new one. The only downside I’ve found with this project is that it has made me a bit OCD about reading entire books. If I read a parenting book for insight on my young children, I’d read the chapter on babies, too, because I don’t think it counts for the bookshelf otherwise.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don’t miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nThere is a desire in our collective human experience to mark ephemeral time with the corporeal. For some, tattoos connect them to dates and places of their lives. Others collect vials of sands from beaches, or coffee mugs from the cities they visit. Many keep journals, many more create photo albums, and many more chronicle on Facebook. The virtual bookshelf is just another form of that. A great one, I’d argue.\n\nSo, whatever else you’re bingeing on these days – podcasts, magazines, Netflix, Candy Crush, cat videos or CNN news – make sure you’re still getting a steady, healthy diet of pulp. And keep your books on a bookshelf, real or virtual, to enjoy the memories.", "authors": ["David G. Allan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}]}

Beyond debt service, that sales tax revenue would be used to fund stadium maintenance and infrastructure costs.\n\nAs part of the deal, the Titans would absorb approximately $62 million owed by the city for outstanding maintenance obligations and remaining bond debt under the current stadium lease. The team would also assume responsibility for construction cost overruns and maintenance obligations in the event that the area's sales tax revenue underperforms for the duration of a new 30-year lease.\n\nThe costs of demolishing Nissan Stadium and completing any new stadium-related infrastructure are included in the deal, according to a Monday news release.\n\nThe plan will require approval from Nashville's 40-member Metro Council. Cooper's administration intends to file initial legislation in time for the council to review it in early November.\n\nA new stadium could break ground as early as fall 2023 and be complete as early as the 2026 NFL season. Plans include a 1.7 million-square-foot stadium with a turf playing surface and capacity for up to 60,000 people. The stadium enclosure will likely feature a translucent, stationary roof, which could allow Nashville to host major events regardless of weather.\n\nExisting personal seat license holders will likely get first access to seat licenses at the new stadium, along with credit toward the new cost based on what they paid for their current seat, but details are still being refined.\n\nTitans President and CEO Burke Nihill said Monday that the stadium design will take cues from Nashville's character.\n\n\"We are trying to build the smartest building, one that can be built on budget and one that will make Nashville and Tennessee proud for decades and decades to come,\" Nihill said.\n\nHigh renovation cost estimates\n\nNegotiations to raze Nissan Stadium and build anew have been ongoing since February, when the city and team paused plans to upgrade the existing 23-year-old stadium after cost estimates exceeded expectations by more than $600 million.\n\nCooper heralded the new proposal as a \"dramatic improvement\" from the current lease because the new deal would keep the team in Nashville while shifting stadium maintenance responsibility from the city's general fund to sales tax revenue and the Titans without ceding Metro land.\n\nMetro owns the existing stadium and dozens of acres of surrounding parking lots. The city's current agreement with the Titans requires Metro to provide a \"first-class\" stadium and shoulder maintenance costs through 2039. The Titans previously estimated Nissan Stadium renovations could cost $1.8 billion.\n\n\"The current stadium lease was a significant financial liability for Nashville. That was a reality that neither the city nor the team was willing to accept,\" Nihill said, calling the new agreement a \"win-win-win scenario.\"\n\nAn ongoing study commissioned by Metro Council to estimate the cost of Metro's current obligations is expected to be complete by Nov. 1.\n\nVenue Solutions Group, the company assessing the stadium's condition, stated last week that its preliminary findings show Nissan Stadium obligations would cost the city between $1.75 and $1.9 billion over the remaining 17 years of the lease.\n\n\"This new stadium proposal protects Metro taxpayers by not spending a single dollar that could be spent elsewhere on our core priorities like education and public safety,\" Cooper stated in a news release Monday. \"Doing nothing was not a legal option for us, and renovating the current stadium proved to be financially irresponsible, so we are proposing a new stadium paid for by the team, the state, tourists and spending around the stadium — not by your family.\"\n\nBut the sales tax revenue that would fund a new stadium's revenue bonds comes with strings attached.\n\nNew stadium funding sources\n\nState statutes dictate the proceeds from the 1% hotel occupancy tax can only be used for construction costs and debt payments for an enclosed stadium or future stadium updates. Under the deal's current form, Metro would reserve the right to \"turn off\" the hotel occupancy tax once the debt is paid, according to Cooper's administration.\n\nAll sales tax proceeds from the stadium premises and the partial sales tax diversion for the yet-to-be-defined 130-acre area surrounding the stadium can be used only to fund stadium costs, debt payments or the cost of infrastructure necessary for the stadium to operate for the duration of the lease.\n\nIf revenues from the hotel occupancy tax and state-designated sales tax diversions far exceed what's needed to cover the debt and maintenance, those excess funds would be unavailable for use toward other public needs.\n\nIt's also not immediately clear if Metro will need to backstop the revenue bonds with other funding sources to offer additional security to bondholders (the city did this for a portion of the bonds for the Convention Center). Cooper's administration aims to avoid or minimize this possibility, and the Titans have not asked Metro to backstop the bonds during negotiations.\n\nThe proposed site for the new stadium is perched at the center of Cooper's sweeping plan to transform a 338-acre stretch of the Cumberland River's east bank, which is currently home to parking lots, industrial land and 113 acres of Metro-owned property including the existing Nissan Stadium.\n\nThe 130-acre sales tax revenue boundary will be drawn by Metro Council with approval from the state and will likely encompass roughly a third of the area contemplated by the Imagine East Bank Vision Plan.\n\nThe stadium deal would require Metro to provide a minimum of 2,000 parking spaces for stadium use compared to the current 7,500 spaces, releasing approximately 66 acres of Metro-owned land for other uses. The East Bank vision proposes this land could be dedicated toward a new multimodal boulevard, park space and affordable housing.\n\nThe Titans will announce expansions to community programs and other commitments to prioritize small businesses and the local workforce later this week. This will include hosting up to four Tennessee State University home games each year without cost to TSU.\n\nVoters will not be able to directly weigh in on the deal as they did with the 1996 stadium deal, which was funded using property tax-backed bonds, because state law does not provide a referendum option on revenue bonds.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2024/11/18/northwestern-plans-renderings-850-million-new-ryan-field-evanston-illinois/76401789007/", "title": "Northwestern reveals renderings, plans for new $850M Ryan Field", "text": "Northwestern football hosted No. 2 Ohio State at Wrigley Field on Saturday, showcasing one of Chicago's most iconic venues.\n\nOn Monday, the Wildcats unveiled renderings of their brand-new stadium, Ryan Field, which will open in 2026.

Beaches. Hollywood. Where anything is possible,” he says.\n\nHigh-end amenities would include an on-field patio “blurring the line between spectator and teammate,” according to the video that depicted fans sipping drinks just steps from a team bench. Eight acres would be reserved, rent-free, for an “NFL campus,” which could include a home for the NFL Network and a western annex for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nOne prominent feature from earlier versions vanished. Previous plans called for a tower that could simulate lightning bolts for the Chargers or a huge flame honoring late owner Al Davis for the Raiders.

Coach Thompson? You would not believe how smart, thorough and polished a young man Casey Thompson is. He just exudes confidence. So I asked the 22-year-old if he would ever consider becoming a football coach after his playing days are over. “I’ve thought about it,” he said. “I really enjoy the game of football. I’d think about it after my playing days are over. I want to play football as long as I can, and seeing Tom Brady play at age 43, that gives me a little bit of hope.” … Speaking of Brady, will he take any extra precautions when he returns to New England like checking inflated footballs and looking for bugs in the locker room? Just saying. … The bronze busts of the four quarterbacks of Texas’ national championship teams are done, but they won’t be unveiled in the southwest corner of Royal-Memorial Stadium outside Gate 1 until the spring game next April 23 when maybe only 20,000 or fewer show up. It’s one of the coolest projects ever, and Texas should seriously rethink and more properly honor Duke Carlisle, James Street, Eddie Phillips and Vince Young with a ceremony this fall during the actual season. Come on, Texas. … Xavier Worthy continues to blow up. Asked whom he admired as a youngster, the freshman said Cal wideout DeSean Jackson. “I model my game after him. I felt I had the same body type as his.” He’s also equally swift. Teammate Josh Thompson said when he first saw Worthy, he said, “Who is this kid? He took off. … I never saw someone that explosive. He’s fast.” I don’t think the magnitude of Texas’ 70-point monster game on Texas Tech has really sunk in. The Longhorns put up 70 with 13 1/2 minutes left in the game.

Arguably the greatest ever to play the sport, Lionel Messi announced Wednesday his plans to join Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with Spanish publications Mundo Deportivo and SPORT, Messi revealed he would not return to his beloved FC Barcelona nor sign with Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal SC, in lieu of taking his talents to South Beach once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires June 30 — a decision more captivating than David Beckham's joining MLS' LA Galaxy in 2007 and more monumental for American soccer than the arrival of Pele in 1975.\n\n\"I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,\" Messi told Mundo Deportivo. \"I still haven't closed it 100%. I'm missing some things, but we decided to continue the path.\"\n\nThe Athletic reported Tuesday that MLS is considering offering Messi a revenue share generated from MLS Season Pass subscriptions, plus a profit-sharing agreement with the league's official supplier Adidas that would derive from his time in MLS and an option to purchase a percentage of an MLS franchise following his playing time in the league. MLS released a statement Wednesday prefacing it's \"pleased\" that Messi intends to join Miami this summer, but \"work remains to finalize an agreement.\"\n\nMessi's decision to don the Miami rose pink and black jersey adds an awe-inspiring talent that media partners MLS and Apple hope to market to a global audience with MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+. Messi — whose shelves display 42 trophies for club and country, notably a 2022 FIFA World Cup, four UEFA Champions League titles and a record seven Ballon d'Or trophies for the world's best player — is equipped to do it because of who he is, even if the current on-field product lags behind Europe.\n\nStill, it's a start. A start that, in a perfect scenario, would drive MLS toward becoming a destination league for the world's best players. That would require a sensational buy-in via Apple TV and, thus, lead to more revenue and higher roster spending in a league that becomes competitively at eye level with France's Ligue 1, Italy's Serie A, Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga and the English Premier League.\n\nLionel Messi to MLS: At a glance\n\nBefore Messi could finalize his MLS contract, the cheapest ticket for Miami's League Cup clash with Cruz Azul already ballooned from $39 to $329, according to TickPick.\n\nFor MLS, a demand such as this implies that the league's best opportunity at forging the fan relationship it desires, which includes selling MLS Season Pass subscriptions, is a long-term season ticketholder program that would in theory offer such fans special access to clubs and its players, MLS Commissioner Don Garber told The Tennessean in February.\n\n\"It's understanding what motivates our fans to be connected to our players and to our clubs and to our league,\" Garber said. \"What motivates them, what inspires them, and how can we create a lifelong relationship with that fan. And if we're able to do that, through great product on the field and through a considered active marketing relationship, then that will pay long-term dividends.\"\n\nMessi, soon to 36, fits that bill.\n\nAccording to Barcelona-based journalist Helena Condis, Messi snubbed Al Hilal's three-year, $1.5 billion offer to come to the U.S. He departs a PSG squad featuring Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, star power that isn't currently represented on Inter Miami (5-11-0), the third-worst team in MLS.\n\nMessi's role in MLS and Leagues Cup action could begin to change that, coupled with the Copa America in 2024 and FIFA World Cup in 2026 on home soil around Miami. It all screams revenue streams. Messi, it should be noted, could debut for Miami as early as July 21 in the newly revamped Leagues Cup against Liga MX side Cruz Azul at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nMLS has a $5.21 million salary cap in 2023, not including allocation money, with $651,250 as a maximum salary charge per player to that cap. As the Messi in Miami era ages, teams, players and fans alike should expect significant bumps in the MLS soft cap, which would increase roster spending. Any failure by MLS owners to do so would divert the league from its target of becoming a top league in the world.\n\nMLS can't let Messi blockbuster divert from grand plan\n\nBeckham's contribution to merchandise, domestic and international TV revenue, as well as national relevance for a 13-team league at the time, was colossal in the late 2000s. And Pele before him nearly carried the sport before there was an MLS in the late 1970s. Messi's role varies drastically — from a 29-team league with four teams spending over $20 million, to a global streaming partner in Apple and the natural league host for the World Cup in three years time.\n\nWhich means MLS can't stop here and rest simply on the laurels of Messi's star power.\n\nIt must continue to act.\n\nMessi will become the the greatest ambassador MLS has ever had. The next step is to not only attract stars at the end of their careers but stars at the beginning, such as the Neymars, Marco Verrattis, James Rodriguezes, Harry Kanes and the like.\n\nThat is, if Saudi Arabia doesn't sign them first.\n\nFor stories about Nashville SC or Soccer in Tennessee, contact Drake Hills at DHills@gannett.com.

The new tariffs on imports from all three nations ‒ which are on top of existing tariffs ‒ will go into effect Saturday, the White House said.\n\n\"China makes the fentanyl, gives it to Mexico, puts it through Canada, puts it through different places, mostly Mexico, but also a lot through Canada,\" Trump said. \"And so all three haven't treated us very well.\"\n\nTariffs, inflation, and retailers: How Trump's potential tariffs could hit your wallet\n\nAddressing reporters in the Oval Office, Trump also vowed to impose blanket tariffs on all oil and gas imports by Feb. 18. He reiterated plans to place sweeping tariffs on metals such as steel and cooper as well as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and other goods. He also said he will impose tariffs on goods from the European Union at a later time.\n\n\"Absolutely, the European Union has treated us so terribly,\" Trump said.\n\nEconomists warn tariffs, which are taxes on foreign imports, can lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump campaigned on promising to bring down inflation. But 11 days into his second term, Trump has shown he plans to use tariffs ‒ a hallmark of his first term ‒ as a tool to achieve both his foreign policy aims and domestic agenda.\n\nTrump said the tariff on oil imports from Canada would likely be set at a lower rate of 10%. He said there's nothing Canada and Mexico can do to stop his actions on tariffs. \"No, not right now,\" he said.\n\n\"You see the power of the tariff,\" Trump said. \"Nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank.\"\n\nHe downplayed the impact on American consumers. \"Tariffs don't cause inflation. They cause success,\" Trump said. \"There could be some temporary short-term disruption, and people will understand that.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada would respond forcefully to Trump's tariffs, signaling a potential for a trade war between the two North American allies.\n\n\"We're ready with a response - a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response. It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act,\" Trudeau said in televised address, adding that all options were on the table.\n\nBecause more than 75% of Canada's goods and service exports go to the United States, Trudeau said the tariffs could have significant repercussions on the Canadian economy.\n\n\"I won't sugarcoat it ‒ our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,\" Trudeau said.\n\nBesides crude oil, other major U.S. imports from Canada include wood and lumber, plastics, charcoal, aluminum, paper books, and iron and steel appliances.\n\nTrump threatened the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China shortly after he won the November election but did not impose the tariffs on the first day in office as he originally pledged.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all steel, aluminum and copper imported to the U.S. as well as goods such as computer chips, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in a push to increase U.S. production of the products.\n\n\"It's time for the United States to return to the system that made us richer and more powerful than ever before,\" Trump said Monday at a retreat for Republican lawmakers at the Trump National Doral hotel and golf club in Miami.

The move is intended to level the playing field for domestic manufacturers, but it has sparked tensions and risks a global trade war. The European Union, which is hit with these latest tariffs, retaliated within hours with counter duties put on U.S. goods exports.\n\nTrump's move came after he reversed his threat made Tuesday to impose 50% tariffs on the steel and aluminum that crosses America from Canada after the province of Ontario said it would charge U.S. customers a tariff for electricity. The president justified his tariff plan — the tax paid by importers on goods when they cross international borders — citing his authority to declare a national emergency over electricity in the affected areas.\n\nThe tariffs that remain in place create an unprecedented disruption to the auto industry that will almost certainly result in a price hike, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions.\n\nThat's because the companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tariff to the government, contrary to Trump’s claims that exporting nations pay it. That means the automakers would foot the bill for any steel or aluminum imported to the States.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“The North American auto industry has been working for 30 years in harmonized production and shipment of parts and vehicles across all three countries’ borders,\" Fiorani said. \"Disrupting the price of those vehicles or parts from Canada and/or Mexico will only increase the price of vehicles and scare consumers away from buying them.\"\n\nFiorani said the rising cost to import steel and aluminum for vehicles will result in automakers offsetting the cost hike by raising prices. Likewise, if the carmakers shift to using more steel and aluminum from domestic producers, those prices will go up because it will cost those producers more to increase their production.\n\n\"Everything is set up right now to be the most efficient it can be, and interrupting the price and flow of parts and vehicles can only increase the price,\" Fiorani said.\n\nAutomakers' reactions\n\nSpeaking for the Detroit Three, Rich Chrismer of the American Automotive Policy Council said in a statement emailed to the Detroit Free Press that Ford, GM and Stellantis purchase the vast majority of their steel and aluminum in the United States or North America.\n\n“We are still reviewing and awaiting all of the details of the tariffs, but revoking the exemption for Canada and Mexico and extending tariffs to auto parts with steel and aluminum will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers,\" the statement read.\n\nFord has been the most vocal of the Detroit automakers about its appeal to Washington to reconsider tariffs. As the Free Press has reported, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has talked about his phone conversations with Trump about tariffs and how they would hurt the auto industry. Just last month, Bill Ford said the automaker's leadership was \"spending a lot of time making sure that the administration understands the implications for our business.\"\n\nLikewise, Ford CEO Jim Farley said he has made a few trips to the nation's capital to educate legislators on the impact tariffs would have on the industry. He told investors, \"Let's be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen.\"\n\nThe industry's pushback against broad tariffs\n\nTrump has listened to Detroit auto leaders as they have petitioned against broad tariffs on auto imports, but remains insistent on tariffs.\n\nOn March 5, Trump put a 30-day pause on tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports used by domestic automakers under the existing USMCA trade agreement. The pause came after General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Farley and Bill Ford, as well as Stellantis Chair John Elkann asked for the reprieve during a phone call with the president a day earlier. The leaders told the president the tariffs would put them at a competitive disadvantage against rival import automakers.\n\nThe existing supply chains of motor vehicle components and vehicles often crisscross the Northern and Southern borders multiple times as some models are produced. Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing had estimated that broad 25% tariffs on all parts and vehicles crossing from Canada and Mexico to the United States, could drive the cost of a new car up by $9,000 or more.\n\nJamie L.

Trump defended the tariffs in remarks late Tuesday and hinted at the possibility of higher levies in the future.\n\nThe action comes amid broad economic upheaval: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed it is laying off 1,029 workers as part of the Trump administration's mass layoffs across federal departments. Federal agencies face a deadline Thursday to submit plans for large-scale layoffs as part of the administration's effort to shrink the federal government.\n\nU.S. stocks were mostly higher in afternoon trading Wednesday but have fallen sharply in recent days amid constant news of tariffs and job cuts. J.P. Morgan's chief economist said Wednesday that there is a 40% chance of a U.S. recession in 2025.\n\nUS will counter European Union’s retaliatory tariffs\n\nThe U.S. will respond to Europe's levies with additional tariffs on imports from the European Union, Trump said Wednesday.\n\n“Of course I will respond,” Trump told reporters after the EU announced new tariffs on $28 billion of U.S. industrial and farm products. The tariffs counter Trump’s 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports.\n\n“The European Union treats us very badly, and they have for years,” Trump said as he met in the Oval Office with Ireland Prime Minister Micheal Martin, whose country is part of the EU. Trump accused Ireland and other European nations of taking advantage of the U.S., and he accused Ireland of drawing pharmaceutical companies away from the United States.\n\n“Look, the Irish are smart,” Trump said to Martin. “You have smart people. And you took our pharmaceutical companies, and other companies, through taxation. They made it very good for companies to move over there.”\n\nTrump also reiterated the EU, like all nations, will be subject to his new reciprocal tariffs, set to go in effect April 2, whereby the U.S. will respond to any country’s tariffs applied to U.S. exports by matching with identical levies of the same rates.\n\n“It doesn't even matter what it is,” Trump said. “If they charge us 25% or 20% to 10% or 2% or 200%, then that's what we're charging them.”\n\nCanada announces tariff retaliation\n\nCanadian authorities announced tariffs on more than $20 billion worth of American goods in retaliation for the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Earlier, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday for talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump administration officials to discuss revising the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.\n\nThat came after a flurry of activity Tuesday, when Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50% on its steel and aluminum exports.\n\nTrump reversed course after Ford, essentially the governor of the Ontario province, said he would suspend a proposed 25% electricity surcharge on about 1.5 million U.S. energy users in New York, Michigan and Minnesota. Ford made his decision after a phone call with Lutnick: “We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail,” Ford said.\n\n\"We will wait until April 2 and from then we will see whether our definition of reciprocal tariffs will be applied too,\" he said.\n\nTariffs 101: Who pays for them?\n\nTariffs can apply to exports but are are primarily levied on imports, typically to protect industries in the country levying them. Tariffs make imports more expensive, thus making local goods cheaper by comparison. Tariffs also can provide income that can be used to support local industries, fund public programs or cover government expenditures.\n\nAnd they can serve as bargaining tools to win concessions from trading partners.\n\n\"While tariffs may seem to penalize foreign producers by making their goods or services less competitive, the reality is that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately bear the cost,\" the Wilson Center scholars Diego Marroquín Bitar and Valeria Moy write in a \"Tariffs 101\" analysis.\n\nAmericans disapprove of tariffs, Trump economy, poll says\n\nMuch as Trump defends imposing tariffs on some of the U.S.’ closest allies, the tactic is not popular with a majority of Americans, who said they find the way he has been handling the economy too erratic, a new poll says.\n\nThe two-day survey by Reuters/Ipsos revealed that 57% of respondents, among them one-third of his fellow Republicans, say Trump’s economic approach has been inconsistent as he has set off a trade war with several nations that has shaken the stock market.\n\nTrump campaigned on bringing down the price of goods, and 32% of Americans approve of his impact on the cost of living, the poll indicated. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents – 70% overall, including 60% of Republicans – expect the tariffs to result in more expensive groceries and other common items.\n\nTrump’s overall approval rate is 44%, a figure that has remained steady for most of the first seven-plus weeks of his second term in the White House.\n\nAdministration officials say it will take time for Trump’s tariff-centric strategy to pay off in the desired increase in American manufacturing. About 41% of poll respondents believe that.\n\nEconomist warns of lasting damage to US investment reputation\n\nThere is about a 40% chance of a U.S. recession this year and a risk of lasting damage to the country's standing as an investment destination if the administration undermines trust in U.S. governance, according to J.P. Morgan's chief economist.\n\n\"Where we stand now is with a heightened concern about the U.S. economy,\" Bruce Kasman, the U.S. investment bank's chief global economist, told reporters in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley last week downgraded their U.S. GDP growth forecasts and now see growth at 1.7% and 1.5% this year, respectively.\n\nWhite House: No details on staff cuts until after Thursday deadline\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined Wednesday to provide an update on reductions in force plans submitted by federal departments but said details will be available after Thursday’s deadline.\n\n“This is a goal that every Cabinet secretary across the board agrees with,” Leavitt told reporters. “We have to reduce our workforce. We have to make our bureaucracy more efficient. And then when the March 13 deadline hits, we can talk about that then.”\n\nThe White House has told federal departments to submit by Thursday budget and personnel management plans for large-scale workforce reductions ordered by Trump that go far deeper than the cuts of probationary workers executed by his administration so far.\n\nAmong the planned reductions reported by USA TODAY are terminations of 76,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1,300 workers from the Department of Education and more than 1,000 workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trump has also openly discussed cuts of 65% to the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce.\n\nDepartment of Education layoffs: Trump says decisions on education belong to states\n\nTrump on Wednesday defended his administration's decision to lay off about half of the Education Department's staff, citing concerns that students in China, Norway, Denmark and Sweden are performing better than those who go to schools in the U.S.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House he supports Education Secretary Linda McMahon and the workforce reduction at the department. He said it's a move toward the administration's goal to move education oversight from federal to state leaders.\n\n\"We have a dream. And you know what the dream is? We're going to move the Department of Education,\" Trump said. \"We're going to move education into the states, so that the states − instead of bureaucrats working in Washington − can run education.\"\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nLower gas prices fuel better inflation news for February\n\nInflation eased more than expected in February, but the reprieve will likely be short-lived, economists say, and the barrage of import tariffs is likely to propel prices higher. Used car prices rose in February while gasoline costs fell. Grocery prices were flat after a flurry of increases and rent hikes slowed to a new three-year low.\n\nSome economists say the president’s import fees, especially on Chinese shipments, may already be reigniting inflation for products such as household furnishings, apparel and electronics.\n\nIn February, consumer prices climbed 2.8% from a year earlier, down from a 3% rise the previous month, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, a measure of average changes in goods and services costs. That breaks a string of four straight increases in the annual price measure but still leaves it well above the September low of 2.4% and the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal.

The agency, which includes the National Weather Service, forecasts weather, monitors oceanic and atmospheric conditions and conducts deep-sea exploration, among other responsibilities. NOAA has a workforce of about 12,000 worldwide but already cut more than 880 employees two weeks ago.\n\n“It does not include reductions in NWS forecast operations and maintenance support at this time,” the email sent to NOAA staff reads. “However, the final determination will be made by the Department of Commerce.”\n\nLast month's terminations focused on recently hired or promoted probationary workers. However, the latest email to employees notes that \"a few probationary employees in NOAA ... have received rescission letters reversing their terminations.\" The email said it was determined those layoffs \"were made in error.\"\n\nFederal departments across the government are finalizing “Reduction in Force” plans in their agencies ahead of a Thursday deadline set by the Trump administration.\n\nNOAA lays off 1,000 employees: President Trump escalates federal cuts\n\nWill NOAA cuts impact weather forecasting?\n\nNOAA has sweeping responsibilities for safeguarding American lives and protecting property by monitoring and forecasting the nation’s most violent storms, daily weather and long-term climate.\n\nNOAA's cuts at the National Weather Service, which it oversees, could have direct impacts on the weather forecasts Americans rely on. Every time someone checks their phone for the latest weather forecast, they put your trust in data from the National Weather Service.\n\nInformation from the weather service \"underpins the forecasts within weather apps, news reports, hurricane path models and extreme weather alerts,\" the National Resources Defense Council said in a recent report.\n\n40% chance of a US recession in 2025: JP Morgan economist issues warning\n\nMore federal job cuts expected\n\nJust a month after Trump's administration fired over 100,000 early tenure government employees, his administration is planning a larger slashing of the federal workforce across the country. The job cuts come as economists are increasingly worried about the risk of a recession because of Trump's trade war with Canada and Mexico, which has battered stock prices.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Trump administration official told USA TODAY the Department of Education will be laying off one-half of its staff. Department employees were ordered not to come into the office Wednesday.\n\nThe next big deadline is Thursday, when agencies need to submit plans for large-scale layoffs. Agencies may notify employees any day that their jobs are expiring within 30 or 60 days.\n\n− Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump deadline for layoffs near: Thursday is deadline: What we know about the plans\n\nHead of US aluminum producer calls tariffs a 'game-changer'\n\nAt least one executive believes Trump’s increased tariffs will be \"a game-changer'' in putting U.S. aluminum companies on equal footing with their foreign counterparts.\n\n“The president is standing up for the industry and putting America on a level playing field with foreign producers,” said Jesse Gary, president and CEO of Century Aluminum, one of the largest aluminum producers in the U.S. “We’re excited.”\n\nGary said Trump’s move comes as his company, thanks to a $500 million grant by the Department of Energy last year, is poised to build the nation’s first new aluminum smelter in nearly 50 years. The processing facility, to be located along the Mississippi River basin, is expected to add 5,000 jobs during its construction and eventually 1,000 permanent jobs when completed, Gary said.\n\nHe added that the new smelter could double the size of the current aluminum production in the country, which shrank dramatically as the U.S. went from about 23 smelters two decades ago to only four today due to increasing overseas competition.\n\n“Our new jobs will have an average $140,000 wage benefit,'' Gary said. \"These are not only highly skilled jobs but blue-collar jobs that workers can build a family around.''\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nDemocratic governors rip Education Department cuts\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, was frank the day after the Trump administration announced roughly half of the Department of Education’s workforce would be terminated.\n\n“I know Wisconsin kids and our schools – getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education and making devastating cuts to public education would be a catastrophe, as simple as that,” he said in a press call.\n\nEvers is a former teacher, principal and superintendent. He joined fellow Democratic governors and former educators Matt Meyer of Delaware and Tim Walz of Minnesota on a call to condemn the recent layoffs.\n\nWalz also took aim at recently installed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, who defended the cuts and said the administration “kept all of the right people and the good people.”\n\n“Saying she fired half the people but only the bad ones,” Walz said the next morning. “She missed one. She missed one for sure, and that’s herself.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nCanadian trade leader hopes for resolution of tariff tension\n\nTrump's 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports is “discouraging,” Catherine Cobden, president and CEO of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, told USA TODAY. However, Cobden hopes the issue, which she said has already caused job losses, production curtailment, and investment deferrals, can be resolved.\n\n“We hope we can continue our strong partnership,'' Cobden said Wednesday. \"We really didn’t want to be in this situation with this trade war with our largest trading partner.’'\n\nThe U.S. imports more steel and aluminum from Canada than any other country. Cobden called Canada's announcement of $20.7 billion in tariffs on U.S. imported goods, expected to take effect Thursday, a \"reciprocal move.” Both countries are battling unfair trading, she said.\n\nCobden said she’s optimistic the sparring will end and upcoming talks between Ontario Premier Doug Ford and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will lead to a renegotiated USMCA free trade treaty.\n\n“I’m not saying it’s 100% perfect, but we’ve done a lot together, and it’s been to our mutual benefit,” Cobden said. “We do not want to go backwards.”\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nImpact of tariffs will extend to travel\n\nU.S. consumers could see higher prices on a wide range of products, from fertilizers to printed books and sugar. Those planning vacations could feel the effects, too. Trump’s latest tariffs are likely to have some impact on travelers, though it won’t be as immediate or noticeable as the rise in prices in other areas.\n\nAccording to Steven A. Carvell, a professor of finance at the S.C. Johnson College of Business at Cornell University, business travel will likely take the biggest hit first. He added that large trade shows like the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas could be affected if businesses decide to prioritize exhibiting in other countries.\n\n“There will be less cross-border travel and less demand for hotel room nights because of that,\" Carvell told USA TODAY. \"Group travel will be down because of that, meetings maybe.”\n\nHow will tariffs impact travel? Here's what you should know.\n\nTrump again floats higher tariff rate\n\nTrump defended his aggressive use of tariffs in remarks Tuesday to business leaders in Washington – and suggested higher tariffs could be on the way. Speaking before The Business Roundtable, Trump touted a “renewed spirit” in the U.S. manufacturing sector because of his tariffs on imports, even as the new duties have caused the stock market to plunge.\n\n“They don't want to pay 25% or whatever it may be,” Trump said of companies, referring to the tariff rate he’s set on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as all steel and aluminum imports. “It may go up higher. Look, the higher it goes, the more likely it is they’re going to build (in the United States).”\n\nTrump’s remarks came shortly after his administration abruptly reversed doubling steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50% after Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, agreed to suspend a 25% electricity surcharge on U.S. energy users.\n\nSome companies eye increased production in US\n\nSome companies have said they are looking at expanding their presence or setting up shop in the United States as they prepare for Trump's tariffs. The Italian spirits group Campari is assessing the opportunities to expand its production in the U.S. without losing the essence of its brand portfolio, its new CEO Simon Hunt said last week.\n\nThe Taiwanese contract laptop maker Compal Electronics may expand into the U.S. and has spoken to several southern states about a possible investment, CEO Anthony Peter Bonadero said in January, adding that Texas was a leading candidate, but no decisions had been made yet.

He said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice.\n\nChina immediately countered the U.S. duties with 10% to 15% tariffs on some U.S. agricultural products it imports.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, meanwhile, vowed retaliatory tariffs during a news conference in Mexico City on Tuesday.\n\nWho pays the tariffs?\n\nThe importing business, not the source country, pays the tariffs. They are applied as “taxes or duties levied on importers,” according to Investopedia, a consumer finance website.\n\nTariffs would be paid by whoever is importing the foreign goods. They typically pass those costs on to the American consumer, said Parul Jain, who teaches finance at the Rutgers Business School in Newark. Other companies might also use the tariff-induced increases as a reason to raise their prices, Jain said.\n\nCompanies might absorb the costs rather than pass them onto consumers, but that could prompt them to put off investments, such as additional hiring, expanding to a new location or the development on additional products, Jain said.\n\nIn 2022, exports from New Jersey supported 129,000 jobs, according to the federal Office of the U.S Trade Representative.\n\nWhere are tariffs paid?\n\nTariffs are paid “at the time of customs clearance” in whatever port the goods are moving through, according to the International Trade Administration, which is part of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nThat would mean duties on products coming into the U.S. through New Jersey would be paid at the Ports of Elizabeth and Newark.\n\nWhy is Trump putting tariffs on Canada and Mexico?\n\nTariffs can be used to try to compel a trading partner to behave a certain way. Trump previously used tariffs to that end to some success with Colombia, to ensure the South American nation’s acceptance of U.S. military flights carrying deported Colombian migrants.\n\nOn Monday, the president declared that Mexico, Canada and China had failed to do enough to stem the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. The other three countries disputed that judgment.\n\n\"While President Trump has announced that tariffs are officially in place, past negotiations with Mexico and Canada have shown how quickly these policies can shift,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive research site Edmunds.\n\nWill tariffs bring manufacturing back to the U.S.?\n\nTrump is also hoping that companies would find it cheaper to manufacture products in the United States, said Jain, the Rutgers professor.\n\nThat's possible. In an editorial board meeting with The Record and NorthJersey.com in January, Gov. Phil Murphy said he's heard from some businesses that are considering building up some operations in the U.S. to avoid the levies.\n\nBut such a process can take years, and some goods such as coffee, cocoa beans and avocados simply can’t be produced domestically at high volume.\n\nWhat exports from New Jersey to Canada will be affected the most?\n\nNew Jersey exports $8.8 billion of goods to Canada annually, according to the Canadian Consulate General in New York. That's about equal to the amount America imports from the country.\n\nTop Garden State exports to our neighbor to the north include:\n\nPearls, gems, precious metals and jewelry\n\nPlastics\n\nPerfumes, essential oils and toiletries\n\nFuel oil\n\nPharmaceutical products\n\nOrganic chemicals\n\nComputers\n\nOptical, medical and precision instruments\n\nFruits and nuts\n\nPrepared vegetables\n\nWhat NJ exports to China will be most affected?\n\nNew Jersey exports $2.2 billion of goods annually to China, according to the U.S-China Business Council, while China sends $13.6 billion in imports back, according to the Chinese Consulate General in New York.\n\nThese are the top exports from New Jersey to China.\n\nNonferrous metal products, such as pipes, roofing, gutters, signs and electrical components\n\nSoaps, cleaning agents and toiletries\n\nBasic chemicals\n\nNavigational and measuring instruments\n\nMedical equipment and supplies\n\nWhat NJ exports to Mexico would be affected?\n\nNew Jersey exported roughly $3.3 billion of goods to Mexico in 2023, according to the nation’s foreign ministry, compared to $7.6 billion in imports.\n\nThese are the top exports on that list:\n\nBasic chemicals\n\nNavigational, medical and control instruments\n\nSoaps and cleaning supplies\n\nResin and plastics, synthetic rubber, artificial and synthetic fibers and filaments\n\nElectrical equipment and components\n\nNJ warehousing, logistics industries could be impacted\n\nNew Jersey is home to a sprawling warehouse, trucking and supply chain logistics industry given its proximity to major ports, and its \"economy does rely on the movement of goods to and through our state,\" said Christopher Emigholz, who heads government affairs for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a trade group.\n\nTariffs could drag down the quantities of imports and exports passing through the ports, which in turn could push down port activity and hit related logistics and warehouse businesses, added Tim Evans, research director of the policy advocacy group New Jersey Future.\n\n“People stop buying as much imported stuff, you can definitely see a drop-off in the need to unpack it,\" Evans said. \"That would cause a drop in demand\" for warehouses and “if they experience a sudden drop in demand, that affects New Jersey.”\n\nThis article contains information from USA Today\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100 and Facebook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/14/in-indiana-tariffs-are-a-win-for-steel-industry-others-arent-sure/82310695007/", "title": "In Indiana, tariffs are a win for steel industry.

Trump again on social media said he wanted Canada \"to become our cherished Fifty First State.\"\n\nCanadian energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures, such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals if U.S. tariffs persist.\n\nCanada ships about 4 million barrels of crude to the U.S. per day via pipeline, mainly to Midwest refineries. Canadian tariffs on American ethanol are also an option, he added.\n\nMost U.S.-Canada trade remains duty-free under the USMCA trade deal that Trump signed in 2020, but he continues to complain about Canada's high tariff rates for dairy products. Ottawa last week won a month's reprieve for USMCA-compliant exports from Trump's general 25% tariffs for Canada threatened over fentanyl trafficking.\n\nBut in early April, Canada also faced Trump's reciprocal tariffs aimed at raising U.S. tariffs to match other countries' rates and counteract non-tariff barriers.\n\nCanada, with ample hydropower resources that made primary aluminum production more cost-effective than in the U.S., has built a commanding position in the U.S. aluminum market, even as U.S. smelters once revived by Trump's tariffs have been idled.\n\nRise in fears of recession\n\nChina remains the number two supplier of aluminum and goods made from aluminum but already faces high tariffs to counteract alleged dumping and subsidies, as well as a new 20% tariff that Trump has imposed over the past month over fentanyl trafficking.\n\nTrump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists increasingly worry could cause a recession.\n\nA small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/31/trump-choice-tariffs-revenue-revenge/77930882007/", "title": "Donald Trump's choice on tariffs: Is it about revenue or revenge?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump faces a choice ahead of a Feb. 1 target date for his tariffs to begin kicking in: revenue or revenge?\n\nHe campaigned on a blanket tariff that would generate revenue and help protect American workers. But since he was elected, Trump has toyed with country-specific tariffs as a negotiating tactic or punitive measure.\n\nTrump has talked about using tariffs as a way to offset some of the revenue that would be lost by extending and expanding his 2017 tax cuts. He added tariffs on pharmaceuticals, computer chips and metals such as copper, steel and aluminum to his list on Monday, which he said could help pay for another tax cut for domestic manufacturers and bring industrial jobs back to the United States.\n\nBut he also has threatened to impose tariffs as a form of punishment for countries he views as uncooperative − which means forgoing the duties if they do concede to his demands. That includes tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada, unless they clamp down on fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration.\n\n\"We're going to protect our country with tariffs,” Trump told Republican lawmakers in a speech. “If they don’t make their product in America, then very simply, they should have to pay a tariff, which will bring in trillions of dollars into our treasury,” he added, referring to foreign manufacturers.\n\nTrump allies say he may ultimately go with some combination of the ideas he’s floating or a tariff strategy that wraps in all of the above.\n\n“Punish our enemies, use tariffs as a bargaining chip and use tariffs as a revenue-raising measure to offset the reduction in the income taxes that we want to do,” said Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser for Trump's campaign and a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, of the thinking inside the White House.\n\nSome experts say that approach could cause problems down the line. Tariffs that countries can wriggle out of through policy concessions are not a stable revenue source, and what if other nations follow through on threats to introduce retaliatory tariffs?\n\nTariffs that are primarily used as a negotiating tool to drive national security policy, “can be immensely effective,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n“But if that's how they're used, it will undermine their positive effects on fiscal policy, because it is never clear how long they will be in place,” MacGuineas said. “If you want to offset permanent tax cuts, there'd have to be a commitment that the tariffs will be permanent, and that seems highly unlikely.”\n\nThe president could wind up with less revenue than he’s expecting and send costs soaring for Americans, experts and economists say. Even the threat of tariffs can create uncertainty in the markets, slow trade and damage America’s relationships with its allies.\n\n\"Our experiments with tariffs over the last decade have not gone great,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics at the right-leaning CATO Institute.\n\nA focus on reducing trade deficits\n\nTrump has cited trade deficits and other spending imbalances for pursuing sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. had a trade deficit of $773.4 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Annual data for 2024 has not been released yet.\n\nIts largest deficits were with China, at $279.4 billion, the European Union, at $208.2 billion and Mexico at $152.4 billion. Another target of Trump’s complaints, Canada, had a trade deficit of $67.9 billion.\n\n“China's an abuser, but the European Union is very, very bad to us,” Trump told reporters last week. “Essentially, everybody treats us badly,” he added.\n\nHe said in remarks to the World Economic Forum later in the week that the trade deficit with Europe is immense, \"And we’re going to do something about it.\"\n\nHis first evening on office, Trump ordered his administration to investigate the \"causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, as well as the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and recommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits.\"\n\nYet, it is taking Trump and his nascent economic team longer than he suggested to sort it out. He said as president-elect that he'd put tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he is considering tariffs of 25% for Canada and Mexico and a hike of 10% for China. Those actions could be announced as soon as Feb. 1.\n\nUsing tariff threats as a diplomatic weapon\n\nTrump said on the campaign trail that he’d put blanket tariffs of 10-20% on every nation, before shifting to a strategy during the transition of threatening them against individual countries who dared to cross him.\n\nTrump moved over the weekend to immediately put tariffs on Colombia after the Latin American country refused to accept migrant repatriation flights. He revoked the order after the Colombian government agreed to his terms.\n\nPeter Navarro, the senior counselor at the White House for trade and manufacturing, said in a Fox Business interview on Monday that other countries would “think twice” as a result about refusing American planes.\n\n“This particular incident sends a signal to every other country that the president is not messing around when he says we’re deporting your exports,” Navarro said.\n\nTrump seemed to open up a new front in his tariff agenda Monday evening as he spoke to House Republican lawmakers in Florida. He said during a speech he could put duties on specific products.\n\nTrump previewed tariffs on computer chips, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in the “very near” future to redirect business investment into the United States.\n\nHe said he’d also be placing tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, and other items that are needed to support the U.S. military. “We have to bring production back to our country,” Trump said.\n\nIn an extensive riff on the subject, he said companies that make their products in America should have their taxes reduced to 15% from the 21% that his first administration and a Republican Congress adopted.\n\nAs for the universal tariffs, Trump told reporters Monday evening on Air Force One that he was currently looking at a number that was much higher than a 2.5% baseline and gradual increase that his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly put forward.\n\nEven before the recent shifts in Trump's proposals, Lincicome, of the CATO Institute, said \"there's a lot of incoherence\" to what Trump was putting forward.\n\n\"You can't have a stable revenue raiser or a stable industry protector if you're applying and removing tariffs constantly because of negotiations,\" he said.\n\nTrump allies say there are multiple reasons to use tariffs, and maximizing leverage and raising revenue are not mutually exclusive.\n\nA century ago, the primary way the federal government made its money was through tariffs, former Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien argued. “So there's a lot of revenue to be had there for the federal government.”\n\n“I think the tariffs will also incentivize American companies to come home, and partner countries that have great corporations like South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland, and other big countries that have well-developed economies and big companies that make a lot of money selling into America, to move their manufacturing of those products that they sell here to the United States,\" O’Brien said.\n\nHe predicted Trump would implement a universal tariff, from which he could exempt certain countries who do what he’s asking them to before or after the deadline.\n\n“If you do a blanket, then every country’s going to be knocking on your door to try to figure out how to get out from under the blanket. So the leverage is still there,” he said. “I don’t think it diminishes your leverage.”\n\nTariff proposals draw dissent from all corners\n\nTrump put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in his first term. He also went after imported washing machines and solar panels. He targeted China for tariffs in particular. Beijing responded by putting duties on the United States. So did India.\n\nInitially, he left Canada, Mexico and the European Union off his steel and aluminum tariff list before adding them later that same year. The dispute with Canada and Mexico was eventually solved by the ratification of a three-way trade agreement and after a long back-and-forth.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs were put into place by the EU and then paused under an agreement with the Biden administration. The suspension lasts through the end of March.\n\n“Are you sure that everybody will just go on and kind of continue without reacting? And as we saw from the previous time, countries, and EU as well, stood their ground,” EU Ambassador Jovita Neliupšienė said in an interview, referring to what happened after Trump introduced tariffs in his first term. “We really have our own trade defense instruments, and we used (them) last time.”\n\nCanada, China and Mexico have also signaled they would respond to tariffs with trade actions of their own.\n\nIf the idea is to balance trade, Neliupšienė told USA TODAY, there are measures Europe can discuss with the Trump administration. “And we are ready for that.”\n\n“If, you know, the question is about revenues and closing the budget gaps, it will not necessarily be as effective as people believe,” she said. “It actually can be really quite counterproductive, as it was last time, because a lot of goods were targeted, and (the) federal government had to step in and compensate some losses for some sectors.”\n\nShe suggested that higher imports by Europe of liquefied natural gas from the United States could be an area of discussion.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in the U.S. have accused Trump of effectively pursuing a national sales tax that will increase the cost of living.\n\n“These sweeping tariffs would raise prices, threaten jobs and harm our economy,\" Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told reporters during a January call, during which she introduced legislation that, if passed, would restrict Trump’s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs.\n\n\"Our allies and adversaries alike won’t take these tariffs lying down,\" DelBene said. \"They’ll retaliate against U.S. businesses and workers like they have in the past.”\n\nAfter Trump implemented tariffs in his first term, India closed its markets to American apples, which harmed farmers in her home state of Washington, she said. She warned that Canadians were already developing a list of items that they would target.\n\n“This is the textbook definition of a trade war,” DelBene said.\n\nTrump advisers have disputed claims that the proposed tariffs would spike prices, noting that inflation remained low during Trump's first term.\n\nBut even with Trump at the helm, not all types of tariffs are universally supported by Republicans.\n\nTexas Rep. Michael McCaul, a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview just before Trump returned to office, “If the tariffs are used as a sort of tool to effectuate better policy and behavior, then I'm all for them.”\n\nHowever, when it comes to putting duties on semiconductors, he said, Congress already incentivized production in the U.S. through the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe downside of putting across the board tariffs in place, McCaul added, is consumer prices could increase. “And I don't think the American people are going like that, when all of a sudden prices go up on everything.\"\n\nTrump has said he could tariff and sanction Russia to get the country to settle its war against Ukraine. Moore, an outside economic adviser to Trump, suggested new tariffs could also be on the way for Iran.\n\nYet, even Moore said he disagreed with protectionist-style tariffs on individual products like the ones on imported steel that Trump put into place in his first term. They didn't help much Moore, an economist said, because the price of steel went up.\n\n“I'm just not a big fan of those. I hope he doesn't go in that direction ... I'd much prefer a universal low-rate tariff,” Moore said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/02/15/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-industry-kentucky-mcconnell/78604953007/", "title": "McConnell: Trump's tariffs will hurt KY industries, economy | Opinion", "text": "Sen.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff encompassed roughly a quarter of all imports, flaring tensions with U.S. trading partners and halving American imports and exports as a result. Caught in the crosshairs, Americans learned the hard way that trade wars are expensive, and today, we ought to be careful deciding with whom to pick them.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president sought to impose sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, as well as key imports, such as steel and aluminum. While the administration walked back plans to levy 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada – paused now for 30 days as both nations brokered deals to tighten border security and crack down on illegal drugs – the president’s aggressive proposals leave big, lingering concerns for American industry and workers.\n\nIndeed, it’s high time for America’s closest neighbors to take the crisis at our border seriously. But no matter our best intentions, tariffs are bad policy. As Sen. Rand Paul put it: “Tariffs are simply taxes. … Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.”\n\nRepublicans ought to be clear-eyed about the full, unadulterated impact of tariffs as we work to restore sound fiscal policy to our government.\n\nBlanket tariffs make it more expensive to do business in America, driving up costs for consumers across the board.

One estimate suggests the president’s tariffs could cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 each year. And it’s not just about rising prices here at home.\n\nDuring the last Trump administration, retaliatory tariffs from trade partners set off a broader trade war that hit wide swaths of American industry, from agriculture to manufacturing to aerospace and motor vehicles to distilled spirits. Already, Canada announced retaliatory measures that take direct aim at Kentucky production, targeting products like peanut butter and whiskey.\n\nHundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are tied up, directly or indirectly, in trade with Canada and Mexico. Our neighbors to the north and south buy over half a trillion dollars’ worth of our goods and services each year ‒ including nearly $10 billion in manufactured goods and $300 million in agricultural exports from Kentucky alone.\n\nThese economic tailwinds touch virtually every family and every industry.\n\nInternational trade is a two-way street\n\nAmerica’s open markets also fuel billions in capital investment from businesses abroad. In Kentucky, more than 60% of all counties are home to at least one international business. These are industrial suppliers, auto manufacturers and makers of consumer goods from across the world that support roughly 100,000 jobs in the commonwealth.\n\nThese investments don’t happen on their own. Foreign businesses choose America because they can count on our commitment to free markets and free enterprise. Sudden shifts to protectionism undermine the certainty these companies rely on to do business in the United States.\n\nWhen we engage with our allies and partners, we unlock new sources of economic strength – lower prices, more choices for consumers and greater innovation. And we ought to remind ourselves that trade is a two-way street.\n\nTake our work on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement under the first Trump administration.\n\nThis landmark deal with Canada and Mexico leveled the playing field for American workers, reduced the incentives to ship American jobs to Mexico, and expanded American producers’ access to sell goods to these neighboring markets – including Kentucky-made products like bourbon, cars, aerospace parts and agricultural commodities.\n\nTrade wars with our partners hurt working people the most\n\nThat doesn’t mean the system is perfect.\n\nFor the adversaries coordinating to threaten America’s security and undermine our interests, economic predation is a weapon. And holding China and other anti-competitive countries accountable for predatory practices that abuse our system should absolutely be an urgent priority. We should continue to push back against unfair competition and shore up critical supply chains.\n\nNevertheless, preserving the long-term prosperity of American industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. Trade wars with our partners hurt working people most. And the president has better tools to protect American workers without forcing our families and businesses to absorb higher costs.\n\nAs the president and Republicans work to undo the damage of the past four years, we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad ‒ and reinforce our allies as pillars of American prosperity and security.\n\nAt a time when Americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain.\n\nMitch McConnell is the senior senator of Kentucky.

And factories in all corners of the state depend on global trade to both obtain supplies and sell products.\n\nAt a legislative breakfast over the weekend, Republican Congressman Steve King told northwest Iowa residents that he opposed Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs because of what they could do the agricultural market.\n\n“It will be the '80s all over again,” he said, referencing the 1980s farm crisis that put 10,000 Iowa farms out of operation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe president imposed a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on imported steel at a White House event Thursday. He argues that such a move would protect American metal producers and keep countries like China from dumping below-cost products into the U.S. market.\n\nTrump formalized the tariffs Thursday afternoon, but pledged to offer \"great flexibility\" with the new levy. He will exempt neighboring Canada and Mexico while his administration seeks to negotiate a new North American trade agreement. And he said he may exempt Australia and other nations from the tariff in the future, he said.\n\n\"We just want fairness,\" Trump said. \"We want everything to be reciprocal. And I think in the end, we’re going to have a lot of great jobs, great companies all coming back into our country.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats urged him to reconsider, fearing retaliation from countries across the globe that purchase American-made products and higher prices for U.S. consumers that buy items made with steel and aluminum.\n\nThe entire Iowa congressional delegation wrote to the president Wednesday urging him not to impose the steel and aluminum tariffs. The letter said \"tariffs are a tax on families and hardworking Iowans cannot afford a trade war.\"\n\nThe state economy is heavily dependent on the 3,000-plus factories that dot the state: Iowa is among the top ten states in the nation for its proportion of the workforce employed in factories and the share of gross state product derived from manufacturing, according to the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nSukup Manufacturing, whose 600 employees make iconic grain bins and dryers in rural Iowa, uses 1 million pounds of steel each week.\n\n\"That’s what we do. We do welding and rolling of steel,\" said CFO Steve Sukup. “All our products incorporate steel so it hits at the heart of our base material.”\n\nSukup said the president has been \"doing fantastic\" otherwise, by passing federal tax cuts and reducing factory regulations.\n\n\"This just seems to be a step backward,\" he said. \"I had hoped he would take a broader view of the economic impact, instead of just pushing an increase through on all manufacturing.\"\n\nThough the company sources its steel from U.S. mills in places like Indiana and Pennsylvania, the CFO expects demand for American-made steel to drive prices up if steel imports face a new tariff. And he worries how a trade war could curb demand for Sukup products among farmer and rancher customers. And steel prices have already inched up by 25 percent in the last 90 days, he said.\n\n\"I really hope the administration pulls back from this,\" Sukup said. \"There hasn’t been a trade war we’ve won. And we have the most to lose from it.\"\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs might land the U.S. a more favorable trade deal.\n\n\"President Trump is a unique negotiator. Sometimes, he keeps people off balance. Even his own staff. He certainly did that this last week,\" said Purdue, who was in Des Moines Tuesday to swear in Iowa’s former ag secretary as a federal under secretary in the USDA.\n\nBut farmers worry that big ag trade partners will retaliate, slapping tariffs on Iowa-grown corn, soybeans, pork and beef. Iowa leads the nation in corn production and is behind only Illinois in soybean production.\n\nIowa’s ag economy, already struggling from low commodity prices, is hugely dependent on global trade. Farmers and business leaders are already on edge about the president’s repeated threats to rip apart the North American Free Trade Agreement. Estimates predict Iowa could shed up to 138,000 jobs if the trade agreement were terminated.\n\nTrump's decision to hold off on imposing the tariff in North American countries will no doubt provide some relief for Iowa farmers: Nearly half of Iowa’s exports — $5.6 billion worth — go to Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThough three-quarters of Iowa soybeans are ground into animal feed, national soybean production on the whole still largely relies on export markets. In 2016, about 60 percent of all American-grown soybeans or 2.6 billion bushels were exported, according to the United Soybean Board. Nearly 30 percent of soybean exports went to China.\n\n\"We grow way more than we consume,\" said Grant Kimberley, director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association. \"So we have to export it.\"\n\nWhile Trump has railed against trade deficits, Kimberley noted that strong overseas markets deliver U.S. agriculture a trade surplus.\n\nAgriculture \"has been the shining example of a U.S. trade surplus, which is what the president says he wants,\" he said. \"And its future is being threatened.\"\n\nIowa’s soybean producers have built up overseas markets over the years. And Kimberley says threatening that progress at a time of thin farm profits.\n\n\"There’s more uncertainty. That’s the bottom line,\" he said. “We have been in a downturn in the agricultural economy. \"So this kind of thing doesn’t help improve our optimism about what lies ahead in the future.\"\n\nKimberley hopes former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, now the U.S. ambassador to China, can persuade Trump to reconsider. With deep understanding of Iowa’s ag roots, Branstad has previously favored trade agreements.\n\n\"My hope is people can come to the table,\" Kimberley said, \"and this crisis can be diffused.\"\n\nAside from triggering retaliation, the steel and aluminum tariffs could increase the prices farmers pay for necessary equipment like tractors and combines, said Iowa Corn Growers Association President Mark Recker.\n\n\"Agricultural trade has been a bright spot for U.S. economy, positively impacting our overall trade balance, while providing an important avenue to grow demand for America’s farmers and ranchers,\" Recker said. \"…We are hopeful that the Trump Administration will carefully consider the implications these tariffs may have on America’s agricultural sector.\"\n\nDebi Durham, director of the Iowa Economic Development Authority, said the nation must take targeted action against countries not fulfilling trade obligations. And she advocated for modernizing trade agreements, not making wholesale changes.\n\n\"Sweeping statements about tariffs and trade agreements create unpredictability in the marketplace and could negatively impact key industries in our state,” Durham said in a statement. “Right now, we are seeing businesses start to reinvest in America and Iowa is well positioned to be part of that growth. Our economic development efforts require strong global relationships.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/08"}]}

Some also shared blue hearts and salute emojis indicating they were out at the company.\n\nBy Friday morning, Twitter employees from departments including ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, wellness and other teams had tweeted about having been let go. Members of the curation team, which help elevate reliable information on the platform, including about elections, were also laid off, according to employee posts.\n\n“Just got remotely logged out of my work laptop and removed from Slack,” one Twitter employee said on the platform. “So sad it had to end this way.”\n\nAnother employee said that she and other members of Twitter’s human rights team had been laid off. The employee added that she is proud of the team’s work “to protect those at-risk in global conflicts & crises including Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, and to defend the needs of those particularly at risk of human rights abuse by virtue of their social media presence, such as journalists & human rights defenders.”\n\nSimon Balmain, a former Twitter senior community manager who was laid off Friday, said in an interview with CNN that he lost access to Slack, email and other internal systems around 8 hours before receiving an email Friday morning officially notifying him that he’d been fired. He added that the lay off email “still didn’t provide any details really” about why he’d been let go.\n\n“The waves of annoyance and frustration and all that stuff are absolutely mitigated by the extreme solidarity we’ve seen from people that are in the company, people that are in the same position, people that left the company in years gone by,” Balmain said. “It’s like a giant support network, which has been absolutely amazing.”\n\nOne Twitter employee who was laid off told CNN Friday that some workers are relieved to have been let go. “For me, being safe would’ve been punishment,” the employee said.\n\nWhile Twitter employees were posting about being laid off, Musk on Friday appeared for a friendly interview at an investor conference and spoke about making cheaper electric vehicles and his ambitions to go to Mars. During the interview, Musk said of Twitter, “I tried to get out of the deal,” but then added, “I think there is a tremendous amount of potential … and I think it could be one of the most valuable companies in the world.”\n\nThe interviewer said that Musk had laid off “half of Twitter” and Musk nodded, although he did not comment on the remark.\n\n(In a series of tweets Friday evening, Yoel Roth, head of Twitter’s trust and safety team, confirmed overall headcount was cut by roughly 50%. The layoffs eliminated 15% of the company’s trust and safety team, leading to reductions in customer service but little change to content moderation, according to Roth. )\n\nIn his interview, Musk appeared to frame the sweeping layoffs as necessary for a company that, like other social media firms, was experiencing “revenue challenges” prior to his acquisition as advertisers rethink spending amid recession fears.\n\nMusk also said “a number of major advertisers have stopped spending on Twitter” in the days since the acquisition was completed.\n\nElon Musk spoke at an investment conference Friday morning as employees at Twitter, which he now owns, were receiving notifications that they had been laid off from the company. Baron Capital\n\nTwitter had about 7,500 workers prior to Musk’s takeover, meaning roughly 3,700 employees were laid off. The cuts come as Musk attempts to improve the company’s bottom line after taking out significant debt financing to fund his $44 billion acquisition.\n\nThe email sent Thursday evening notified employees that they would receive a notice by 12 p.m. ET Friday that informs them of their employment status.\n\n“If your employment is not impacted, you will receive a notification via your Twitter email,” a copy of the email obtained by CNN said. “If your employment is impacted, you will receive a notification with next steps via your personal email.”\n\nThe email added that “to help ensure the safety” of employees and Twitter’s systems, the company’s offices “will be temporarily closed and all badge access will be suspended.”\n\nThe email concluded acknowledging that it will be “an incredibly challenging experience to go through” for the workforce.\n\nSeveral Twitter employees on Thursday night filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Twitter is in violation of the federal and California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) after laying off some employees already. The complaint was later amended to acknowledge that while several of the plaintiffs did ultimately receive sufficient notice of their termination under the WARN Act, Twitter still allegedly failed to give sufficient notice in the case of some employees.\n\nThe WARN Act requires that an employer with more than 100 employees must provide 60 days’ advanced written notice prior to a mass layoff “affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment.”\n\n“Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has made clear that he believes complying with federal labor laws is ‘trivial,’” Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement to CNN. “We have filed this federal complaint to ensure that Twitter be held accountable to our laws and to prevent Twitter employees from unknowingly signing away their rights.”\n\nWARN notices were filed by Twitter on Friday for nearly 1,000 impacted employees at the company’s various California offices.\n\nSeparately, other labor lawyers told CNN Friday they had begun receiving inquiries from Twitter employees questioning whether their terminations may have been unlawfully discriminatory or retaliatory.\n\n“Former Twitter employees have reached out to us regarding their layoffs and their circumstances, and so we’re looking at all the issues — beyond appropriate notice — and to make sure the employee wasn’t laid off due to their membership in a protected category,” said Chauniqua Young, a partner at the law firm Outten & Golden.\n\nBeyond the potential for lawsuits arising from the layoffs, other legal experts say Musk’s handling of the cuts may well create further problems for him down the road — whether in terms of attracting future talent or by keeping remaining workers satisfied.\n\n“Once you treat people like this, they remember that,” said Terri Gerstein, a fellow at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program and Economic Policy Institute. “Of the people remaining, it is a certainty that none of them feel secure in their job, and I would be shocked if the remaining people were not updating their resumes right now or talking with each other about starting a union.”\n\nMusk started his tenure at Twitter by firing CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision.\n\nAnd in less than a week since Musk acquired the company, its C-suite appears to have almost entirely cleared out, through a mix of firings and resignations. Musk has also dissolved Twitter’s former board of directors.\n\nMany staffers on Friday summed up their feelings with a hashtag, #LoveWhereYouWorked, a past-tense play on one previously often used by Twitter employees.\n\n- Brian Fung and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/tech/elon-musk-deal-termination-twitter-response/index.html", "title": "Twitter's legal team calls Elon Musk's attempt to exit acquisition deal ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk wants to cancel his deal to buy Twitter, but the social media company is having none of it.\n\nOn Friday, Musk moved to terminate the $44-billion acquisition agreement, alleging that Twitter breached the deal by failing to hand over data he says he needs to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform. Twitter’s legal representatives hit back in a letter to Musk’s lawyers Sunday, calling the billionaire’s claims “invalid” and demanding that Musk follow through with the takeover.\n\n“Mr. Musk’s and the other Musk Parties’ purported termination is invalid and wrongful, and it constitutes a repudiation of their obligations under the Agreement,” reads the letter, which was signed William Savit, a lawyer at Wachtell, Rosen, Lipton and Katz, which is representing Twitter in the dispute. The letter was disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday.\n\nMusk has for weeks expressed concerns, without any apparent evidence, that there are a greater number of bots and spam accounts on the platform than Twitter has said publicly. In his Friday letter, his lawyer alleged that Twitter has “not complied with its contractual obligations” to provide Musk with sufficient data to evaluate the issue, despite having handed over its “firehose” of tweets on the platform.\n\nIn its Monday response, the Twitter team said that, “Twitter has breached none of its obligations,” and alleged instead that Musk has “knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breached the Agreement.” It added that Twitter has and will continue to “provide information reasonably requested” by Musk to close the transaction.\n\n“The Agreement is not terminated, the Bank Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter remain in effect, and Twitter demands that Mr. Musk and the other Musk Parties comply with their obligations under the Agreement,” the letter states.\n\nUnless Musk backs down or a settlement is reached, the dispute appears almost certain to end up in court. Following Musk’s announcement that he wanted to exit the deal, Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday that the board is “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.”\n\n“We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,” Taylor added. It does not appear that a formal suit has yet been filed.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter (TWTR) stock tanked on the news of the dispute, closing down more than 11% on Monday — nearly 40% below Musk’s deal price, suggesting deep skepticism about the deal going through. Many analysts have suggested that Musk may be trying to use the bot issue as a pretext to get out of a deal that appears overpriced in light of the recent market downturn. Tesla (TSLA) shares, which Musk is planning to use in part to finance the deal, have also fallen in recent weeks.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/tech/elon-musk-twitter-bot-analysis-cyabra/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk commissioned this bot analysis in his fight with Twitter ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSpam and fake accounts are more prevalent on Twitter than on comparable social platforms, according to a data analysis firm hired by Elon Musk as part of his legal battle with Twitter.\n\nThe claim by Cyabra — in the company’s first public interview since conducting a study commissioned by Musk that found spam and bot accounts make up an estimated 11% of Twitter’s total user base — highlights the headache that may await Musk now that he appears ready to complete his $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform.\n\nCyabra CEO Dan Brahmy told CNN last week that in addition to studying Twitter (TWTR), his company has done similar assessments of the company’s rivals — although he declined to name any specific platforms — and that the fake-account problem appears to be comparatively worse for Twitter (TWTR) than its peers. Using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes “hundreds” of parameters, he said, Cyabra provides estimates of whether certain online accounts and content are authentic.\n\n“We have a number for all the social media platforms, because that’s our job,” he said, adding that Cyabra’s estimate for Twitter is “definitely not in the low end” relative to its competitors (although the company had more access to data about Twitter when it conducted its analysis for Musk).\n\nBots on Twitter have been central to the dispute over Musk’s initial attempt to get out of the acquisition deal. Less than three months after signing the deal, and waiving due diligence in the process, Musk moved to terminate the agreement, citing claims that Twitter had misstated the number of bots on its platform, despite having previously said that he wanted to buy the company to address its bot problem.\n\nTwitter has for years said that bots make up less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users (mDAU). In a series of tweets in May, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal acknowledged that “spam harms the experience for real people on Twitter,” and added that, “as such, we are strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day.”\n\nTwitter sued Musk to complete the deal, accusing him of using bots as a pretext to exit the deal after getting buyer’s remorse, and the deal was set to go to trial later this month. But last week, Musk told Twitter he is now ready to move ahead with the deal at the original price, and the judge overseeing the case gave the two sides until Oct. 28 to close the deal or face trial.\n\nThe dispute over the true number of fake accounts on Twitter — and how to accurately calculate it — has also shone a spotlight on the small army of data scientists, artificial intelligence experts and misinformation researchers both within and outside tech companies who spend their days hunting for patterns or anomalies that can uncover whether a given account, or a network of accounts, represents a living, breathing human being or, potentially, automated accounts or bad actors aiming to spread covert influence, false information or spam.\n\nWith Musk and Twitter now expected to close the acquisition deal, the public may never get a close look at the evidence each side gathered on the issue or a court ruling on Musk’s claims that bots are more pervasive on the platform than it has let on. But Cyabra is coming forward now, Brahmy said, after the company’s work for Musk’s team was revealed in court filings and hearings in the acquisition dispute. The Israel-based company has roughly 40 employees and counts the US State Department and various consumer brands as customers of its digital authenticity measurement tools, he said. Among its investors is the Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund.\n\nMany practitioners in the field caution that estimating spam or fake accounts can be an extremely subjective exercise, and that anyone claiming to have a definite number likely doesn’t grasp the complexity of the issue. Even the creator of Botometer, another service Musk used to estimate of the number of bots on Twitter, has emphasized the challenges behind defining the term “bot” and cautioned that context, intent and even the way an account is managed can complicate matters. There are also good bots designed to share information or entertaining content that are allowed on Twitter and many of which transparently self-identify as automated on the platform.\n\nIn the interview last week prior to the revived deal talks, Brahmy acknowledged there are clear limits to his company’s use of machine learning algorithms to determine whether accounts may be authentic, which is why his firm’s report about Twitter expresses a maximum confidence level of about 80%. The company’s algorithms would likely flag Brahmy’s own grandmother as a suspicious account holder, he said, given her propensity to whiplash randomly from topic to topic and to post at unusual hours with numerous grammatical mistakes.\n\nTwitter declined to comment for this story.\n\nTwitter lawyers in a hearing earlier this month said that neither Cyabra’s analysis, nor an analysis Musk commissioned by another firm that estimated with 90% confidence that bots make up 5.3% of the platform’s user base, support Musk’s claim in his deal termination letter that the amount of spam is “wildly higher than the Twitter estimate” of less than 5% of mDAU.\n\nCyabra’s analysis\n\nCyabra first made waves in May, after Musk’s deal was first announced. Using publicly available data, the company claimed at the time that spam and bot accounts represented 13.7% of accounts on Twitter. Soon thereafter, the company was hired by Musk’s team to perform a second analysis, this time based on the “firehose” of data that Twitter had provided directly to the Tesla CEO, according to Brahmy.\n\nThat second analysis, which has since been referenced in court filings, concluded with roughly 80% confidence that spam and bot accounts represent 11% of Twitter’s total user base. The finding offers a look at the hurdle Musk may face if he takes over Twitter after previously saying he wanted to “defeat the spam bots or die trying.”\n\n“The request was precise: Spam and bot accounts, tell us the number, tell us the methodologies and tell us the confidence level,” Brahmy said. Brahmy said Cyabra did not work with the other data analysis firms used by Musk’s team, and he declined to discuss whether or how much Cyabra was paid to perform the commissioned analysis.\n\nThe finding can’t be compared directly to Twitter’s own estimate that fake and spam accounts comprise less than 5% of mDAU — Brahmy said Cyabra was unable to make an estimate of the prevalence of bots as a percentage of mDAU rather than total Twitter users. He declined to elaborate on why, but it may be due to the fact that Twitter’s firehose of data used to conduct the analysis does not show which accounts are or aren’t considered mDAU and only shows those accounts that actively tweet rather than those who, for example, only use the platform to read tweets.\n\n(For its part, Twitter’s disclosures about spam and fake accounts note that its calculation relies on “significant judgment” and the company has not made claims about how the prevalence of such accounts on its platform compares to competitors.)\n\nFactors built into Cyabra’s algorithm used to measure how likely an account is to be fake or spam include the members in that account’s social network and where they’re located; what the account talks about, how frequently and at what hours; whether the account uses one or multiple languages and how fluently it uses those languages; and the type of engagement the account’s content tends to generate, among many others.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/tech/elon-musk-twitter-board/index.html", "title": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk will not join Twitter's board | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently became Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, has decided not to join the social media company’s board.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted the news Sunday night.\n\n“Elon’s appointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9, but Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board,” Agrawal said in the tweet. “I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.”\n\nA Twitter spokesperson confirmed Musk decided not to join the Twitter board and referred to Agrawal’s statement.\n\nThe development comes less than a week after the Tesla and SpaceX founder disclosed that he had purchased a more than 9% stake in the company, and Twitter (TWTR) said in a regulatory filing that it planned to appoint Musk to its board for a term ending in 2024. Both Musk and Twitter (TWTR)’s leadership had expressed excitement about his addition to the board.\n\nMusk tweeted Tuesday that he was “looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!” And Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said that Musk and Agrawal would make “an incredible team.” Twitter’s stock surged after his initial purchase was disclosed.\n\nAs part of his agreement to join the board, the Musk had committed to not acquiring more than 14.9% of the company’s shares during his term. Some corporate governance experts suggested that the move could have been a way of reining in Musk’s influence over the company. Now, that limitation is no longer in place, leaving the door open for Musk to potentially take a more aggressive stance by buying up more of Twitter’s shares.\n\nIn his tweet Sunday night announcing Musk’s reversal, Agrawal said the company’s board had “believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward.”\n\nCorporate board members also typically share their suggestions for the company privately, which might have meant Musk would have had to stop tweeting about his ideas for Twitter. The announcement that Musk would no longer join the board came after he posted a series of tweets about the company over the weekend, including one in which he suggested removing the “w” from “Twitter” — an apparent crude joke that has since been deleted — and another in which he asked if Twitter is “dying” because some of its most-followed accounts don’t often tweet.\n\n“In our opinion, the Twitter Board and Musk could not come to an agreement around Musk’s communications with the public (various polls) over Twitter as he likely needed to take a more back seat/quiet stance as part of joining the Board,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an investor note Monday. He added that Musk’s relationship with Twitter may now become “a ‘Game of Thrones’ battle between Musk and Twitter with the high likelihood that Elon takes a more hostile stance towards Twitter and further builds his active stake in the company.”\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what changes Musk was — or perhaps still is — seeking for Twitter. In recent weeks, Musk suggested on Twitter that the platform does not allow free enough speech, and said it should make its algorithm open source. He also polled his followers last week about whether they “want an edit button,” a longtime feature request, if a divisive one, from many Twitter users. (Twitter said last week it has been working on an edit feature for the past year.)\n\nMusk has not tweeted about his decision.

Is National Hurricane Center ...", "text": "In just two weeks, Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has swept through at least half a dozen federal agencies with the same explosive, around-the-clock energy and tactics he used when taking over Twitter and Tesla: move fast, work long hours, slash expenses, eliminate anything he considers wasteful or unnecessary, and fire some workers while encouraging workers to resign with promises of pay to reduce the workforce.\n\nIs NOAA next? Will Florida lose its hurricane forecasts, or be required to pay for them?\n\nUnder Musk and his team of young aides, the advisory group the administration calls the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has pushed itself into highly sensitive agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Treasury, and the General Services Administration, gained access to highly personal information and made sweeping changes that congressional Democrats and federal officials have said were done without Congressional approval or any apparent oversight.\n\nOn Saturday, the website for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the country's foreign aid agency, went dark and the agency was dismantled with the remains moved under Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Thousands of employees were notified they would be placed on administrative leave. \"We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,\" Musk posted Monday.\n\nMusk, who donated $288 million to Trump's campaign, has said DOGE's goals are to downsize the federal government, eliminate federal programs and the jobs of their workers, and slash regulations. He's attacked these goals with breakneck speed and bragged about on the social media site he owns, X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Very few in the bureaucracy actually work the weekend,\" Musk posted on X, \"so it’s like the opposing team just leaves the field for 2 days!”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, DOGE staffers reportedly entered the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring, Maryland, according to the Guardian.\n\nWhat is NOAA?\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a scientific and regulatory agency, is tasked with gathering, sharing and implementing the latest scientific data and analytic tools using a vast network of research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, scientists and experts to understand and predict climate and extreme weather impacts. Data from NOAA and its agencies inform weather predictions, fisheries management, coastal restoration and marine commerce.\n\nNOAA oversees the National Weather Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations & NOAA Corps. The National Hurricane Center is a division of the NOAA/National Weather Service.\n\nWill the Trump administration and Musk remove NOAA and the National Hurricane Center?\n\nNo details have been released about any plans concerning NOAA, but Trump has frequently dismissed climate science and the threat of climate change, something NOAA has extensively researched.\n\nIn his first term, Trump proposed slashing NOAA's budget by 18% and the agency's weather and climate research office by 43% and removed the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement. The Trump administration removed the Environmental Protection Agency's webpages on climate change and worked to downplay or dismiss studies into it, according to whistleblowers who talked to the Guardian.\n\nNow Trump and his allies have vowed to remove any mentions of climate change from the federal government. On the first day of his presidency, Trump rescinded 78 executive orders approved by former President Joe Biden that included efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and he signed an executive order leaving the Paris Climate Agreement again.\n\nIn his first week, Trump ordered federal departments to scrub references to topics that do not fit his priorities, such as mentions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and climate change. Pages referencing climate change at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency were removed or left unlinked. Fox News reported.\n\nAnd Project 2025 takes direct aim at NOAA.\n\nWhat does Project 2025 say about NOAA?\n\nProject 2025, a detailed conservative roadmap for Trump's first 100 days in office, calls out the NOAA specifically for \"climate alarmism\" and recommends the agency be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"\n\nAmong other things, Project 2025 suggests:\n\nBreaking up NOAA and reassigning the ships and planes used by NOAA to other agencies\n\nCharging for currently free National Weather Service data\n\nTransfer NOS Survey functions to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Geological Survey\n\nStreamline the National Marine Fisheries Service and reduce or remove regulations on fisheries, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.\n\nDownsize the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and disband the bulk of its climate change research.\n\nDoes Project 2025 call for closing the National Hurricane Center?\n\nNo. The project says the department's data provides \"important public safety and business functions as well as academic functions, and are used by forecasting agencies and scientists internationally.\"\n\nHowever, the project does call for a review of all data from the National Hurricane Service and the National Environmental Satellite Service to ensure it is presented neutrally, \"without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate.\"\n\nIs Trump or Musk following Project 2025?\n\nIt is uncertain whether Trump or Musk would agree with the project's recommendation.\n\nWhile Project 2025, released last year by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, is not an official Trump administration blueprint and the president denied any connection with it during his campaign. More than 30 of the project's 38 creators were connected with the previous Trump administration, several members of his new administration have ties to it including Russell Vought, one of the co-authors and Trump's pick for Office of Management and Budget.\n\nMany policies Trump and Musk have enacted in the past two weeks mirror, if not surpass some of Project 2025's suggestions.\n\nThe multi-pronged Presidential Transition Project was intended to assist a Republican president in the early days of his or her new presidency to \"rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left.\"\n\nAs of early Wednesday afternoon, the climate change section on NOAA's website and its standalone site climate.gov are still visible.\n\nTrump nominates 'Sharpiegate' scientist to lead NOAA\n\nThis week, Trump nominated Dr. Neil Jacobs to lead NOAA.\n\nJacobs was Trump's acting NOAA chief in 2019 when Trump seemingly altered a hurricane impact map with a Sharpie, adding a crude black loop into Alabama and doubling down on his prediction as to where Hurricane Dorian might go after meteorologists contradicted him. Jacobs reproved them, eventually leading to a Department of Commerce inspector general's report on what became known as Sharpiegate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Union of Concerned Scientists spoke out against his nomination.\n\n“While Dr. Jacobs has relevant expertise and credentials, he has already proven he’s unfit to lead NOAA by failing to uphold scientific integrity at the agency,\" said Dr. Rachel Cleetus, the policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.\n\nWhat has Elon Musk done to the federal government?\n\nSo far, Musk and his team have reportedly:\n\n\"If we were watching this happen in Venezuela or Malawi and we saw a billionaire seize the money supply and the checkbook of the government, we would call it a coup,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative economic policy group and a former Senate senior economic policy advisor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/tech/twitter-eu-compliance-warning/index.html", "title": "Twitter must comply with Europe's platform rules, EU digital chief ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nA top European Union official warned Twitter owner Elon Musk on Wednesday that the social media platform must take significant steps to comply with EU content moderation laws, and that European officials will be monitoring closely for compliance.\n\nTwitter has “huge work ahead” to meet its obligations under the Digital Services Act, Europe’s new platform regulation, said Thierry Breton, the EU’s digital chief, in a readout of his meeting with Musk.\n\n“Twitter will have to implement transparent user policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech, tackle disinformation with resolve, and limit targeted advertising,” Breton said in a statement. “All of this requires sufficient AI and human resources, both in volumes and skills. I look forward to progress in all these areas and we will come to assess Twitter’s readiness on site.”\n\nDuring Wednesday’s meeting, Musk agreed to let EU officials “stress test” the social media platform for compliance with the DSA early next year, Breton added. The testing, which will be performed at Twitter’s headquarters in early 2023, will provide ample opportunity for Twitter to make changes in order to meet any legal deadlines and to prepare for an independent audit of the company’s practices, Breton’s office added.\n\nEuropean commissioner for internal market Thierry Breton (L) attends the weekly College meeting at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on November 9, 2022.

The biggest companies that violate the law could face billions in fines.\n\nThe meeting between Breton and Musk follows an earlier discussion the two had in May in which Musk expressed support for the European regulations.\n\nIn a blog post Wednesday, Twitter said none of its policies have changed since Musk took over the company, and that its trust and safety team “remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.” Content that violates Twitter’s rules, it added, will be demoted on the platform.\n\nSince his purchase of Twitter, however, Musk has restored numerous accounts suspended for earlier violations of Twitter’s rules, including that of former President Donald Trump, and relaxed enforcement of Twitter’s terms, including by ending enforcement of Twitter’s Covid-19 misinformation policies.\n\nIn addition to EU scrutiny, Musk’s Twitter could also face additional pressure at home. At a conference on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she “misspoke” when she previously said she sees “no basis” to investigate Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, which included financing from a Saudi prince. Yellen added that it could be appropriate for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review Musk’s Twitter takeover.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/tech/mastodon/index.html", "title": "With Twitter in chaos, Mastodon is on fire | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn the week since Elon Musk took over Twitter, the number of people signing up for a small social network called Mastodon has surged.\n\nYou may not have heard of Mastodon, which has been around since 2016, but now it’s growing rapidly. Some are fleeing Twitter for it or at least seeking out a second place to post their thoughts online as the much more well-known social network faces layoffs, controversial product changes, an expected shift in its approach to content moderation and a jump in hateful rhetoric.\n\nThere may be no clear alternative to Twitter, a uniquely influential platform that is fast-moving, text-heavy, conversational and news-oriented. But Mastodon scratches a certain itch. The service has a similar look to Twitter, with a timeline of short updates sorted chronologically rather than algorithmically. It lets users join a slew of different servers run by various groups and individuals, rather than one central platform controlled by a single company like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nUnlike larger social networks, Mastodon is both free to use and free of ads. It’s developed by a nonprofit run by Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko, and is supported via crowdfunding.\n\nMastodon is a free open source software for running self-hosted social networking services. Ascannio/Adobe Stock\n\nRochko said in an interview Thursday that Mastodon gained 230,000 users since October 27, when Musk took control of Twitter. It now has 655,000 active users each month, he said. Twitter reported in July that it had nearly 238 million daily active monetizable users.\n\n“It is not as large as Twitter, obviously, but it is the biggest that this network has ever been,” said Rochko, who originally created Mastodon as more of a project than a consumer product (and, yes, its name was inspired by the heavy metal band Mastodon).\n\nWho’s joining Mastodon?\n\nMastodon’s new sign-ups include some Twitter users with big followings, such as actor and comedian Kathy Griffin, who joined in early November, and journalist Molly Jong-Fast, who joined in late October.\n\nSarah T. Roberts, an associate professor at UCLA and faculty director of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, started using Mastodon in earnest on October 30, just after Musk took over Twitter. (She had created another account years ago, she said, but didn’t really get into it until recently because of the popularity of Twitter among people in academia.)\n\nRoberts, who worked at Twitter as a staff researcher earlier this year while taking a leave from UCLA, said she was inspired to start using Mastodon due to concerns about how Twitter’s content moderation may change under Musk’s control. She suspects some newcomers are simply sick of social media companies that capture lots of user data and are driven by advertising.\n\nAnd she pointed out that Twitter users may migrate to Mastodon in particular because its user experience is pretty similar to Twitter’s. A lot of Mastodon’s features and layout (particularly in its iOS app) will look and feel familiar to current Twitter users, though with some slightly different verbiage; you can follow others, create short posts (there’s a 500 character limit, and you can upload images and videos), favorite or repost other users’ posts, and so on.\n\n“It’s about as close as it gets,” she said.\n\nFeeling like a social-media newcomer\n\nI’ve been a Twitter user since 2007, but as a growing number of the people I follow on the social network began posting their Mastodon usernames in recent weeks, I got curious. This week, I decided to check out Mastodon for myself.\n\nThere are some key differences, particularly in how the network is set up. Because Mastodon users’ accounts are hosted on a slew of different servers, the costs of hosting users is spread among many different people and groups. But that also means users are spread out all over the place, and people you know can be hard to find — Rochko likened this setup to having different email providers, like Gmail and Hotmail.\n\nThis means the entirety of the network isn’t under any one person or company’s control, but it also introduces some new complications for those of us used to Twitter — a product that has also been criticized over the years for being less intuitive than more popular services like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nOn Mastodon, for instance, you have to join a specific server to sign up, some of which are open to anyone, some of which require an invitation (you can also run your own server). There is a server operated by the nonprofit behind Mastodon, Mastodon.social, but it’s not accepting more users; I’m currently using one called Mstdn.social, which is also where I can sign in to access Mastodon on the web.\n\nAnd while you can follow any other Mastodon user, no matter which server they’ve signed up with, you can only see the lists of who follows your Mastodon friends, or who your Mastodon friends follow, if the followers happen to belong to the same server you’re signed up with (I realized this while trying to track down more people I know who recently signed up).\n\nAt first, it felt as if I was starting over, in a sense, as a complete newcomer to social media. As Roberts said, it is quite similar to Twitter in terms of its look and functionality, and the iOS app is easy to use.\n\nBut unlike on Twitter, where I can easily interact with a large audience, my Mastodon network is less than 100 followers. Suddenly I had no idea what to post — a feeling that never nags me on Twitter, perhaps because the size of that network makes any post feel less consequential. I got over it quickly, though, and realized the smaller scale of Mastodon can be calming compared to Twitter’s endless stream of stimulation.\n\nA social-media escape hatch\n\nI’m not quite ready to close my Twitter account, though; for me, Mastodon is a sort of social-media escape hatch in case Twitter becomes unbearable.\n\nRoberts, too, hasn’t yet decided if she will close her Twitter account, but she was surprised by how quickly her following grew on Mastodon. Within a week of signing up and alerting her nearly 23,000 Twitter followers, she has amassed over 1,000 Mastodon followers.\n\n“It might be pretty soon that people don’t want to be caught on Twitter,” she said.\n\nIn some ways, starting over can also be fun.\n\n“I thought, ‘What’s it going to be like to start over again?’” she asked. “It’s kind of interesting: Oh that person is here! Here’s so-and-so! I’m so glad they’re here so we can be here together.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/01/13/elon-musk-tesla-motors-detroit-auto-show-naias-north-american-international-auto-show/21637107/", "title": "The cult of Elon Musk: Tesla founder comes to Detroit", "text": "By Nathan Bomey\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nElon Musk eschews typical auto industry parameters%2C embracing the provocative.\n\nHis active Twitter account generates buzz and influences the market.\n\nThe personality cult of Elon Musk views him as a righteous disruptor of a staid auto industry.\n\nFor many industry executives, he's a thorn in their side and an unrealistic dreamer, if not someone to be admired for his audacious vision.\n\nThe two portraits make the founder of Silicon Valley's Tesla Motors perhaps the most polarizing person in Detroit this week.\n\nTwo years since his last trip to the Motor City, Musk will speak this afternoon to the Automotive News World Congress at the Renaissance Center. Tesla Motors has enjoyed a remarkable run since his last visit, prompting one prominent stock analyst to call Tesla \"the world's most important car company.\"\n\nMuch of the growth is pegged directly to the sheer force of Musk's personality. Put simply, the billionaire entrepreneur from South Africa does things differently than the rest of the industry.\n\nHis maverick strand of social media activity invariably generates a firestorm of publicity, even when he's crafting dubious ideas like a rail system that could transport people across the country in a few hours, a creation he dubbed the \"hyperloop.\"\n\nNot averse to blasting the traditional auto industry or firing his own deputies, Musk's appearance in Detroit will inevitably serve to highlight the differences between the Musk way and the Detroit way.\n\nUnlike most Detroit Three executives — or, for that matter, leaders of the German or Asian automakers — Musk likes to be provocative. For example, he once derided Toyota's investments in hydrogen fuel cell cars, calling the technology \"fool cells.\" Last January he took aim at federal regulators — an absolute no-no among traditional auto executives — tweeting that \"the word 'recall' needs to be recalled.\"\n\nHis penchant for the sensational only adds to the Musk legend. As a co-founder of online payments service PayPal and the space-travel company SpaceX, where he's still the chief product champion and architect, Musk is unquestionably among the greatest innovators in the world — and thus his remarks are viewed as pure gospel among technologists.\n\n\"All the people that worship at the church of Musk will come at you with a pitchfork if you say something bad,\" said Dave Sullivan, an analyst with AutoPacific, who said he's been accosted for questioning the company online. \"They're believers.\"\n\nTesla growth\n\nThe cult is growing. The company said in November that deliveries of its only vehicle, the Model S electric sedan, would soar 50% in 2014 to about 33,000 units. Tesla, which does not release monthly sales figures like the rest of the industry, projected another 50% increase in 2015.\n\nTesla's stock soared 48% in 2014 to finish the year at $222.41, though it was a bumpy ride along the way. The shares rumbled through a series of wild fluctuations, hitting a low of $136.37 and reaching a high of $291.42.\n\nThe company's luxury electric cars range in price from about $71,000 to more than $100,000, with driving range of 208 to 253 miles. The Model S has earned a bevy of critical praise for its sleek design and battery range.\n\nBoston area resident Chris Hansen last summer drove his Model S from his East Coast home to his cottage in Interlochen, Mich., plotting strategic stops to ensure the car maintains a charge. He said Musk's breakthroughs have appropriately unsettled the auto industry.\n\n\"Some people might even call him a mad scientist, but the mad science is clearly working,\" Hansen said. \"He's clearly a genius, and I think he scares some people with how brilliant he is. There are people out there who are genuinely afraid of what he might do. But I think people are also simultaneously starting to believe.\"\n\nIn many cases, the believers include influential industry leaders. For example, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas, whose reports regularly move the market, recently gushed about \"Elon's infectious enthusiasm\" and said \"we can only imagine\" what the company will do next.\n\nOnline engagement\n\nThe believers, however, do not include U.S. auto dealers, who have lobbied politicians to block the automaker from selling cars directly to consumers through company-owned stores instead of franchised dealerships.\n\nMichigan's state Legislature in October passed a bill ensuring Tesla cannot open its own stores in the state, and Gov. Rick Snyder signed it into law. The governor insisted that the bill only clarified existing laws and suggested he might be open to a change in the future.\n\nMusk has regularly taken aim at politicians who seek to undercut Tesla's momentum, so it would come as no surprise if he uses the platform in Detroit to excoriate the state of Michigan for its actions.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said the format of Musk's appearance in Detroit is a Q-and-A, so he won't have prepared remarks.\n\n\"Nobody knows exactly what he's going to talk about. That's part of his schtick,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. \"The risks in this is the tremendous volatility we've seen in the Tesla stock. It's been up; it's been down.\"\n\nOn Twitter, where he has accumulated an astonishing 1.4 million followers for a CEO, Musk is similarly unpredictable. He's easily the most aggressive and prodigious tweeter among major auto executives, most of whom still avoid the service, and a single Musk tweet can move the market.\n\nFor example, on Oct. 1, he tweeted a mysterious teaser photo with the phrase, \"About time to unveil the D and something else.\"\n\nA feverish buzz ensued. But when the news, revealed in an event Oct. 9, turned out to be a fancy version of an all-wheel-drive system, the buzz fizzled. The stock, which had risen 8% from Oct. 1 to Oct. 9, relinquished most of those gains within a day.\n\nMost traditional auto executives would be aghast if their tweets moved the market. But Musk relishes the opportunity to sway public opinion through social media and to set the record straight.\n\nWhen Morgan Stanley's Jonas, who has called the automaker the \"world's most important car company,\" issued a report last fall suggesting that Tesla's forthcoming Model X crossover might face delays because of problems designing its gull-wing doors, Musk cracked back on Twitter.\n\n\"Rumors about canceling Falcon wing doors are false. At Tesla, the production car will always be better than the show car,\" he tweeted, adding minutes later: \"Really hate it when companies bring out an awesome show car and then you can never actually buy it. So lame.\"\n\nMusk's aggressive approach on Twitter contrasts, for example, with the conservative approach of General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who generally sticks to harmless posts about GM activities.\n\n\"He's a very good public relations person,\" AutoPacific's Sullivan said. \"His Twitter account pretty much sets him apart from everyone else. He seems to wield Twitter as a tool more than just about anybody else on Twitter.\"\n\nGaining respect\n\nIn Detroit, Musk will be the consummate outsider at a conference designed for insiders, the sold-out Automotive News World Congress, which features a range of high-profile auto executives and awards.\n\nAuto insiders have, in some cases begrudgingly, gained a respect for Musk's accomplishments. What was once viewed as impossible — building a brand new car manufacturer from scratch — he proved was doable. GM executives, for example, have studied Tesla's rise and have praised Musk's contributions to the industry.\n\nBut building Tesla into a major global manufacturer is a far more difficult task than creating a luxury electric car company.\n\nTesla has encountered several delays in development of its new crossover, called the Model X, which is now slated to hit production in late 2015, about a year later than once expected. And battery industry experts are skeptical that Musk can deliver on his promise to introduce an affordable electric car, called the Model 3, within a few years.\n\nPeter De Lorenzo, a former auto industry marketing executive who blogs at Autoextremist.com, said Musk should be penalized for failures to deliver on the Model X.\n\n\"He gets a pass. We're beyond the point where he should be getting a free pass for some of this stuff,\" De Lorenzo said. \"I'm not begrudging what he's accomplished, but I think it's been blown far beyond proportion.\"\n\nContact Nathan Bomey: 313-223-4743 or nbomey@freepress.com.

On Monday, Weiss posted a series of screenshots purported to show internal Twitter documents where Roth and others discussed whether to ban Trump’s account, with some employees questioning if the former president’s tweets violated the platform’s policies.\n\nWhile Musk had initially been publicly supportive of Roth, that soon changed after he left the company.\n\nRoth has since been the subject of criticism and threats following the release of the Twitter Files.

Conservative critics have accused Twitter of suppressing the story at the behest of the FBI, something they claim the released communications, dubbed the “Twitter Files,” demonstrate.\n\nMusk himself has alleged the communications show government censorship, suggesting Twitter acted “under orders from the government” when it suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nBut so far, none of the released messages explicitly show the FBI telling Twitter to suppress the story. In fact, the opposite view emerges from sworn testimony by an FBI agent at the center of the controversy. And in interviews with CNN, half a dozen tech executives and senior staff, along with multiple federal officials familiar with the matter, all deny any such directive was given.\n\n“We would never go to a company to say you need to squelch this story,” said one former FBI official who helped oversee the government’s cooperation with companies including Twitter, Google and Facebook.\n\nElon Musk has suggested internal Twitter communications reveal improper behavior by the FBI in its effort to thwart foreign influence campaigns Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nMusk and his conservative allies have insinuated the released messages provide evidence of illicit behavior by the FBI, suggesting the exchange of secret files pertaining to Hunter Biden, and improper payments made to Twitter. But CNN’s interviews with people directly involved with the interactions and with those who have reviewed the documents disprove those claims.\n\nMatt Taibbi, one of the journalists Musk tapped this month to comb through Twitter internal messages for evidence of free speech violations, said himself on December 2 that “there is no evidence - that I’ve seen - of any government involvement in the laptop story.”\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that following Russia’s meddling campaign in 2016, plus after years of interactions with federal agents about how to spot foreign disinformation efforts, Twitter executives were hyper suspicious of anything that looked like foreign influence and were primed to act, even without direction from the government.\n\nBy the time the New York Post published its laptop story on October 14, 2020, Yoel Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, had spent two years meeting with the FBI and other government officials. He was prepared for some kind of hack and leak operation.\n\n“There were lots of reasons why the entire industry was on alert,” Roth said at a conference in November, not long after he resigned from Twitter. Roth insists he was not in favor of blocking the story and thought the company’s decision was a mistake.\n\nAs the released communications show, Twitter initially acted to suppress the story for a few days in part out of concerns that Hunter Biden, the son of the then-Democratic presidential candidate, was being targeted as part of a foreign election interference operation similar to the one Russia carried out in 2016.\n\nWhat Twitter did not know at the time was that Hunter Biden was the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Since as early as 2018, the Justice Department has been investigating Hunter Biden for his business activities in foreign countries. In late 2019, nearly a year before the story first emerged in the New York Post, the FBI had used a subpoena to obtain a laptop that Biden allegedly left behind at a Delaware computer repair store.\n\nAccording to sources at the FBI and at Twitter who spoke to CNN, none of that information was disclosed to Twitter executives trying to decide how to treat the laptop story, nor to anyone else for that matter.\n\n“It was an ongoing investigation, so I would never approve of talking about it,” said the former FBI official.\n\nGOP scrutiny\n\nWhile the released Twitter messages have yet to reveal a smoking gun showing the government ordered a social media company to suppress a story, Republicans on Capitol Hill say there are enough questions raised by the internal communications to merit calling tech executives to testify.\n\nScrutiny is building around the role of Twitter’s recently-fired deputy general counsel James Baker, a former top FBI official who joined Twitter in the summer of 2020. The released documents show Baker was in regular contact with his former colleagues at the FBI, giving rise to rampant accusations from conservatives that he was the conduit for the government to pressure Twitter.\n\nIn some of the material released by Twitter, an email shows Baker setting up a meeting – in the midst of Twitter’s internal deliberations about how to handle the New York Post story – with Matthew Perry, an attorney in the FBI’s Office of General Counsel. It is not clear what the two discussed.\n\nThe FBI declined to discuss any communications Baker had with FBI officials once he arrived at Twitter.\n\nBaker is among a number of former Twitter executives called to testify this month by Republican Rep. James Comer, the incoming chair of the House Oversight Committee. Baker declined to comment for this story.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY) attends a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 27, 2022 Drew Angerer/Getty Images/File\n\nComer also wants to hear from several former US intelligence officials who, days after the laptop story broke, wrote an open letter saying it had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” The group of former officials who signed the letter included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who, as a CNN contributor, appeared on the network to express his view.\n\nThough the former officials admitted, “we do not have evidence of Russian involvement,” their letter set the tone for much of the early discussion and coverage of the laptop.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the FBI said, “The correspondence between the FBI and Twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional, longstanding and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements, which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries. As evidenced in the correspondence, the FBI provides critical information to the private sector in an effort to allow them to protect themselves and their customers.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI work every day to protect the American public. It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.”\n\nAllegations of illicit behavior\n\nAmong the messages given the most attention from Musk and other critics are a series of emails between Roth and Elvis Chan, an FBI special agent based in San Francisco, where he focuses on cybersecurity and foreign influence on social media. On October 13, the day before New York Post story published, Chan instructed Roth to download ten documents on a secure portal.\n\nRoth responded, “received and downloaded – thanks!”\n\nMichael Shellenberger, who is among those Musk has entrusted with access to the internal messages, wrote about the Chan communication with Roth. Shellenberger does not describe the contents of the files, but he does insinuate that the timing of the message suggests Chan was secretly providing Roth information about the Hunter laptop.\n\nAt the FBI’s headquarters in Washington, a team reviewing the internal communications released by Musk says it has identified the 10 documents Chan sent to Roth. “I reviewed all 10 of these documents personally and I can say explicitly there is nothing in these 10 documents about Hunter Biden’s laptop or about any related story to that,” an FBI official involved in the review told CNN.\n\nThe official said eight of the documents pertained to “malign foreign influence actors and activities,” the FBI’s terminology for foreign government election meddling. The official said the other two documents were posts on Twitter the FBI flagged as potential evidence of election-related crimes, such as voter suppression activities.\n\nAnother interaction that has drawn suspicion is an internal message from early 2021 that Shellenberger cites showing that the FBI paid Twitter $3.4 million beginning October 2019. In the message, an unnamed associate emails Baker saying, “I am happy to report we have collected $3,415,323 since October 2019!”\n\nThe FBI says the bureau is obligated under federal law to reimburse companies for the cost they incur to satisfy subpoenas and other legal requests as part of the FBI’s investigative work.\n\nThe FBI describes its discussions with Twitter as the type of information-sharing that Congress and both the Trump and Biden administrations encouraged to help tech companies and social media platforms protect themselves and their users. The released messages appear to show that FBI officials repeatedly noted that it was up to the content moderators at the company to take action if a post violated their rules.\n\n“All the information exchanged is about the actors and their activity,” a second FBI official who reviewed the communications told CNN. “What we are not providing is specifics about the content and the narrative. We are also not directing the platforms to do anything. We are just providing it for them to do as they see fit under their own terms of service to protect their platforms and customers.”\n\nGhosts of 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 election, social media executives knew they had a problem. Russian operatives had used their platforms to run a massive covert influence campaign to help elect Donald Trump, using bots to spread disinformation and sow division among Americans.\n\nTo prepare for the next election, the executives set about bolstering their internal controls, including hiring former law enforcement and intelligence officials. But they also knew they had to forge a closer relationship with the US government to help root out foreign trolls and sources of disinformation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump chats with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in 2017. Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat followed were a series of regular meetings with federal agents that began in May 2018.\n\nThe released communications as well as interviews with people involved in the meetings portray routine, friendly and sometimes tense contacts between company executives and the government officials with whom they regularly interacted. Among the released communications are lively exchanges between Twitter and the FBI, revealing some of the sensitivities — and tensions — at play as the government and Silicon Valley slowly figured out how to work together.\n\nOne former FBI official who spoke to CNN recalls that tech executives would insist on meetings away from their campuses, in part because government agents weren’t welcome. Feelings in Silicon Valley toward the intelligence community were still raw since the Edward Snowden leaks detailed a vast data collection apparatus that targeted the tech companies.\n\n“Early on, who hosted the meeting was also a political football,” said a person familiar with the meetings between the government and Silicon Valley. “Each company wanted someone else to. There were worries about employees seeing a bunch of feds and leaking it in an inaccurate way.”\n\nOne tech source, however, dismissed this and said companies offered their offices for the meetings out of a shared sense of responsibility.\n\nNevertheless, the meetings went ahead. The first one took place at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park. Later meetings were held at Twitter and LinkedIn’s offices, a person familiar with the meetings told CNN.\n\nSome of the early interactions were terse. Reports published by CNN and other news organizations described complaints from some tech executives that the FBI was sharing only limited information, useless to help the companies protect their platforms.\n\nA telling moment came early on when a government lawyer lectured tech executives about the limits on what the government can do to help, multiple people who attended the meeting told CNN. One Silicon Valley executive described how the lawyer gave a 20-minute speech about the First Amendment and insisted that “government representatives can’t tell the companies to take any content down.”\n\nFormer Twitter employees and FBI officials involved say that by 2020, their discussions had become better coordinated and useful to both sides. One indicator of how advantageous the relationship had become: By 2020, Facebook was issuing press releases about some of the discussions.\n\nRumors of a hack-and-leak operation\n\nMusk and other critics of the interactions point to released messages that they claim show a cozy relationship between the government and Twitter. But the messages also show Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, repeatedly pushing back against asks from the FBI.\n\nAt various points, the Twitter communications show Roth resisting pressure to reveal certain information about users absent a formal legal request, such as which third-party VPN services were used by some account-holders to access Twitter.\n\nYoel Roth Patrick Farrell/Knight Foundation\n\nRoth also shut down a request that the company share more of its data with intelligence officials.\n\nOthers within Twitter noted the US government’s interest in Twitter’s data and urged colleagues to “stay connected and keep a solid front against these efforts.”\n\nConservative critics continue to blame Roth for Twitter’s suppression of the laptop story, but he insists he didn’t make the final call and says he thought it was a mistake. “It is widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story,” Roth said last month. “It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue.”\n\nExactly who in Twitter’s leadership ultimately made the call to block the story remains unclear.\n\nIn December 2020, Roth gave a sworn declaration to the Federal Election Commission saying the government had warned of expected hack-and-leak incidents targeting people associated with political campaigns. Roth said that he learned in the meetings with government agencies there were “rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.”\n\nRoth did not point to the government as the source of the rumor, but his claim that law enforcement agencies gave general warnings about disinformation campaigns dovetails with recent testimony from Chan, the FBI agent who played a key role in the meetings.\n\nChan was deposed this year as part of a lawsuit brought by the Missouri attorney general alleging government censorship of social media. Chan disputed that the government told social media companies to “expect” hack-and-leak campaigns, saying that it would have only warned companies it was a possibility.\n\nThat Hunter Biden might be the target of a hack-and-leak operation was being publicly discussed at the time, after it emerged that Burisma Holdings, a company he worked with in Ukraine had reportedly been hacked by Russian military intelligence early in 2020.\n\nChan also testified that government agents never raised Hunter Biden specifically, and that his name came up only when a Facebook analyst asked specifically for relevant information. An FBI agent in the meeting declined to answer, Chan recalled, adding that she was likely not authorized to address the question because at the time the FBI had not publicly confirmed its Hunter Biden investigation.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Donie O'Sullivan Brian Fung", "Evan Perez", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}]}

Ontario backed down.\n\nBut, amid the onslaught of threats and the prospect of economic pain, polls show voters in both border countries are rallying to their defiant leaders.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's approval ratings are sky high – 85% approve of her, while just 15% disapprove – the highest approval rating of any Mexican president in the last three decades, according to a poll from El Financiero conducted from Feb. 13 to 17 and Feb. 20 to 24.\n\nIn Canada, the ruling Liberal Party hadn't led in national polls since February 2021. Now, according to a recent Ipsos survey, they lead the oppositon Conservatives, 38% to 36%.\n\nDefying Trump - a winning strategy\n\nSpeaking to a crowd Sunday after members of the ruling Liberal party selected him as leader − and Canada's next prime minister − Mark Carney didn't mince words. \"The Americans – they should make no mistake. In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" he said to cheers.\n\nAt a massive rally in Mexico City the same day, Sheinbaum took a similar tone.\n\n\"We can’t give up our sovereignty. Our people cannot be affected by decisions made by foreign governments or hegemonies,\" she said.\n\nCanada and Mexico are planning retaliatory tariffs of their own on U.S. goods, and American liquor has been swept off the shelves of Canadian retailers. On Tuesday, Canada backed off on a 25% surcharge the province of Ontario levied on eletricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota and New York after Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.\n\nThreats, announcements, reverals\n\nFor weeks, Trump leveraged the threat of steep tariffs to force concessions from the two countries on border security. Last Monday, he announced that across-the-board 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods would take effect within 24 hours.\n\nBut within days, Trump backpedaled, postponing tariffs on goods covered by a trade agreement between the U.S. and both countries. Trump also granted a request from automakers to delay tariffs on cars for the same time period.\n\nSheinbaum hit back at the tariffs last week, saying \"nobody wins with this decision.\" Mexico would seek other trading partners, she said.\n\nShe took a victory lap after Trump's delay of the tariffs, declaring that \"dialogue and respect have prevailed.\"\n\nMexicans rally around Sheinbaum\n\n\"Mexican people view her as having done a very good job in handling the situation,\" said John McNeece, senior fellow at the University of California-San Diego Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies.\n\nIn her negotiations with Trump, Sheinbaum has not been as aggressive as Canada, and has \"spoken of cooperation, collaboration, but not subordination. She's done it in a very cool tone,\" he added.\n\nTrump's proposed tariffs of 25% on Mexican goods could \"do great damage to Mexico,\" McNeece added. More than 82% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S., according to government data.\n\n\"For the most part, Mexican people will rally around Sheinbaum, but there will be great concern,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Canada, support for the country's Liberal Party surged late last month, after Trump's tussle with the country. The Liberals wiped out a 26-point Conservative Party lead within six weeks, CBC News reported.\n\nTrump's poll numbers below par\n\nWhile the Mexican president and Canada's ruling party enjoy favorable opinion polls, Trump's popularity at home is in the doldrums.\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup poll, taken in mid-February, Trump's approval rating stands at 45%, a slip of two points from the month before. That's still higher than his first-term approval rating of 41%, but well below the 61% average of U.S. presidents in the first quarter of their term.\n\nThe White House did not comment on whether Trump's tariffs have spurred a swell of nationalism in Canada and Mexico or on the drop in Trump's approval rating.\n\nProvoking Canada\n\nTrump has taken frequent jabs at Canada, and even threatened to annex it.\n\n\"I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state,\" he said during his Super Bowl interview last month. In December, he jabbed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling him \"governor\" of the \"great state of Canada.\"\n\nCanadians are not having it. A Leger poll taken from Feb. 28 to March 2 found 85% of Canadians reject Trump's annexation proposal.\n\nUp north, a 'wave of nationalism'\n\nCarney echoed that sentiment in his victory speech, declaring that Canada \"never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\n\"A wave of nationalism has swept the country that I've never seen before,\" said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.\n\n\"The catalytic external event was Mr. Trump, and the way he has proceeded since taking office on January the 20th with these tariffs on Canada, which Canadians feel are not justified,\" Robertson said.\n\nU.S. goods: 'People aren't buying them'\n\nRobertson said the swell of patriotism is palpable in Canada.\n\n\"This year, for the first time ever, going down streets mid-February... people had put flags in their windows, which is unlike Canadians,\" he said. Canadian grocery stores \"identify where the goods are coming from, and if it comes from the States, people aren't buying them.\"\n\nCarney, who is still a relative unknown in Canada, would be the \"beneficiary\" of that swell of patriotism, Robertson said.\n\nCarney's ascent in Canada − he's set to replace the unpopular Prime Minister Trudeau in the coming days − came as voters rated him more competent to square off against Trump than his political rivals, including Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party.\n\nIn Ontario, conservative Doug Ford won reelection as premier (akin to a U.S. governor) last month on the same question: Who was best equipped to counter Trump's tariffs.\n\nLast month, Poilievre steered the Conservatives into a Trump-inspired rebrand, unveiling the slogan \"Canada First.\"\n\nElon Musk, Trump's multibillionaire lieutenant, appeared to endorse him in January. The Liberal Party, in response, released a video showing the close similarities between Poilievre's statements and those of Trump. (While Carney's Liberals lead in the recent Ipsos poll, a Nanos Research poll released Tuesday showed the Conservatives ahead by one percentage point.)\n\nAn election date hasn't been set. \"Mr. Poilievre has modeled his campaign style on Mr. Trump and the Republicans, highly negative and critical,\" said Robertson. \"Suddenly, when the country gets attacked, the people expect political leadership to rally around.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}]}

Gu was born and raised in San Francisco, though she spends time each year in China and is fluent in Mandarin.\n\n\"It was just sort of a thank you,\" Goldschmidt said. \"They were basically very keen to thank U.S. Ski & Snowboard for how we’ve supported Eileen. Both Eileen and her mother and the Chinese snow sports … federation are very appreciative that we’ve continued to embrace her, allow her to train as appropriate with our team.\"\n\nGoldschmidt said they did not get into specifics of future arrangements, though Gu has trained with the U.S. team in the past and competed in U.S. Ski & Snowboard events.

Bjorninen’s high stick sent him to the penalty box seven minutes into the game, and his team went down 1-0 18 seconds later.\n\nWith the one-skater advantage, Russia forward Mikhail Grigorenko – who also spent time in the NHL – sauntered down to the right circle and put one past Finland goaltender Harri Sateri.\n\nFinland peppered Russia goaltender Ivan Fedotov with 15 first-period shots, but the 25-year-old remained unfazed and kept the Finns off the board.\n\nThat was, until Ville Pokka scored off a shot from the right boards that Fedotov never saw because of Saku Maenalanen’s screen in front of the net. The goal tied the game 3:28 into the second and the score remained knotted at 1 through the period.\n\nRussia won the 2018 gold over Germany in Pyeongchang, a tournament that also did not include NHL players. The 2022 Olympics expected to include NHL players before the league pulled out in January due to COVID-19-related disruptions to the schedule.\n\nFinland had medaled six times in the Olympics with two silvers (1988 Calgary, 2006 Turin) and four bronzes (1994 Lillehammer, 1998 Nagano, 2010 Vancouver, 2014 Sochi).\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nFinland ties up men's hockey gold medal match against ROC\n\nBEIJING — Ville Pokka scored off a shot from the right boards that Russian goaltender Ivan Fedotov never saw because of Saku Maenalanen’s screen in front of the net.

Each country won two races in the final, but Norway won based on the better overall time.\n\nIt was yet another unfulfilling ending for the two-time Olympic champion, who had wanted to do the team event so badly she changed her departure from Beijing after high winds pushed the race back a day.\n\nShiffrin has three medals from her first two Olympic appearances, two golds and a silver, and was expected to contend for several more here. But she only finished two of her individual events, recording Did Not Finishes in the giant slalom, slalom and Alpine combined, her best events.\n\nShe finished ninth in the super-G and was 18th in the downhill.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nAlong with bitter cold temperatures, high winds delay Alpine skiing finale\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – It was so windy, and cold, and hard to see, it was dangerous for action sports stars.\n\nThe weather in the mountain zones of the Beijing Winter Olympics had teeth Saturday.\n\nFor perspective, the Hebei Zhangjiakou Shangyi Wind Farm is up here at the same venue as the freestyle skiing sports, and according to China Daily, it is the richest solar and wind energy resource in north China.\n\nOn Saturday, maybe that number was more impressive.\n\nIt varied, but competition temperatures hovered around minus-9 Fahrenheit, but with the wind it felt like minus-25. Wind gusts varied from 17-30 mph, according to the weather app from Chongli.\n\nAt Yanqing, the start of the Alpine mixed team event was delayed twice in hopes the winds would die down.

If it is the last time I’m in the sled, and if it is my last Olympics run, I wanted to go out the way I wanted to.\"\n\nWhen Meyers Taylor and brakeman Sylvia Hoffman reached the bottom of the track at Yanqing Sliding Center, having put down a flawless run that guaranteed a medal, her reaction said it all. Meyers Taylor threw her fist in the air and hopped out of the sled, gave Hoffman a huge hug and celebrated in front of her supporters with Team USA.\n\nIf this was the 37-year old’s final Olympics, it was one she couldn’t have been prouder of.\n\n\"It’s been a really long Olympics, a really long season, a long four years,\" she said. \"Part of it was just relief to come down and cross the line and have another medal. It was also just being excited.

We've got you covered.)\n\nAmericans won gold and silver in the event, earning Team USA a spot on the podium in the event for the third consecutive Olympics.\n\nAlex Hall shot to the top of the leaderboard with an outstanding first run, and it stood up throughout the competition to earn him the gold.\n\nNick Goepper took home the silver and now owns three medals in the freeski discipline after claiming silver and bronze in the first two Olympic competitions in 2014 and 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. men’s hockey team got knocked out of the Olympics in the quarterfinals with a shootout loss to Slovakia. .\n\nAnd in the men's aerials finals, another American trio – Justin Schoenfeld, Chris Lillis and Eric Loughran – advanced for a chance at gold. Lillis and Schoenefeld teamed with Ashley Caldwell to help the U.S. win gold last week in the Olympic debut of mixed team aerials.\n\nFigure skating has the night off (but NBC re-aired the women's short program in prime time Tuesday night). The women's competition resumes Thursday with the individual free skate.\n\nTV SCHEDULE: What and how to watch Olympics Tuesday night and Wednesday morning\n\nTEXT ALERTS: Sign up for behind-the-scenes access from our reporters on the ground\n\nOLYMPICS NEWSLETTER: All of our coverage straight to your inbox\n\nMEDAL COUNT: How each country is performing at the Winter Games\n\nJustin Schoenefeld, Chris Lillis fail to medal in men's aerials\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — Chris Lillis had been jumping brilliantly in the qualifying round on Tuesday and the first two runs of the finals on Wednesday night of the men’s aerials.\n\nBut when it came down to his final jump, he didn’t quite execute as well.\n\nInstead, China’s Qi Guangpu ripped off a precise, clean and fast back double full-full-double full (a back single layout flip with two twists, a flip with a full twist and then a single layout flip with two twists) on his final jump with a degree of difficulty of 5.0 to earn a winning score of 129.00.\n\nUkraine’s Oleksandr Abramenko took silver and Russia’s Ilia Burov took bronze.\n\nJustin Schoenefeld was fourth and Lillis was fifth, both for Team USA.\n\n\"You know, aerial skiers, we like it coming down to one jump and one winner take all, just like you saw with Qi Guangpu today,\" said Lillis. \"I got to give a shout out to him for an excellent performance. I've watched him my entire career and to see him get on the top of the podium in what might be as last season, I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nLillis had been in the third position after his first jump of back full-double full-full went so well.\n\nBut when he changed up to a back double full-full-double full for the super final he landed a bit off.\n\n\"I'm not exactly positive what speed I went through it but obviously I had a little bit too much on the flip rotation,\" said Lillis. \"Just kind of devastated not to end up on the top of the podium because I know I have that caliber of jumping in me and I've been doing that up until this point.\"\n\nSchoenefeld and Lillis had helped the U.S. mixed aerials team win gold over the favored Chinese with Ashley Caldwell.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nJohannes Klaebo of Norway won his fourth Olympic medal at Beijing\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — The clinical speed of Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo in the final stages of the men’s team sprint classic ensured Norway claimed another cross-country skiing gold medal at Beijing, ahead of Finland and ROC.\n\nIivo Niskanen (Finland) had already won gold in the 15km classic and claimed bronze in the 15km+15km skiathlon, and he handed teammate Joni Maki a small lead going into the last lap of Wednesday's final.\n\nBut Klaebo waited patiently for his moment before pressing the accelerator as the skiers entered the stadium for the final time and pulling away to take gold.\n\nIt is his fourth medal at these Games, having earlier collected gold in the individual sprint, silver in the 4x10km relay and bronze in the 15km classic.\n\nIn the women’s team sprint, there was a surprise victory for the German team of Victoria Carl and Katharina Hennig, who claimed gold ahead of Sweden and ROC.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nNo medals for Team USA in short-track speedskating\n\nBEIJING — Team USA will leave the 2022 Winter Olympics without a medal in short-track speedskating.\n\nOn the final night of competition Wednesday, the three American women in the 1500-meter field all failed to qualify for the final.\n\nKristen Santos, who narrowly missed out on a medal in the 1000 late last week, came closest to advancing. She was in the mix toward the end of her semifinal heat before colliding with Sumire Kikuchi of Japan, sending Santos off-course and Kikuchi into the pads. Because a third skater was deemed to have caused the crash, both were advanced to the \"B\" final to decide 8th through 14th place.\n\nCorinne Stoddard and Julie Letai also made the semifinals but finished fifth and eighth in their heats, respectively.\n\nTeam USA won six medals in short-track speedskating at the 2010 Olympics but only one in each of the past two Games.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nThe U.S. dominated in freeski slopestyle, but suffered a devastating defeat on the ice. Here's what else you missed overnight while you were sleeping:\n\nFor the third consecutive Winter Olympics, the U.S. men's hockey team will not reach the podium. Team USA was defeated by Slovakia after a shootout in the quarterfinals. The defeat came in stunning fashion, as Slovakia scored the equalizer with under a minute left in regulation.\n\nAlex Hall and Nick Goepper won the gold and silver medals, respectively, in the men's freeski slopestyle competition. Since freeski slopestyle was added to the Olympic program in 2014, the Americans have medaled every Games and now have six of the nine medals awarded.\n\nRussian speedskater Daniil Aldoshkin apologized after he flashed his middle fingers Tuesday following a win against the United States in the men's team pursuit semifinals.\n\nJessie Diggins, Rosie Brennan fall short of cross country skiing medal\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — Rosie Brennan looked steady and in control on her three laps in the team sprint, staying within the middle of the pack in the first two cases and surging on the third.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie Diggins shot of out a cannon on the exchanges, grabbing the lead – or taking her place among the leaders and holding on.\n\nBrennan’s splits were impressive, with her third and final lap her fastest at 3 minutes, 38.7 seconds.\n\nDiggins used that energy to catapult from Brennan’s final tag and jumped out to the lead right away. But she faded in the final stretch, first on the major descent and then in the all-out straightaway to the finish line. Diggins' final lap was 31 seconds slower than her first.\n\nMeanwhile the leaders all had a powerful final kick with Germany taking gold, Sweden taking silver and Russia taking bronze.\n\nBrennan and Diggins finished fifth for the U.S.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nUS women cross country skiers advance to final\n\nRosie Brennan and Jessie Diggins advanced to the final in the women’s team sprint Wednesday.\n\nThe Americans were second in their semifinal, finishing 4.1 seconds behind Germany. The race is six laps around a course of 1.5 kilometers skiing classic style.\n\nIn 2018 Diggins won gold in the team sprint with teammate Kikkan Randall, the first ever gold at the Olympics by Americans in cross country skiing.\n\nEight days ago at these Games, she made U.S. cross country history again by winning the first individual medal by an American woman, bronze in the freestyle sprint.\n\nThe women’s final in the team sprint will be held at 5:15 p.m. Beijing time (4:15 a.m. ET).\n\nGold medalist skier Alex Hall happy with decision to compete for Team USA\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — With an Olympic gold medal, Alex Hall extended the USA’s success in the Olympic slopestyle competition.\n\nBut Hall didn’t have to compete for the United States.\n\nHall, 23, was born in Alaska but raised mostly in Zurich, Switzerland, where his parents are professors. His mother, Elena Conti, is an Italian citizen. His father, Marcus Hall, is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThat gives Hall, who is fluent in German, both Italian and U.S. passports.\n\nThough he did talk with the Italian coaches about potentially competing for them, Hall opted to join the U.S. freeskiing team and moved to Park City, Utah, when he was around 16.\n\n“I think I pretty quickly realized that I wanted to ski for the U.S.,” he said. “That’s where I live nowadays, so it feels right to do for the U.S.”\n\nThough his parents still live in Switzerland, Hall has grandparents nearby in Salt Lake City. Having friends and family in the States helped him feel like it was the right decision.\n\n“The group of friends I get to hang out with on a daily basis on the team is really special,” he said. “I wouldn’t change it for a thing and I’m glad I stuck to the U.S. and have been competing for them ever since.”\n\nIt’s worked out well for the U.S. team, as well.\n\nHall entered these Games primed for a medal, having won big air and taking bronze in slopestyle at the X Games last month. Hall also took bronze in slopestyle at the world championship last year.\n\nHis Olympic gold here on Wednesday added to the country’s success in this event, where it has won six of the nine medals awarded since freeski slopestyle became part of the Olympic program in 2014.\n\nHall is the second American gold medalist in the event after Joss Christensen won in 2014 as part of a U.S. sweep.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nUS men's hockey team eliminated from Olympic tournament with shootout loss to Slovakia\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. men’s hockey team was less than a minute from making the medal round. Instead, the U.S. will have nothing to show for what was an impressive showing at the Beijing Olympics – until disaster struck in the quarterfinals against Slovakia on Wednesday.\n\nWith the goalie pulled and a one-man advantage, Marek Hrivik tied the game for Slovakia with 43.7 seconds left in regulation. In the 10-minute, sudden-death 3-on-3 overtime, neither team scored. The drought continued in the shootout until Peter Cehlarik scored on the fourth attempt. The U.S. failed to score on all five penalty shot attempts and are going home after a 3-2 defeat.\n\nSam Hentges provided a go-ahead score for the U.S. with 11:04 to go in the second period after Nathan Smith skated through the neutral zone, which the U.S. largely controlled all game, and dished the puck to Nick Perbix. Perbix found Hentges right in front of Slovakian goaltender Patrik Rybar, and the St. Cloud Sate forward easily found the back of the net for the 2-1 U.S. lead.\n\nThe score remained that way for the final 31 minutes, even though Matty Beniers (one assist) nearly added an insurance goal by hitting the post inside of 12 minutes, and the U.S. couldn't score during 1:23 of a 5-on-3 advantage before that.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSA takes 2-1 lead on Slovakia in men's hockey quarterfinal\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. men’s hockey team is 20 minutes away from being guaranteed the chance to play for a medal.\n\nTied 1-1 with Slovakia in their quarterfinal matchup, the Americans began flying around in the offensive zone in the second period and were rewarded with the lead.\n\nThe USA's fourth line broke through with 11:04 to go in the period when Nathan Smith skated through the neutral zone and dished the puck to Nick Perbix, who fed Sam Hentges right in front of Slovakian foaltender Patrik Rybar. The St. Cloud State forward easily found the twine, and the U.S. took a 2-1 lead.\n\nOn the defensive end, the U.S. continued sacrificing their bodies and blocking shots to keep life somewhat easy for goaltender Strauss Mann. He has 14 saves.\n\nSlovakia is outshooting the U.S. 21-15.\n\nThe U.S. will open the third period with one minute left on a power play, their first of the game.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nLate goal pulls US even with Slovakia at first intermission in men's hockey\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. knew Slovakia's Juraj Slafkovsky could present problems against them, even if he’s just 17 years old.\n\nBut the defense forgot about him during a critical possession in the defensive zone. The USA couldn’t clear a puck along the boards, and the mistake cost them. Peter Ceresnak found a wide-open Slafkovsky in the slot. His wrister past the glove of U.S. goaltender Strauss Mann made it 1-0 with 8:15 to go in the first period. Slafkovsky now leads the tournament in goals (five).\n\nIn net, Mann’s rebound control has left much to be desired. That could come back to bite the Americans, who are in a position they cannot afford such circumstances.\n\nBut as they’ve done all tournament, the U.S. answered. The transition game has been strong against Slovakia, and Kenny Agostino streaked up the ice with less than a minute left. The puck wound up on Matty Beniers’ stick, and he dished to Nick Abruzzese, whose nice move in front of Patrik Rybar tied it at 1.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nAlex Hall, Nick Goepper give USA gold, silver in slopestyle\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Americans are on the Olympics freeski slopestyle podium again.\n\nTwo-time Olympian Alex Hall won his first medal, using a unique run with difficulty and style to land at the top of the podium. Teammate Nick Goepper took silver, his third Olympic medal, and Sweden's Jesper Tjader won bronze.\n\nHall jumped out to a big lead after his first run, using long rail slides and unique jumps to take the lead. On the first jump, whose winged takeoffs make tricks more difficult, Hall landed a double cork 1620, flipping 4 ½ times while doing two off-axis flips.\n\nGoepper put down a big second run to claim his third Olympic medal. He took a unique line by using the rail atop the guard shack on the course and then landed back-to-back double cork 1440s on the final two jumps to get in podium position.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. women on the ropes with curling loss to Canada\n\nThe U.S. women’s curling team will head into its final round-robin match 4-4 and very much hanging to its medal round hopes by a thread.\n\nThe U.S. lost to Canada on Wednesday, 7-6, after Canada skipper Jennifer Jones converted a wide-open draw for the winning point. In a sense, the Americans were fortunate to even be in that position after Jones shockingly whiffed on a shot in the ninth end that would have pretty much ended the game, allowing the Americans to steal one and tie it up.\n\nBut with the hammer in the 10th, the Canadians committed to just knocking away every guard the Americans tried to put up. Tabitha Peterson, the U.S. skipper, couldn’t place her final stone in a position to put any pressure on Jones, who needed to only put something in the vicinity of the button to win.\n\nIt was one of a few moments where the Americans’ strategy seemed questionable.\n\nDown 5-3, the U.S. team got into a bit of a bind in the seventh end when Canada put three in the house, including one on the button, necessitating an extremely skillful shot from Peterson to squeeze out a point with the hammer. Instead, the best Peterson could do was knock two out, allowing Canada to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nCanada cracked the door open for the U.S. to get all three back in the eighth end with a double takeout, but Peterson elected for the safer play to score two points, hoping for another opportunity in one of the final two ends. Though the Americans did tie it up, they never got the hammer back, which proved to be decisive.\n\nThe U.S. will play its final round-robin game on Wednesday night (morning in the U.S.) against Japan and will certainly need a victory to be in contention for entry into the medal round for the first time since 2002. Even then, they will likely need some help depending on how the final round-robin games and tiebreakers shake out.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nTeam USA looks to continue surprising run in men's hockey\n\nBEIJING — Through three games, the U.S. men’s hockey team has used a combination of speed, youth and toughness to claim the No. 1 seed entering the quarterfinals and emerge as the surprise story of the tournament.\n\nOf course, that means nothing anymore. A few bad bounces, and it could mark the end of the line for the Americans in Beijing.\n\nStrauss Mann, who picked up the win in a 4-2 victory against Canada in group play, will start in net against Slovakia.\n\nSlovakia is led by Juraj Slafkovsky, a potential top 10 NHL draft pick this summer. The 17-year-old is tied for the tournament lead in goals (four).\n\nThe U.S. will have to stop him without one of its top defenders. Jake Sanderson (undisclosed injury, day-to-day) isn’t dressed for the second consecutive day.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nKaren Chen performs to 'Requiem' at 2022 Olympics\n\nBEIJING — Skating first in the final group, American Karen Chen fell on a planned triple loop jump in the second half of her program, grimacing with frustration as she left the ice.\n\n“I didn’t skate the way I wanted to skate and definitely not what I am capable of,” Chen said. “I need to just think about what went wrong and then move on into the long program.”\n\nPerforming to \"Requiem for a Dream” and “Requiem for a Tower,” Chen's score of 64.11 on Tuesday was slightly lower than her short program score in the team event earlier this month, which was 65.20. She also fell in that program.\n\nChen, 22, went on to skate a redemptive long program as Team USA won silver in the team event.\n\nThe only returning Olympian of the three American women in the field, Chen placed 10th at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. She's currently in 13th place entering Thursday's free skate in Beijing.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nAlysa Liu skates to music from Don Quixote at Beijing Games\n\nBEIJING — Alysa Liu barely stopped smiling Tuesday, from the moment she took the ice for her Olympic debut to the moment she left.\n\nSkating to “Gypsy Dance II” from Don Quixote, Liu didn't attempt the notoriously difficult triple axel, which has helped distinguish her from her compatriots, but she turned in a clean, energetic performance in her short program, recording a score of 69.50 and moving into second place at the time.\n\n“I am happy with what I did,” Liu said. “All of my training has been to get to the Olympics, and my dream has come true.”\n\nHer father, Arthur Liu, was one of the more vocal critics of the recent decision to allow Russian teenager Kamila Valieva to compete despite a positive drug test in December.\n\n\"She tested positive for a banned drug. What’s not clear about it? She should be out,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \"That is as simple as that. What kind of message are they sending to millions of young boys and girls in sports — particularly figure skaters? That cheaters are allowed to compete in the Olympics, the holiest competition on the planet. It totally destroys the Olympic spirit.\"\n\nLiu, 16, is not only the youngest member of the U.S. figure skating team, but also the youngest member of Team USA in Beijing, period. A two-time national champion, she was favored to win a third title in January but tested positive for COVID-19 in between the short program and long program, forcing her to withdraw.\n\nShe'll begin Thursday's free skate in eighth place.\n\n— Tom Schad and Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmericans Alex Hall, Nick Goepper in solid medal position in men's slopestyle\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – The U.S. men have a good chance to keep their medal streak alive in freeski slopestyle.\n\nAmericans Alex Hall and Nick Goepper lead the way with the best scores in the field entering the third and final run. Colby Stevenson, Team USA's third entrant, is sixth.\n\nSince the event was added to the Games in 2014, at least one American has medaled in each edition. In Tuesday’s qualifying at the Beijing Olympics, the U.S. trio all qualified in the top six for the final.\n\n“I still got a little bit left in the tank,” Goepper said after qualifying. “I’m more relaxed than I was eight years ago. I just think that comes with experience and age.”\n\nGoepper helped the USA start its streak, earning bronze in Sochi as part of a USA sweep in the event’s debut. Joss Christensen won gold in that competition, while Gus Kenworthy took silver.\n\nGoepper, 27, also won a silver medal in Pyeongchang four years ago.\n\nIn addition to the field – Switzerland’s Andri Ragletti is the top-ranked skier in the world this year and qualified in first – Goepper will contend with his teammates for the podium.\n\nHall, a two-time Olympian, entered these Games fresh of a gold medal in big air and a bronze in slopestyle at X Games last month.\n\nStevenson, meanwhile, has an Olympic silver medal in big air from that event’s debut last week.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nMariah Bell skates to music by Yiruma at Winter Olympics\n\nBEIJING — Mariah Bell became the oldest American woman in 94 years to compete in Olympic figure skating on Tuesday night, when she took the ice for her short program.\n\nMaking her Olympic debut, Mariah Bell, 25, performed her short program to “River Flowers in You” by Yiruma. However she fell on the second part of her triple flip-triple toeloop combination at the beginning of her program but landed her next two jumps to record a score of 65.38, which was good for second place at the time.\n\n“I have very mixed emotions about it,” Bell said. “I am bummed with the mistake on the opening element, but I am happy how I came back with everything else. Ultimately, I just really enjoyed skating on Olympic ice.\"\n\nBell, who won the most recent U.S. national championship, was the first of three American women to take the ice Tuesday. She ended up in 11th place heading into Thursday's free skate.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nOPINION: As Valieva takes the ice, American Mariah Bell upstages her where it matters\n\nHow do figure skaters choose the music for their programs?\n\nBEIJING — For casual viewers, it can be what stands out.\n\nFor Olympic figure skaters, it can help pave the way to a medal.\n\nThe music behind a figure skating program plays critical roles on multiple fronts – setting the tone of a performance, shaping the choreography and, in some cases, even helping fuel the emotion of the skaters on the ice. It can be one song, or several stitched together. Something iconic, or relatively unknown.\n\n\"There's a lot,\" American pairs skater Brandon Frazier said, when asked about the process of selecting the music for a program. \"We try to find music we relate to. That's number one. We rely heavily on our choreographer's opinion, on what they see us doing. ... But all in all, when we're skating to it, we have to feel it.\"\n\nThere's also the obvious: When you pick a song for a program, you're signing up to skate to it almost every day, for months at a time.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nWhat is trimetazidine, the heart drug at the center of Russia's doping scandal?\n\nRussian star figure skater Kamila Valieva was temporarily suspended after she tested positive for trimetazidine a month before she won the team event gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut what kind of drug is trimetazidine? TMZ is a drug used to treat angina and other heart-related conditions. It works by increasing blood flow to the heart and limiting rapid swings in blood pressure. The drug is not approved for use in the United States.\n\nSince 2014, it has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances and is categorized as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator.\" This is illegal for athletes to use both in and out of competition as it can increase blood flow efficiency and improve endurance.\n\nHer lawyer argued Valieva had accidentally taken TMZ since her grandfather uses it for his heart issues.\n\n— Gabriela Miranda\n\nTwo-time Olympic medalist living off Team USA's 'camping meals'\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — At least Nick Goepper can look forward to going back to the hotel to a nice warm home cooked ... camp-style meal.\n\nOpen lid, add hot water, stir. Every day. Sometimes a few times a day.\n\nAfter qualifying slopestyle finals with a strong run that started on the big house at the top of the slopestyle course and then ended with his final jumps – a switch double misty 1260 into a double cork 1080 on the quarter pipe jump into a double cork 1440 on the last jump – Goepper was feeling it.\n\nGoepper, a two-time Olympic medalist, was the top American in Tuesday's freeski slopestyle qualifying, in third, and advanced along with teammates Alex Hall and Colby Stevenson. The final is Wednesday.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nUS-born Chinese figure skater admits online criticism 'did hurt me a little bit'\n\nBEIJING — There is a California-born teenager competing for host China at the 2022 Winter Olympics receiving online hate, and it's not free skier Eileen Gu.\n\nQuite contrary to the adulation that Gu has received for embracing China, women's figure skater Zhu Yi faced harsh online criticism in China after she fell during the women's short program in the team event early in the Olympics.\n\nZhu, who moved to China last year after living the first 18 years of her life in southern California, crashed into the wall and finished last.\n\n“In the beginning, (the comments) did hurt me a little bit,\" Zhu said Tuesday. \"Of course, I was able to just see it from a different light. And just use it to my own advantage.”\n\nThe performance dropped China from third to fifth. According to CNN, the hashtag \"Zhu Yi Has Fallen\" reached 200 million views on the social media website Weibo. Zhu, whose American name is Beverly, also had been criticized online for not speaking fluent Chinese.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zhu ended the individual short program ranked 27th out of 30, meaning she didn't qualify for Thursday's free skate.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA medal count up to 17\n\nHeading into Wednesday's action in Beijing, the United States is tied with Canada for fourth in overall medals with 17, after adding a bronze in the men's speedskating team pursuit.\n\nVeteran Joey Mantia paced Team USA as it outlasted the Netherlands in the bronze medal race, giving the 36-year-old Ocala, Florida, native the first medal of his career in his third Olympics.\n\nNorway leads the total medal count with 26, including 12 gold. Germany is in second with nine gold medals, while the Russian Olympic Committee (20 total medals) and Germany (18) are just ahead of the U.S. and Canada overall.\n\nRussia's Kamila Valieva returns to the ice\n\nRussian phenom Kamila Valieva took the ice Tuesday amid international controversy after testing positive for a banned heart medication called trimetazidine. She was provisionally suspended, then reinstated upon appeal, allowing her to compete despite differing opinions between the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nValieva, 15, twisted off-axis on the first of her three jumps – the notorious triple axel – and touched the ice on her descent. But she landed the other two jumps, scoring 82.16.\n\nShe leads the women's competition heading into Thursday's free skate. The highest-ranked American in the field, Alysa Liu, is in eighth place.\n\nOPINION: As Valieva takes the ice, American Mariah Bell upstages her where it matters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/14/winter-olympics-2022-tuesday-live-updates-beijing/6785946001/", "title": "Olympics recap: Kamila Valieva returns, Alysa Liu tops for USA ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nAlysa Liu, the youngest member of the U.S. figure skating team and youngest member of Team USA in Beijing finished eighth overall Tuesday recording a score of 69.50 in women's figure skating – the highest score among American women. Mariah Bell finished 11th while Karen Chen placed 13th.\n\nRussian figure skater Kamila Valieva was cleared to compete in the short program after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. After a banned heart medication was flagged in a test Valieva took two months ago, the CAS ruled that the 15-year-old Valieva, is a “protected athlete” because of her age, allowing her to compete.\n\n(Looking for updates from Wednesday's events? We've got you covered.)\n\nSkiing in her first-ever Olympic downhill, Mikaela Shiffrin completed her run well off the pace in the event at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nShiffrin posted a time of 1:34.36, over two seconds off the gold medal run by Switzerland's Corinne Suter.

She also fell in that program.\n\nChen, 22, went on to skate a redemptive long program as Team USA won silver in the team event.\n\nThe only returning Olympian of the three American women in the field, Chen placed 10th at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nAlysa Liu short program score\n\nBEIJING — Alysa Liu barely stopped smiling Tuesday, from the moment she took the ice for her Olympic debut to the moment she left.\n\nThough she didn't attempt the notoriously difficult triple axel, which has helped distinguish her from her compatriots, Liu turned in a clean, energetic performance in her short program, recording a score of 69.50.\n\nWith only eight skaters left to compete, the California native was sitting in second place behind only Wakaba Higuchi of Japan.\n\nLiu, 16, is not only the youngest member of the U.S. figure skating team, but also the youngest member of Team USA in Beijing, period. A two-time national champion, she was favored to win a third title in January but tested positive for COVID-19 in between the short program and long program, forcing her to withdraw.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nValieva has Moscow fans cheering her\n\nFifteen-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva has seen the support of her country despite being the center of a doping controversy.\n\nBillboards in Moscow have popped up with the message, “Kamila, we are with you!\"\n\n“It is very nice, in such a difficult time, this support is very important to me,” Valieva said, according to a report in the Russian newspaper Pravda. “I thought I would be alone, but my close people will never leave me.”\n\nMariah Bell short program score\n\nBEIJING — Mariah Bell became the oldest American woman in 94 years to compete in Olympic figure skating on Tuesday night, when she took the ice for her short program.\n\nBell, 25, fell on the second part of her triple flip-triple toeloop combination at the beginning of her program but landed her next two jumps to record a score of 65.38, which was good for second place at the time.\n\nBell, who won the most recent national championships, was the first of three American women to take the ice Tuesday. Alysa Liu was set to skate at 8:18 a.m. ET, followed by Karen Chen at 8:46 a.m. ET.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nUS men qualify for aerials final\n\nThe U.S. qualified all three men for the aerials finals on Wednesday.\n\nChris Lillis of Pittsford, N.Y. and Eric Loughran, of Pelham, N.H. both qualified on their first jumps while Justin Schoenefeld of Lawrenceburg, Ind. got through on his second jump.\n\nLoughran was in fourth position after a Back Full-Double Full-Full while Lillis sat in sixth position with a Back Double Full-Full-Full.\n\nSchoenefeld used a higher degree of difficulty Back Double Full-Full-Full on his second jump to get himself in to the medal round.\n\nFour days ago Schoenefeld and Lillis helped the U.S. mixed aerials team win gold for the over the favored Chinese with Ashley Caldwell. Schoenefeld was the first athlete from the state of Indiana to win a gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games.\n\n-- Lori Nickel\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nThe U.S. picked up one medal overnight, a bronze in men's team pursuit. Here's what else you missed overnight Tuesday while you were sleeping:\n\nSofia Goggia of Italy wins silver just 23 days after scary crash\n\nBEIJING — After the last three weeks, hurtling down the mountain was the easy part for Sofia Goggia.\n\nThe Italian won the silver medal in the downhill Tuesday, just 23 days after a crash in the super-G race in Cortina left her with a partially torn cruciate ligament in her left knee and a “minor fracture” in her fibula. She didn’t get back on skis until Feb. 4.\n\n“This is why I have so much effort, because I wanted an outcome like this one today,” Goggia said. “Of course sometimes things don't work as you want to, but I really gave everything I could. … This is why I'm really grateful and glad for this medal.\n\n\"I couldn't have done more than this today.\"\n\nGoggia won the downhill gold at the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018, and was heavily favored before her crash to repeat. She had won all but one of her last nine races, and leads the World Cup standings.\n\nBut the crash left Goggia uncertain if she’d even be able to compete at the Beijing Olympics. She rehabbed relentlessly, ditching her crutches three days after the crash so she wouldn’t lose her fitness, and working in the gym and the pool.\n\nShe arrived in Beijing on Feb. 7. She hoped to do the super-G, but decided after training runs that she wasn’t ready. After the first downhill training run, Goggia said she wasn’t concerned with the result, that just doing the race would be a victory.\n\n“I just said to myself, `I'm here, let's play, let's do everything,’\" she said.\n\nGoggia was in first place when she crossed the finish line. She let out a loud and long scream, then kissed a TV camera. Switzerland’s Corinne Suter, who is second in the downhill standings, bumped her to second, but it couldn’t dampen Goggia’s happiness.\n\nGoggia’s Italy teammate Nadia Delago won the bronze medal.\n\n“It’s still a medal. It’s still a great medal,” Goggia said. “It’s an unbelievable medal because of the condition of the last 20 days.”\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nUS men win bronze medal in team pursuit\n\nIt was no world record for the United States in the men’s speedskating team pursuit, something the Americans accomplished at the world championships in Salt Lake City two months ago.\n\nA bronze medal in Beijing will do, though.\n\nJoey Mantia, 36, paced the team against speedskating legend Sven Kramer (nine Olympic medals, four gold) over the eight laps as the Americans outlasted the Netherlands with a time of 3:38.81. Meanwhile, the Dutch switched leaders on and off throughout the race. For Mantia, a native of Ocala, Florida, it’s the first medal of his career in his third Olympics.\n\nCanada defeated Russia in the A final to win gold.\n\nIn the B final, Mantia replaced Ethan Cepuran, who skated for the U.S. in the semifinal. The decision to not include Mantia in both heats was perplexing to some in the speedskating community, who felt not rolling with him against Russia in the semifinals was a case of the Americans failing to deploy their best lineup. Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman competed in both heats to earn the first medals of their careers as well.\n\nDawson arrived in Beijing later than planned due to a COVID infection weeks before the Olympics. He landed within two days of his first race, except his skates didn’t make it, forcing the 21-year-old to race the 1,500 meters on a borrowed pair. Dawson finished second-to-last (28th), while Mantia came in sixth in the individual event.\n\nIt’s the second U.S. speedskating medal at the Games; Erin Jackson made history by becoming the first Black woman to win an individual gold in the Winter Olympics, winning the women’s 500 meters on Sunday.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nKamila Valieva takes the ice for her short program later Tuesday\n\nBEIJING — The most-anticipated figure skating short program since the 1994 Tonya-Nancy scandal begins Tuesday at 6 p.m. Beijing time (5 a.m. ET).\n\nBut the show really starts at 9:52 p.m. local time (8:52 a.m. ET). That’s when 15-year-old Russian gold-medal favorite Kamila Valieva takes the ice for her two-minute, 40-second short program.\n\nShe was expected to dominate the competition, but that was before she became perhaps the most infamous athlete on earth due to a positive drug test that has rocked these Games.\n\nNow the question is: how will Valieva deal with the immense pressure she is under? She shared an emotional moment with her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, after practice Saturday.\n\nWill she steel herself against the onslaught of worldwide athletic condemnation and perform as she did in the team event, when she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in an Olympic figure skating competition?\n\nOr will the pressure get to her? Will she make mistakes or even worse, crumble under the intense glare of the spotlight?\n\nAmerican Karen Chen, who won the silver medal with the U.S. team earlier in these Games, skates right before Valieva in the final group. Mariah Bell is three groups earlier and Alysa Liu is in the second-to-last group.\n\nOne thing is certain: whatever happens, viewership of Valieva’s short program will pale in comparison to the number of people who watched Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan skate their short programs in February 1994. TV ratings for that night of the Olympics on CBS soared to 48.5, meaning almost half the nation watched an event that was tape-delayed, in which everyone already knew the result.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nDisastrous ninth end dooms U.S. women's curling team in round robin loss to Switzerland\n\nBEIJING – The U.S. women’s curling team was on the verge of taking down the unbeaten Swiss team Tuesday and putting itself in prime position to make the medal round.\n\nInstead, after a disastrous ninth end that led to a 9-6 loss to Switzerland, the Americans slipped to 4-3 and will be in a five-way fight for the last two spots as the round robin portion of the competition winds down. They will finish out with head-to-head games against two of those teams in Canada and Japan, which also have three losses.\n\nThe Swiss team has not lost yet at these Olympics, but the U.S. put them under a ton of pressure after scoring two points in the eighth end for a 6-4 lead. Unfortunately for the Americans, they made a mess of the ninth end after the Swiss set up the board with two stones in the house and multiple guards.\n\nBoth vice-skip Nina Roth and skipper Tabitha Peterson had takeout opportunities that would have limited the damage to one or two points, but they just missed their targets, opening the door for Switzerland to put together a big end. Swiss skipper Alina Paetz was easily able to knock the only American stone out of the house with the hammer, instantly flipping a two-point deficit into a two-point lead.\n\nThe U.S. has made the medal round just once since curling was re-instated as an Olympic sport in 1998, losing in the semifinals of the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nAlex Hall goes for a 'scary' option in men's freeski slopestyle and it pays off\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Alex Hall likes to keep an open mind as one of the best freeskiers in the world.\n\nSo when he got to Genting Snow Park in the snowy mountains of the Beijing Winter Olympics, he wanted to try every rail, go on every jump and angle and look at every possibility of the slopestyle course first before deciding on his run.\n\nOn Tuesday, for his first and second qualification runs, Hall then unveiled a new creative angle: he took the middle of the slope on the second jump feature, which he didn’t see from any other skier - or snowboarder for that matter. He looked like he was a skipping stone thrown over water, grazing the slope with two aerial moves on both sides. It was graceful and a move he’s been trying for a couple of days and finally dialed in.\n\n“It’s been really scary to figure out but I am a little more confident on it now,” said Hall. “Still a little scared of it but I figured I’d go for it and hope that it worked out – and it did.”\n\nIn more technical terms, it’s a switch left seven to nose butter, to switch left 5 with a Japan grab. And it helped him earn him a qualifying score for the finals on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m always looking for something creative, something that will bring me joy,” said Hall, who advanced with U.S. teammates Nick Goepper and Colby Stevenson. “If I can do that in competition skiing and a big stage like this, at the Olympics, that’s kind of the cherry on top.\"\n\n“It’s a really free sport, you can express yourself exactly how you want. That’s also my personality; that stuff doesn’t really work out for me when I’m too regimented and too serious about everything.”\n\n– Lori Nickel\n\nChina's Su Yiming wins gold, Team USA misses podium in men's snowboard big air\n\nBEIJING – Su Yiming is well-known throughout China as a child actor, but he’s never put on a better performance than in Tuesday’s snowboard big air finals.\n\nJust 17 years old, Su landed both frontside and backside 1800s – the latter with a triple cork, or three vertical flips – to easily win the gold medal in front of the home crowd.\n\nNorway’s Mons Roisland took the silver medal, while Canada’s Max Parrot snagged the bronze with two good runs after crashing on his first attempt.\n\nAfter the first run, it looked like American Chris Corning might have a shot at a medal when he landed a massive backside quad cork 1800, earning him a score of 92. Corning said he had been struggling in practice with his mental focus and was surprised to be able to land that trick.\n\n“I was like 0-for-3 in X-Games (with that trick) so I was super happy about that,” Corning said. “I put it down about as perfect as I can.”\n\nBut after failing to land a frontside 1440 on his second jump, he tried again on his third. Though Corning executed it well, it didn’t have nearly a high enough degree of difficulty to get on the podium given the level of competition. He ended up in seventh place.\n\nFor American Red Gerard, the slopestyle gold medalist in 2018, big air has never been his favorite event. With some help from his competitors, he was in position to potentially medal after landing a solid triple cork backside 1620 with his third jump. But Gerard didn’t get quite enough help and ended up fifth.\n\n“I was very happy I was able to land two runs,” Gerard said. “Just to be in this final was something crazy, definitely a big day for snowboarding with how many spins that were going on. I just didn’t know what to fully do trick-wise, whether to keep it chill or try to push it and go for a way bigger trick. I ended up keeping it chill and I’m quite happy with it honestly. I don’t know if I was fully ready to go 18 and 19 right now.”\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nKamila Valieva says grandfather's medication to blame for positive drug test\n\nBEIJING — Attorneys for Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva argued that the banned substance trimetazidine entered her system through a medication that her grandfather takes, a member of the International Olympic Committee confirmed Tuesday.\n\nIn a scrum with reporters after the IOC's daily press briefing, a reporter asked IOC member Denis Oswald if the IOC was aware of the explanation that Valieva, 15, offered to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in an appeal hearing earlier this month.\n\n\"I was not in this hearing,\" Oswald said. \"Her argument was this contamination which happened with a product her grandfather was taking.\"\n\nThe crux of Valieva's defense had been previously reported Monday by The Dossier Center, a website run by exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The website said it obtained audio of Valieva's hearing with RUSADA, which it said lasted only 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to The Dossier Center, Valieva's attorney, Anna Kozmenko, argued in the hearing that trimetazidine entered the 15-year-old's body accidentally, through a contaminated product. She also argued in the hearing that the product likely belonged to Valieva's grandfather, who takes trimetazidine for heart issues, according to the website.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nMaggie Voisin remembers late brother following women's slopestyle skiing competition\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Maggie Voisin couldn’t feel her brother’s dogtag move as she slid, flipped and spun her way down the Olympic slopestyle course.\n\nThough it was tucked under many layers as Voisin competed in her third Games, the 23-year-old knew it was there both to remind her of the brother she lost just more than a year ago and of the lessons she’s learned since.\n\nSo the veteran freeskier knew to be grateful even as she finished just outside the podium for a second Olympics. The only American in the final at Genting Snow Park on Tuesday, Voisin finished in fifth.\n\n“That really changes the way you look at life. The fact that I am here at the Olympics getting to do what I love, you’ve got to be grateful and appreciative every day,” she said. “That’s how my brother lived his life.”\n\nMichael Voisin, a second lieutenant in the Army, died by suicide in January 2021. His death devastated Maggie Voisin, sending her into a grieving process that prompted her to take time away from training.\n\nTo come back in the Olympics – to briefly sit in bronze medal position – was something to be grateful for.\n\n“I thought about him every moment, every run,” she said, “and I know that I made him proud.”\n\nSwitzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, the silver medalist four years ago, won gold, narrowly beating out China’s Eileen Gu for silver. Estonia’s Kelly Sildaru won bronze on her safety run, seeing her ski pop off at the end of her second run that likely would have scored higher.\n\nVoisin was in bronze-medal position after her second run only to get bumped by Gu and Russia’s Anastasia Tatalina.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nFather of US figure skater Alysa Liu says Kamila Valieva decision 'destroys the Olympic spirit'\n\nBEIJING — The father of United States women's figure skating Olympian Alysa Liu is not happy with the decision that allowed Kamila Valieva to continue competing at the Beijing Olympics despite testing positive for a banned substance Dec. 25.\n\n\"She tested positive for a banned drug. What’s not clear about it? She should be out,\" Arthur Liu said, according to the Associated Press. \"That is as simple as that. What kind of message are they sending to millions of young boys and girls in sports — particularly figure skaters? That cheaters are allowed to compete in the Olympics, the holiest competition on the planet. It totally destroys the Olympic spirit.\"\n\nThe figure skating world, and Olympic movement at large, has been ablaze with criticism after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) determined that Valieva could keep competing at these Games.\n\nArthur Liu said he's avoided giving his daughter medicine while sick to avoid a positive test, and was critical of Valieva's controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze. He also expressed regret of having his daughter compete in figure skating.\n\n\"I just simply can't believe the 'irreparable harm' to her,\" he told reporter Kalyn Kahler. \"How about the irreparable harm to other clean athletes? You are depriving them.\"\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHilary Knight's skills, leadership pushing Team USA forward in women's hockey\n\nOn a team filled with stars, U.S. women's hockey forward Hilary Knight is probably the most popular.\n\nShe has the endorsements, including with Visa and Ralph Lauren. She has posted on TikTok daily from Beijing. But U.S. coach Joel Johnson says to not pay attention to that side if Knight. He prefers to focus on who she is behind the scenes – a soft-spoken, quiet, intense leader off the ice.\n\n\"The one that people look to when they’re not sure where to look. The one who people trust in when they’re not sure who to trust,\" Johnson told USA TODAY Sports. \"I think the impact she has on her teammates is so meaningful.\"\n\nKnight already tied the U.S women's hockey record for most Olympic selections with four, and with another medal now assured in Beijing -- Team USA will play archrival Canada for gold -- Knight's hardware count (four) will be also tied for most all time.\n\n\"Consistency kills,\" Knight, who won gold in 2018 and silvers in 2010 and 2014, told USA TODAY Sports before departing for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nAt these Beijing Games, Knight has been a model of \"consistent\" production. She's recorded at least one point in five of six games and leads the team with nine points overall. And if the U.S. wins its second consecutive gold, it will be hard to find someone in USA hockey history whose résumé matches that of Knight.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhy are Olympic skiers in Beijing wearing tape on their faces?\n\nWhile watching the women's downhill, it's hard not to notice the blue tape on the faces of many of the skiers.\n\nAthletes in Beijing are using KT Tape to protect their skin from the freezing cold temperatures, but the CEO of KT Tape Greg Venner warns that the tape isn't clinically tested for faces.\n\nThe KT Tape that athletes are putting on their faces is normally used as an elastic sports tape to provide support for muscles, ligaments and tendons to allow for full range of motion. The tape is sponsored and used by several athletes in the Beijing Winter Olympics as well as the summer Olympics season.\n\nThere's no precedent for using the tape on faces or evidence that it protects people from the cold, and Venner says that athletes should be careful about using the tape on the delicate skin on their face.\n\n“We’ve seen KT Tape used as protection against the wind in winter sports over the years, so although it isn’t a clinically approved usage, we appreciate the ingenuity. KT Tape doesn’t endorse the use of kinesiology tape on the face as it isn’t clinically tested,\" Venner told USA TODAY. \"However, we certainly applaud the creativity – we are proud to support Team USA!”\n\n— Michelle Shen\n\nMikaela Shiffrin gains valuable experience in completing women's downhill\n\nBEIJING — Consider this preparation for the Alpine combined.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin raced the downhill for the first time at an Olympics on Tuesday. She didn't win a medal – she finished in 18th place, 2.49 seconds behind gold medalist Corinne Suter from Switzerland – but it gives her more experience on the course ahead of Thursday’s combined, which features a run each of downhill and slalom.\n\nUnlike her first few races in Beijing, Shiffrin was not expected to get a medal in the downhill.\n\nBut she had hoped to do all five individual races at the Beijing Olympics, something she couldn’t do four years ago after weather-related delays upended the schedule.\n\nExpected to contend for multiple medals in Beijing, Shiffrin has instead had a tough time. The two-time Olympic champion skied off the course five gates into the first run of both the giant slalom and slalom, her two best events, and was ninth in the super-G.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nTeam USA making a push to advance in men's curling with win over Switzerland\n\nBEIJING – It’s come down to crunch time for the U.S. men’s curling team. With three matches to go in round-robin play entering Tuesday and a 3-3 record, winning out would almost surely guarantee a place in the semifinals.\n\nTeam Schuster took care of business in the first of those matches and defeated Switzerland 7-4. The Americans were tied with the Swiss for fourth place; the top four teams advance to the semifinals. The U.S. lost the first end, but battled back to take a 2-1 lead at the end of the second. Clutch shooting in the seventh and ninth ends helped secure the victory.\n\nFor the U.S., friendly scheduling will be a boon. The final two games of the round-robin are against the bottom two teams in the standings, Italy (later Tuesday) and Denmark (Thursday). In other good news, Russia – another team that entered 3-3 and tied for fourth – lost to Norway 12-5. That means the U.S. is currently in sole possession of fourth place to give them some room for error, depending on how the tiebreakers shake out.\n\nA loss to Canada earlier in the tournament dropped Schuster and Co. to 2-3. But like they did four years ago in Pyeongchang, the Americans appear to be capturing momentum when it matters most.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEileen Gu takes silver in slopestyle to go with earlier big air gold\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – That it was expected made it no less remarkable.\n\nEileen Gu claimed her second freeskiing medal during these Beijing Olympics, setting her up for the unprecedented three medals she’s aiming for by the end of the week.\n\nNeeding to put down a big run to get in contention, Gu landed a double cork on her second to last jump, followed by a 900 to get on the podium.\n\nSwitzerland's Mathilde Gremaud took gold and Kelly Sildaru of Estonia won bronze.\n\nGu already claimed gold in big air’s Olympic debut last week.\n\nThe American-born teen is competing for her mother’s native China, a decision that has made her beloved here but also drawn criticism.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nAustria's Anna Gasser makes history in winning big air gold\n\nBEIJING – The first female snowboarder to ever land a cab double 1260 in competition did it again when it mattered most.\n\nAustria’s Anna Gasser, sitting in second place before her final run of the big air competition and needing to pull off a big trick to pass New Zealand’s Zoi Synnott-Sadowski for the lead, didn’t just land the 1260 Tuesday – she absolutely stomped it for a monster score of 95.5. It turned out to be more than enough for Gasser to win her second consecutive gold medal in this event.\n\nAs Gasser landed cleanly at the bottom of the Big Air Shougang, she put her hands to her head, almost in disbelief. Even for someone who has been dominant over the years in this discipline, pulling that off under such immense Olympic pressure was a tremendous feat.\n\nSynnott-Sadowski, who won the gold in slopestyle earlier in these Olympics and also took the big air title at the most recent Winter X-Games, had a shot to one-up Gasser and steal back the title. But her attempt at a double cork 1260 failed as she came in a bit too steep on the landing.\n\nThe way the competition set up, with snowboarders being scored on their two best jumps out of three, paved the way for a big dramatic finish and encouraged the riders to try for huge tricks towards the end.\n\nJapan’s Reira Iwabuchi, who was sitting in fourth place, even tried a triple cork on her final run in an attempt to make the podium. Though she didn’t quite land it, the other snowboarders rushed to congratulate her at the bottom of the hill for the audacious attempt.\n\nAt that point, the only question was how the top three would finish. After Japan’s Kokomo Murase missed on her third run, the path was cleared for Gasser to make one of the most dazzling runs of her legendary career.\n\nAmerican Hailey Langland, who squeaked into the final by a quarter of a point, was not able to land either of her first two tricks. Eliminated from medal contention, she took the safe route down the jump on her third try and settled for 12th place.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nCoaching change helps spur US women in aerials\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – On Monday night the American women qualified three for the finals and two in the superfinals of women’s aerials.\n\n“And that’s a quarter of the field so we all came out here and we put down our best jumps,” said the youngest member of the team, Kaila Kuhn, 18. “We really showed there’s a great future for the U.S. team.\"\n\nIt spoke to the strength of the women’s Team USA and the team in general.\n\n“I think the hard work that we've all put in - in the last few years, and Vladimir Lebedev became our head coach, that was a new shift for me as well,” said bronze medal winner Megan Nick Monday night. “And so that has really helped some of the athletes who have worked with him.\n\n“But all around just having Ashley Caldwell on the triple and being such a great role model for how we can keep pushing our ability and our degree of difficulty has been really beneficial.”\n\nLebedev was born and raised in Uzbekistan, earned a bronze medal at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Torino, and his uncle was president of the Uzbekistan Ski Association.\n\nWhen Lebedev took over in 2019, he immediately set his sights on the new Team Aerials event, which debuted here at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, and which the Americans won. Caldwell was the woman on the mixed team which earned her a gold medal.\n\nNick’s bronze is the first medal for the U.S. women's individual aerials in 24 years; Nikki Stone was the last to medal, at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, with gold.\n\n\"I know that interest in our sport in the U.S. has been dwindling,\" Nick said, \"so I just hope that our gold in the mixed team event and this medal – and hopefully another medal in the coming days – inspires kids around the nation to consider starting aerials.\"\n\n-- Lori Nickel\n\nSkating world offers near-unanimous rebuke of CAS ruling on Russia's Kamila Valieva\n\nShortly after the Court for Arbitration in Sport issued its ruling allowing Russian teenager Kamila Valieva to compete in the women's figure skating competition despite a positive drug test in December, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee issued a strong statement in opposition.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the message this decision sends,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland said. \"It is the collective responsibility of the entire Olympic community to protect the integrity of sport and to hold our athletes, coaches and all involved to the highest of standards.\"\n\nThat rebuke was mild compared to what other skating stars had to say. For example, NBC commentator and former U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir called the decision \"a slap in the face to the Olympic Games, to our sport and to every athlete that has ever competed at the Olympics clean.\"\n\nTeam USA finished second to Valieva and the Russians in the team figure skating competition earlier in the Games. Valieva will be the gold medal favorite when the women's individual competition begins on Tuesday.\n\nTeam USA curling squads in action Tuesday. Let's review the rules.\n\nThe U.S. men's curling team is currently battling Switzerland, which you can watch here or on CNBC. The squad currently holds a 3-3 record after six of 10 round-robin matches.\n\nAs you're watching maybe you're like us, thinking: What was that move for? Why did they do that? And what is with all the sweeping?\n\nWell we've got you covered. Here's a reminder of the rules of curling and more information about the event's schedule at the Winter Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin skis back into action in women's downhill\n\nBEIJING — Looking for a reason to stay up late? Mikaela Shiffrin is racing the Olympic downhill for the first time.\n\nThe downhill begins at 11 a.m. Tuesday Beijing time, so 10 p.m. Monday night on the East Coast. No doubt NBC was pleased with Shiffrin’s decision.\n\nShiffrin didn’t do the downhill at her previous two Olympics. She’d hoped to race it at Pyeongchang in 2018, but weather-related delays disrupted the schedule and she didn’t have enough time to train. Though she hadn’t been on downhill skis since December until the first training run Saturday, Shiffrin has decided to do the race.\n\n“It's going to be intense and a little bit of nerves but in general I think it's going to be really cool to be able to race,” she said. “One of my biggest goals coming here was to start in every event. At least that dream may still be alive.\"\n\nShiffrin is 12th on the start list, just in front of reigning Olympic downhill champion Sofia Goggia. Alix Wilkinson starts 21st and Keely Cashman will go 26th.

It is a towering, dramatic structure rising above a former industrial park where they used to mill steel, flanked by cooling towers that evoke images of nuclear winters moreso than the Winter Olympics.\n\nAnd yet it might just be the best idea the Chinese have had at these Beijing Games, writes USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken.\n\nBut are those towers really part of a nuclear power plant, as many social media posts have suggested?\n\nA USA TODAY fact check reveals they're actually industrial cooling towers from a now-closed steel mill.\n\nRussian teen skater Kamila Valieva cleared to compete\n\nBEIJING — Kamila Valieva has been cleared to compete at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a momentous decision, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled Monday in favor of the Russian figure skating superstar and the country's anti-doping agency, dismissing the provisional suspension that Valieva, 15, would have otherwise faced after she tested positive for a banned heart medication.\n\nThe CAS panel reasoned that the six-week delay from the time Valieva's sample was collected to the time she was informed of the positive result was \"not her fault\" and noted her special status as a \"protected person\" under world anti-doping rules, because she is not yet 16.\n\n– Tom Schad\n\nUS moves up medal count with four more on Monday\n\nAfter a stellar day for American women, the USA has moved into third place all by itself in total gold medals at the Beijing Olympics with seven.\n\nBobsledders Kaillie Humphries and Elana Meyers Taylor took gold and silver in the monobob, while first-time Olympian Megan Nick won a bronze in women's aerials and the ice dancing team of Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue also won bronze.\n\nTeam USA now has a total of 16 medals, which ranks third in the overall medal count behind Norway's 19 and the Russian Olympic Committee's 18.\n\nThe Norwegians also lead the way with nine golds.

And that's the ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nHeading into the Winter Olympics, there was much talk of two host cities – one inside a tightly-sealed bubble where the Games would be held, and one outside, where daily life would go on as normal.\n\nBut the past two weeks have also shown the world two very different Games: For China, Beijing 2022 was a resounding success that exceeded all expectations. To the rest of the world, it remained a deeply polarizing event, that projected not only China’s rising power but also its growing assertiveness, ready to defy and challenge its critics.\n\nIn its meticulously managed “closed loop,” the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing have paid-off. Infections brought into the country were swiftly identified and contained, allowing the Games to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nIn the medal tables, Team China claimed nine golds and a total of 15 medals, delivering its best ever result at a Winter Olympics – and ranking above the United States. The stellar performances of its new Olympic stars – from freeski sensation Eileen Gu to snowboard prodigy Su Yiming – captivated fans in the stands and across the country, drawing an outpouring of pride.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic run 01:29 - Source: CNN Hear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic run 01:29\n\nBy Wednesday, nearly 600 million people – or 40% of the Chinese population – had tuned in to watch the Games on television in China, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). And while US viewing figures have been markedly down compared to previous Olympics, the boost in Chinese audiences will likely make Beijing 2022 among the most watched Winter Games in history.\n\nEven the official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, a panda wearing an ice shell, turned out to be a domestic success. Having been mostly ignored for more than two years since it was first unveiled, the chubby bear soared in popularity during the Games, routinely trending on Chinese social media. At souvenir stores inside and outside the bubble, people queued for hours – sometimes in biting cold – to take home plush toy replicas.\n\nBeijing 2022's official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen has become a breakout star at these Games. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nAnd for the ruling Communist Party and its supreme leader Xi Jinping, it is the domestic audience that matters the most. Xi personally backed Beijing’s bid to host these Games, and made a flurry of visits to the ice rinks and snow slopes to inspect preparation work. The success of the Games present Xi with a moment of national unity as he gears up for an unprecedented third term in power this fall.\n\nBut for the Chinese government, part of the domestic success also comes from the avoidance of major political scandal or embarrassment. While the doping saga surrounding a teenage Russian figure skater has cast a shadow over the Olympics, it was downplayed inside China. The same was true of criticism of the Games in general, most of which was censored and blocked.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian figure skater's entourage under investigation 04:49 - Source: CNN Russian figure skater's entourage under investigation 04:49\n\nEarly in the Games, many athletes from Western countries were stunned by the stringent Covid restrictions they met upon arrival in Beijing. Some were placed in isolation for weeks after testing positive, while others complained about the bland food served in quarantine. But their criticism – including an emotional plea for help from a Belgian athlete – went wholly unreported inside China.\n\nInstead, Chinese state media avidly shared social media videos, posts and comments from athletes that portrayed their life inside the Olympic village in a positive light, praising the food, the Covid measures and the friendly volunteers.\n\nAnd much to the relief of government officials in Beijing, not a single athlete or Olympic attendee attempted to use the event to publicly protest China’s human rights record – a hot-button issue in the lead-up to the Olympics (though some have expressed critical views).\n\nIn December, the United States and its allies declared a diplomatic boycott of Games over China’s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang – which Washington has labeled a genocide. But apart from the notable absence of Western leaders at the opening ceremony, the impact of the boycott was seldom felt on the ground.\n\n“You can’t write stories about people who aren’t in Beijing – that’s the problem with the diplomatic boycott. There’s no story once the Games start,” said Susan Brownell, an expert on Chinese sports and the Olympic Games at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\n“I’ve predicted at the beginning that the political issues would fade into the background and the sports would take the headlines, and that would be the memory that would be left, at least for the general audience. I think that has largely happened,” added Brownell.\n\nGoing on the offensive\n\nBut Beijing wasn’t just waiting for the political controversies to fade. It has gone on the offensive, using the Games to push its own political message and hit back at criticism – despite having repeatedly derided Western governments for “politicizing” the Olympics.\n\nAs the torch relay got underway right before the Games, state media reported a Chinese soldier who was involved in a deadly border clash with Indian troops was among the chosen few to carry the Olympic flame. The report sparked immediate outrage in India, prompting New Delhi to join the US-led diplomatic boycott.\n\nThe next day, in a symbolic end to the highly choreographed opening ceremony, Chinese organizers chose Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a little-known Uyghur cross-country skier, to deliver the flame to the Olympic cauldron. (Her name could also be written as Dilnigar Ilhamjan.) To many outside of China, it was seen as a deliberate attempt by Beijing to confront critics over its treatment of the Uyghurs.\n\nTorch bearers Dinigeer Yilamujiang and Jiawen Zhao of Team China hold the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony on February 4. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nThen there came the high-profile appearance of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star and three-time Olympian who has been at the center of global concern after she was silenced for accusing a former top Communist Party leader of sexual assault.\n\nAt these Games, Peng met IOC President Thomas Bach for dinner, gave a sit-down interview to French sport news site L’Equipe – during which she denied she ever accused anyone of sexual assault or disappeared from the public eye – and was seen in the stands watching Team China compete in events like curling, figure skating and freestyle skiing.\n\nHer flurry of activities made headlines around the world – and like her previous public appearances, they failed to quell broader concerns about her freedoms. Inside China, however, none of that was reported by state media or shared on social media, where Peng’s name remains censored.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear details of rare Peng Shuai interview with Western media 02:05 - Source: CNN Hear details of rare Peng Shuai interview with Western media 02:05\n\nAnd as the Olympics approached its end, the political messaging got more pugnacious.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Yan Jiarong, a spokesperson for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympics Games (BOCOG), was asked whether Taiwan’s delegation would appear at the closing ceremony Sunday.\n\nYan, a former Chinese representative to the United Nations, took the opportunity to assert China sovereignty claims over the self-ruling democracy. “What I want to say is that there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an indivisible part of China,” she said.\n\nShe also jumped in on CNN’s question about whether the Olympics uniforms were made by forced labor in Xinjiang, calling accusations of forced labor “a lie made up by forces with ulterior motives.”\n\nYan’s comments – which appeared to be an outright violation of Olympic rules about political neutrality – prompted a rare rebuke from Bach, the IOC president.\n\n“We were in touch with the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) immediately after this press conference,” Bach said, “and both organizations, BOCOG and the IOC, have restated the unequivocal commitment to remain politically neutral as it is required by the Olympic charter.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government may see these combative remarks as a propaganda victory, for many in the international audience, they only serve as a reminder of how politically fraught these Games are, despite the organizational success and sporting achievements.\n\n“The Games as a standalone event have been run very well, and China did well. The organization has been phenomenal,” said Mark Dreyer, the founder of China Sports Insider in Beijing.\n\n“But again, it depends on what perspective you’re looking at. Are you just looking through that narrow lens? Because if you’re looking at China as a whole, the narrative (from outside China) is much more about China using these Games for sportswashing…I don’t think it’s really going to change people’s perspective on China as a country.”", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn'S Beijing Bureau"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/sport/roc-winter-olympics-beijing-russia-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "ROC at Beijing 2022: What is it and how can Russian athletes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEagle-eyed viewers watching the 2022 Beijing Games will once again notice a now familiar acronym – ROC, which stands for the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nIts significance? An opportunity for clean Russian athletes to compete in the Olympics while their country remains banned from the Games because of a doping scandal.\n\nRussian athletes will be competing under the neutral banner for the second consecutive Games after they did so at last year’s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThere are specific rules the ROC has to follow to distinguish itself from the country of Russia.\n\nBut first, here is a reminder of how events unfolded at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.\n\nRussia banned, but ‘clean’ athletes given lifeline\n\nIn December 2017, a little over two months before the start of the Winter Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced an unprecedented ban on Russia competing in South Korea as a result of the country’s “systemic manipulation” of anti-doping rules.\n\nBut there was a catch.\n\nRussian athletes who could prove that they were clean were “invited” by the IOC to compete as an “Olympic Athlete from Russia” (OAR), under the Olympic flag and anthem – in all, 168 athletes were eligible to compete in Pyeongchang.\n\nDespite being the third largest team at the Games, OAR only finished 13th in the medal table – winning two golds, nine fewer than at Sochi 2014.\n\nTwo OAR athletes failed drugs tests during the Games, but it wasn’t enough to prevent Russia from being welcomed back into the Olympic family shortly after the Games had concluded.\n\nThat, though, wasn’t to be the end of the story.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The 2018 Winter Olympics' most memorable moments 04:56 - Source: CNN The 2018 Winter Olympics' most memorable moments 04:56\n\nFurther Russian sanctions\n\nIn December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sporting competitions, including the Olympics, for four years over doping non-compliance.\n\nThe punishment was related to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of a 2016 report that uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.\n\nWADA’s compliance review committee suggested sanctions because the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) failed to fully cooperate during probes into the country’s sports.\n\nA year later, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) cut Russia’s ban in half to two years following an appeal.\n\nThe verdict means Russian athletes are currently unable to compete under their country’s name, flag and national anthem at major international sporting events until December 16, 2022 – thus covering both the 2022 Winter Games and 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nWADA, though, warned ahead of the Beijing Games that although Russia is now following anti-doping rules it shouldn’t assume sanctions will automatically lifted when the country’s suspension ends.\n\n“RUSADA needs to follow the rules, the requirements, and standards and so far they are doing it […] This is an ongoing process, this is not end of this chapter,” WADA President Witold Banka told Reuters in February.\n\nRussia’s flag and anthem, therefore, won’t be seen or heard at the Olympics until the 2024 Games in Paris at the earliest.\n\nThe creation of the ROC and Tokyo success\n\nIn February 2021, the IOC announced Russian athletes would compete under the acronym ROC at the Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022 Olympics.\n\nThe team would still bear the country’s colors of white, blue and red.\n\nBut instead of Russia’s flag, the ROC’s flag features its colors in an Olympic flame placed above the five Olympic rings.\n\nAs many as 335 athletes competed for the ROC in Tokyo with the team finishing 5th in the medal table – the most medals won by Russia’s athletes since Athens 2004.\n\nFurther success is now being forecast at the Beijing Games.\n\nTeam ROC celebrates winning the gold medal in the women's team gymnastic final at Tokyo 2020.

Before U.S. fans take consolation in this being par for the course, consider that the o-fer on Day 1 in 2018 was the first in 20 years.\n\nAnd while it’s probably not fair to compare Winter and Summer results, it is the third consecutive Olympics in which the Americans have come up empty-handed on the first day. The shutout at the Tokyo Games was the first time the United States had gone without a medal on the opening day since 1972.\n\nSo Team USA is trending, and it is NOT in the right direction.\n\nGranted, all of this will eventually be forgotten – perhaps as early as Sunday. The Americans will wind up leaving Beijing with a haul of hardware, and a lot of it will be gold.\n\nBut it seems somewhat apropos that when everything else about these Games has been a struggle, because of COVID-19 and the protocols Beijing organizers have implemented to prevent it, that the quest for the first U.S. medal should be, too.\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Subscribe to our Olympics newsletter to stay informed!\n\nThree errant shots on the last leg of the mixed relay doomed what would have been the first-ever U.S. medal in biathlon. The U.S. team was disqualified for a questionable blocking penalty in the semifinals of short track’s first-ever mixed relay. Jessie Diggins made a late charge in the skiathlon, but it wasn’t enough to get her on the podium.\n\nThe Americans had no shot at the podium in either women’s ski jumping or the 3,000 meters in speedskating, and it was probably too much to expect Nick Page to go from a qualifier to a medalist in his Olympic debut.\n\n\"It was an interesting call, for sure,\" Maame Biney said after the short-track team’s disqualification. \"But it is what it is. We're just going to focus on our next races.\"\n\nBut we’re Americans! We like winning, and we don’t like spreading the wealth with other countries. Even if it was kind of cool that Slovenia, with the gold and bronze medalists in women’s ski jumping, had matched its medals total in each of the last two Games before the first day was out.\n\nAnd that Norway, with golds in biathlon and cross-country skiing, and the Netherlands, with a gold in speedskating, proved there is still some consistency left in a world where seemingly everything has gone haywire.\n\nBesides, the U.S. drought isn’t likely to last long. Medals will be awarded in seven sports Sunday, and Americans will be contenders in at least two of them.\n\nJamie Anderson is the two-time defending Olympic champion in slopestyle, and she was fifth in qualifying even with a fall in her second run. Jaelin Kauf and Olivia Giaccio were 3-4 in moguls qualifying. Three U.S. men are in the top 20 in luge after the first two qualifying runs, including 2018 silver medalist Chris Mazdzer, who is ninth.\n\nEven if there’s another washout Sunday, it still won’t be reason to panic. Team USA still has Mikaela Shiffrin, Chloe Kim, Nathan Chen, Kaillie Humphries and Elana Meyers Taylor, the women’s hockey team – I could go on. At some point, somebody will win a medal and America can get back to doing what we do best.\n\nBragging, er, celebrating the accomplishments of our athletes.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.

Drew Commesso, who at 19 became the youngest U.S. goaltender at an Olympics, saved all 17 shots China put on net.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. men's hockey pulls away from China in second period\n\nThe U.S. men’s hockey team began pulling away from China in the second period of their opening-round game. The Americans lead 4-0 with 20 minutes to play and outshot China 16-6 in the frame.\n\nIt started with Sean Farrell’s behind-the-back pass – from behind the net – to Noah Cates for the team’s second goal. With the teams taking penalties four seconds apart, Brian O’Neil – the lone member of the current Olympic squad from the roster four years ago – made it 3-0 after Andy Miele stayed tough on the puck in front of the net and slid a pass across the front of the crease.\n\nWith 1:53 to go in the period, Farrell received a pass on a 3-on-2 advantage and kept it. That proved wise. He found the top shelf for his second point of the night.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nBrendan Brisson's goal gives U.S. men's hockey first-period lead vs. China\n\nUniversity of Michigan forward Brendan Brisson buried the United States hockey team's first goal on their second power play of the first period to give the U.S. a 1-0 lead against China in its opening-round game.\n\nHe had fed Matt Knies down low, and Knies drove at China goaltender Jeremy Smith. Knies found the rebound in the slot and fed Brisson, who hammered it past Smith on a one-timer.\n\nIt was a physical first period; the officials prevented a pair of fights, although Justin Abelkader was ready to square up with China captain Brandon Yip. The U.S. outshot China 16-11.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. men's hockey starts without Jake Sanderson, a top defenseman\n\nBEIJING – The U.S. men’s hockey team opened Olympic play against China on Thursday without one of its top defenders.\n\nJake Sanderson, a University of North Dakota defenseman and fifth overall pick by the Senators in 2020, was not listed on the team’s lineup. The Associated Press reported he is expected to arrive in China Thursday night.\n\nSanderson remained in Los Angeles after the team departed the States due to COVID-19 protocols. He will be tested upon his arrival in Beijing, as is protocol for all members of the Games’ “closed loop.”\n\nDrew Commesso, a Boston University goalie, will start in net for the Americans. The biggest name on China is Jake Chelios, who's the son of Hockey Hall of Famer Chris Chelios.\n\nAt 19, Commesso is the youngest goaltender in U.S. Olympic history\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSA wins gold in first Olympic mixed team aerials event\n\nBEIJING – The American freestyle skiing team added a third gold medal of the day to Team USA’s tally in Thursday in the mixed team aerials event, which is new to the Olympics this year.\n\nEssentially, teams of three – two men and one woman – each get one jump off a ramp in each round of the competition. The skiier is judged on their form while in the air, how high and far they launch off the ramp and the landing. The scores are added cumulatively, and because all the scores count, there’s not much margin for error.\n\nThat worked to the Americans’ favor as their three competitors made some key errors in the last round of the competition. The U.S. team, by contrast, made clean runs in the final and put enough distance between themselves and China – which had the last jump – to hold on for the gold medal.\n\nIt turned out to be a fairly close call, as China’s Qi Guangpu had a terrific final jump, but the U.S. held on to win by over 14 points, scoring a 338.34.\n\nThe competition turned with the second jump of the final round when American Christopher Lillis executed a flawless launch and got rewarded with a 135.0 from the judges, which was the highest score for any individual jump. China’s Jia Zongyang skidded into a somersault on his landing and lost significant ground, scoring just a 96.02.\n\nThat gave the U.S. a solid, but not iron-clad lead going into the final jumps. Justin Schoenefeld solidified it with a 114.48.\n\nAshley Caldwell, a four-time Olympian and 2017 World Champion in aerials, had the second-best score among the women in the final round.\n\nThe mixed team aerial event was a bit of a wildcard event making its Olympic debut. There also wasn’t much of a track record for it during the World Cup season, though the Chinese team won both competitions held in December.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nTherese Johaug wins gold in 10K classic\n\nThe Norwegian great added another title to her tally by winning the 10-kilometer classic race five days after winning the first gold medal of the Beijing Olympics.\n\nJohaug glided around the cold, windy course in 28 minutes, 6.3 seconds.\n\nKerttu Niskanen of Finland, who started after Johaug, was 11 seconds ahead at the 8.6-kilometer mark but lost some time in the final stretch. She crossed the line only .4 seconds behind the Norwegian.\n\nJohaug missed the 2018 Pyeongchang Games after being suspended in a doping case involving a steroid in lip balm.\n\n“When your career is up and down and you are being so down, it means more when you are coming back and you reach your goal,” Johaug said. “You have to work, work, work and you can reach your goal and do the best of the situation you are in.\n\n“That was my mind when I’ve been out for two years.”\n\nJohaug won the skiathlon on Saturday, the first gold medal awarded at the Beijing Games. After that race, she said “when you have tasted this gold medal, you want more.”\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nTeam USA added two more gold medals. Here's what you missed overnight Wednesday:\n\nTeam USA faces China in men's hockey\n\nTaile Wang. Jieruimi Shimisi. Wei Ruike.\n\nThose are three of the names on the Chinese men’s ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics.\n\nAny of them ring a bell? Well, you might know them by their actual names.\n\n“Wang” is Tyler Wong. “Shimisi” is Jeremy Smith. Ruike’s “former” name is Ethan Werek.\n\nEighteen of the 25 players listed on China’s roster were either born or raised in North America. But as the country prepared to host the Games, it needed to field a competitive team. NHL players were originally supposed to compete here, meaning officials couldn’t rely on the native crop of players without risking embarrassment (they nearly did, anyway).\n\nInternational Ice Hockey Federation bylaws stipulate that a person can represent a country in the Olympics if they’ve lived there for two years and played for the national team. Kunlun Red Star is a Beijing-based team in Russia’s pro league, the KHL. Many of the players began playing for Kunlun in 2019. According to the Associated Press, those who are U.S. or Canadian citizens have not been asked to renounce their Canadian citizenship.\n\nChina will play Group A of the Olympics tournament with Germany, Canada and the United States.\n\nThe U.S. and China begin play Thursday night in Beijing (8:10 a.m. ET in the United States).\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nMikaela Shiffrin will race in super-G\n\nBEIJING — Mikaela Shiffrin isn’t leaving the Beijing Olympics without a fight.\n\nThe two-time Olympic champion plans to start the super-G on Friday. She had left open the possibility of skipping it after a second consecutive race ended five gates into the first run.\n\n“The hill on the speed track looks pretty incredible and I think it would be a pleasure to ski,\" Shiffrin said Wednesday. “But I also have some teammates who are really fast, and we have the athletes who can fill the spaces. If I’m going to ski out on the fifth gate, like, what’s the point?”\n\nThat was said when the shock and disappointment of her Did Not Finish in the slalom was still fresh, however. After training Thursday, she decided to give it a go.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nMikaela Shiffrin's boyfriend, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, wins another medal\n\nBEIJING — Mikaela Shiffrin’s boyfriend is gaining on her.\n\nAleksander Aamodt Kilde won silver in the Alpine combined Thursday, three days after winning a bronze in the super-G. The medals are the first at an Olympics or world championships for the Norwegian, who was the overall champion in 2020.\n\nShiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist, celebrated Kilde’s “beautiful dancing feet” in a post on Twitter.\n\n“Literally hasn’t skied a run of slalom in years and then went and DID THAT,” Shiffrin wrote. “What an athlete!”\n\nAustria’s Johannes Strolz won gold, his family’s second medal in the event that features a run of both downhill and slalom. Strolz’s father Hubert was the Olympic champion in the combined in 1988, when it returned to the Olympic program for the first time in 40 years.\n\nCanada’s James Crawford won the bronze.\n\nKilde’s success has been a rare bright spot in Beijing for Shiffrin, who skied out after the fifth gate in the first run of both the slalom and giant slalom races. He tore his ACL while training in January 2021 but has made an impressive comeback this season, winning six of his 11 World Cup starts since Dec. 3.\n\n“He’s been working so hard to get an Olympic medal his whole career and he’s had some really bad luck,” Shiffrin said Wednesday.\n\nKilde has been equally supportive of Shiffrin, posting a sweet message on Instagram after her DNF in the slalom Wednesday.\n\n“The pressure we all put on individuals in the sports are enormous, so let’s give the same amount of support back,” Kilde wrote. “It’s all about the balance and we are just normal human beings!! I love you Kaela.”\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nSpanish snowboarder Queralt Castellet wins her first medal in her fifth Games\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Queralt Castellet remembered her first Olympics, the 16-year-old watching in Torino as the medalists climbed atop the podium.\n\nDreaming of being there seemed so far off. Spain had four Winter Olympics medals ever at that point, and none since Albertville in 1992. Castellet hadn’t even made the final.\n\nBut seeing Americans Hannah Teter and Gretchen Bleiler win gold and silver, respectively, and Norway’s Kjersti Buaas claim bronze set in motion a dream that led to the Olympic podium in Beijing.\n\nCastellet, now 32, claimed silver at these Winter Olympics, finishing second to American Chloe Kim in her fifth Games.\n\n“I was far away from even thinking that the podium was a possibility, but when I saw the girls up there, who back then were my heroes, I did set up a dream,” Castellet said. “My dream was to be up there like them, and it happened today, 16 years after.\n\n“After five Games, I can tell you it’s been a life, a career completely dedicated to snowboarding, dedicated to a dream of an Olympic medal.”\n\nCastellet worked over the years to improve, finishing 12th in Vancouver in 2010 and 11th in Sochi in 2014. Four years ago, she was seventh as Kim won her first medal.\n\nOn Thursday, Castellet finished her run with back-to-back 900s to take silver.\n\nAlready Spain’s youngest Winter Olympian when she looked up to those riders in Torino, she became its oldest medalist and the first woman from her country to medal since 1992.\n\n“I wanted this very much, and I’ve been working for this over many years,” Castellet said. “After so many efforts at the Games, it’s easy to begin doubting and asking why I don’t achieve. And finally being able to do it is, simply, something I’m very proud of.”\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA's Nick Baumgartner emotional after being eliminated in snowboardcross\n\nNick Baumgartner summed up being eliminated in the snowboardcross quarterfinals as “heartbreak.”\n\n“I don't think people know how much we put into this. I put so much time and effort and then one little mistake and it's gone,” Baumgartner said in an emotional post-race interview. “I'm 40 years old, I'm running out of chances. So much support back home and I feel like I let them down. This one stings. This one hurts.”\n\nBaumgartner got knocked out in the quarterfinal by Austria’s Julian Lueftner and Team USA’s Jake Vedder despite taking an early lead.\n\nThe four-time Olympian pledged to keep racing and end his career on a positive note.\n\n“I ain't stopping on this. I've gotta do something better to end with,” he said while fighting back tears.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nChloe Kim is hungry again at the Olympics\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — Would it be an Olympic halfpipe final if Chloe Kim weren’t hungry?\n\nFour years after she tweeted about being hangry from the top of Pyeongchang course, the competition here left the now two-time Olympic gold medalist needing food.\n\nAfter answering this reporter’s question during the press conference, Kim added, “Also, if anybody has some snacks in their pockets, maybe. I’m starving.”\n\nQuickly, snacks materialized. The U.S. Ski & Snowboard press officer gave her a chocolate bar. Someone else handed her another bar, and a worker at the Genting Snow Park media center went to collect crackers and Swiss rolls.\n\nThough Kim had pointed out that it was, indeed, lunch time following her morning competition, she declined the offer to eat before finishing with questions.\n\nHours before she would get her second gold medal, Kim left the press room with something that was probably more valuable in that moment – a heaping handful of food.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA sends three to men's snowboardcross quarters\n\nThe men’s snowboardcross quarterfinals will feature three members of Team USA.\n\nAlthough he needed a second preliminary run to determine his seeding, Mick Dierdorff raced patiently and seized his opening on one of the final turns to hit the last jump ahead of the other riders to win his heat. The 2019 world champion placed fifth in PyeongChang four years ago.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the quarterfinals by Nick Baumgartner, who held off teammate Hagen Kearney to advance. Baumgartner finished just ahead of Deirdorff in South Korea (fourth).\n\nIn the final heat, Jake Vedder rode to a photo finish against Julian Lueftner of Austria. The 23-year-old appeared to yell “Let’s go baby!” as he crossed the finish line first, just ahead of Lueftner, who also advanced.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nNathan Chen blows away the field in men's figure skating\n\nBEIJING — For almost four years now, Nathan Chen has been the most dominant male figure skater in the world – a cool, quad-jumping maestro unlike anything the sport has ever seen. He's won national and world championships. Broken national and world records. Over a span of more 1,300 days, he did not lose a single competition.\n\nAll that had been missing in this marvelous four-year stretch was an Olympic gold medal.\n\nMissing, that is, until Thursday.\n\nAlmost four years to the day after a disastrous performance in Pyeongchang, Chen aced his final appearance at the 2022 Winter Olympics and coasted to gold, becoming just the seventh American man to win the men's individual competition at the Games.\n\nSkating to a compilation of music from the 2019 film \"Rocketman,\" the 22-year-old was equal parts graceful, technical and fun in his four-minute performance at Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing. He landed all five of the quad jumps in his long program for a score of 218.63, pushing his total for the competition to 332.60.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nJason Brown is USA's other medal hopeful in men's figure skating\n\nThe elder statesman of the U.S. men's figure skating contingent at age 27, Jason Brown is back in the Olympics after serving as the first alternate for the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.\n\nBrown helped the USA win bronze in the men's team competition in Sochi in 2014, while finishing ninth overall. More recently, he served as team captain and finished sixth as the U.S. won silver at the 2021 World Championships.\n\nBrown has had to overcome injuries and a concussion sustained in a car accident on his way to returning to the Olympic Games after just missing out four years ago. But his selection to the 2022 U.S. team over 17-year-old Ilia Malinin did not come without some controversy.\n\nBrown set a personal best in the short program and stood sixth overall behind leader Nathan Chen. He skated a clean free program and took over second place overall with just five skaters left.\n\n— Steve Gardner\n\nNBC defends Shiffrin coverage, suggests sexism by critics\n\nNBC offered a full-throated defense of how it covered Mikaela Shiffrin's shocking Olympics flameout.\n\nNBC's cameras focused on Shiffrin for much of the time as she sat forlornly on the course, head bowed, for more than 20 minutes. The network aired a raw interview where she fought off tears and said she's second-guessing everything she's done for 15 years.\n\n“We have an obligation in that moment, as the broadcaster of the Olympic games, to cover the moment,” Molly Solomon, executive producer of NBC's Olympics coverage, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “There's no script when there's a wipeout on the slopes or a fall in figure skating. We're watching real people with real emotions in real time and we did everything we were supposed to do.”\n\nShiffrin's performance was huge news, she said — the biggest story of the Games so far.\n\n“I've thought a lot about this, and if Joe Burrow or Matthew Stafford sit on the sidelines 22 minutes after the Super Bowl on Sunday, you can bet the cameras are going to stay on them,” Solomon said.\n\n“Here we are in 2022 and we have a double standard in coverage of women's sports,” she said. “Women's sports should be analyzed through the same lens as the men. The most famous skier in the world did not finish her two best events. So we are going to show her sitting on the hill and analyze what went wrong. You bet we are.”\n\nViewers tuning into NBC’s coverage expressed pity and confusion over why Shiffrin's pain was plastered on their TVs for so long.\n\nKeith Kaufman, a clinical sports psychologist, told USA TODAY it's no surprise that \"the media tends to want to focus on the drama, which may seem like it makes for good television, but it adds another layer to the distress that an athlete is experiencing.\"\n\n— Associated Press\n\nNathan Chen in driver's seat entering men's free skate\n\nAmerican figure skater and three-time world champion, Nathan Chen claimed the highest short program score ever (113.97) in international competition history Tuesday, positioning himself to thrive in the men's free skate competition in Beijing.\n\nThe 22-year-old student at Yale University was favored to win gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, but finished 17th due to a devastating short program performance. Since then he has claimed three world championships and four national titles on his journey to Beijing.\n\nThe 24 skaters in the men's final began competition at 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday (9:30 a.m. on Thursday in Beijing). The performances go in order of lowest to highest score, meaning Chen will skate last in the final group, a bit after 12 a.m. ET.\n\n— Analis Bailey\n\nChloe Kim soars to second consecutive halfpipe gold\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Chloe Kim has made Olympic history. The 21-year-old American won the halfpipe for a second consecutive Games, making her the first woman to win two Olympic gold medals in the event.\n\nAs she did four years ago in Pyeongchang, Kim entered as the overwhelming favorite and ran away with the competition.\n\nKim locked up the contest on her first run, putting down a safety score on her first lap down the halfpipe. She did a 900 and two 1080s – at that point, most riders hadn’t done one 1080 – to easily take the lead.\n\nKim has long stood atop her sport, but on Thursday at Genting Snow Park, she did what so many other great riders have tried. Americans Kelly Clark and Hannah Teter and Australian Torah Bright all have at least one other medal to go with their Olympic gold, but none was able to get back atop the podium.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nIranian skier tests positive for banned steroid\n\nIran’s only male athlete at the Beijing Olympics has tested positive for an anabolic steroid in the first confirmed doping case at the Games.\n\nThe International Testing Agency says Alpine skier Hossein Saveh Shemshaki failed a drug test on Monday in Beijing, before competing.\n\nHe is provisionally suspended and cannot compete at what was to be his third Olympics.\n\nThe 36-year-old raced in slalom and giant slalom at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and four years later at Sochi. He carried Iran’s flag at the opening ceremony in Sochi.\n\nHe can appeal against his provisional ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Beijing.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nFavorite for gold in women's figure skating has positive drug test\n\nBEIJING – The medal ceremony for the Olympic figure skating team competition has been delayed by a positive drug test among the gold-medal-winning Russian team, and officials have been told that the athlete who tested positive is a minor, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe only minor on the six-person Russian team that won gold was Kamila Valieva, 15, the gold-medal favorite in the women’s competition later in the Games.\n\nRussian newspaper RBC reported that Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, a heart medication that has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency since 2014 because it can improve endurance and blood flow.\n\nA spokesperson for the Russian Olympic Committee has not responded to an email seeking comment.\n\n— Christine Brennan\n\nLong road back to Olympics for cross-country skier Rosie Brennan\n\nRosie Brennan simply wasn’t feeling like herself at the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\n\"I was just really exhausted all the time,\" said Brennan, who at age 29 had made her first U.S. Olympic team in cross country skiing, but finished 58th in the 15-kilometer skiathlon. \"It was almost like an out-of-body experience.\"\n\nMonths later, Brennan found out she’d been suffering from mononucleosis. To add insult to illness, she was dropped by the U.S. national team for the second time due to her subpar results that season.\n\nBrennan thought about calling it a career, but the perseverance that drives cross country skiers kept her on track.\n\nBack for her second Winter Olympics, Brennan, 33, finished fourth in the women's sprint and 14th in the skiathlon. She hopes to compete in every women’s cross country event in Beijing.\n\n(UPDATE: The U.S. team has been announced for Thursday's 10K classic and Brennan is on the start list -- along with two-time Olympic medalist Jessie Diggins, Hailey Swirbul, and Novie McCabe.)\n\n— Karen Rosen\n\nWhy are Olympians in Beijing putting tape on their faces?\n\nAthletes in Beijing are using KT Tape to protect their faces from the freezing cold temperatures, but the CEO of KT Tape Greg Venner warns that the tape isn't clinically tested for faces.\n\nThe KT Tape that athletes are putting on their faces is normally used as an elastic sports tape to provide support for muscles, ligaments and tendons to allow for full range of motion. The tape is sponsored and used by several athletes in the Beijing Winter Olympics as well as the summer Olympics season.\n\nThere's no precedent for using the tape on faces or evidence that it protects people from the cold, and Venner says that athletes should be careful about using the tape on the delicate skin on their face.\n\n“We’ve seen KT Tape used as protection against the wind in winter sports over the years, so although it isn’t a clinically approved usage, we appreciate the ingenuity. KT Tape doesn’t endorse the use of kinesiology tape on the face as it isn’t clinically tested,\" Venner told USA TODAY. \"However, we certainly applaud the creativity – we are proud to support Team USA!”\n\n— Michelle Shen\n\nJamaican bobsledder fights through grief to make Olympic return\n\nBEIJING – Team Jamaica’s entrance to Friday’s opening ceremony was a joyous sight, with Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian leading a band of dancing, waving, gyrating bobsledders in unmistakably neon yellow pants.\n\nBut for Fenlator-Victorian, every moment in Beijing is a struggle between joy and grief, between the emotions pulling her home and the understanding that this is where she needs to be, between the sense of accomplishment in just getting here and the sacrifices she made to bring her third trip to the Olympics into existence.\n\n“I’m so happy to be here and press on and share that part of my journey,” she told USA TODAY Sports. “But I’d lying if I said it wasn’t extremely difficult.”\n\nRaised in New Jersey and now living in Texas, Fenlator-Victorian knew full well when she left Team USA after the 2014 Olympics to compete under the Jamaican flag that she was choosing the harder road. In some ways, that was the point.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nWhat is ROC at the Winter Olympics?\n\nRussia's involvement in a doping scandal is once again in the spotlight for the 2022 Beijing Olympics with its athletes unable to compete under their country's name for the third Olympics in a row.\n\nRELATED: Team medals for figure skating delayed by Russian drug test\n\nWhile Russia can't participate in the games, a loophole allows its athletes to as long as they adhere to certain rules, like not wearing the Russian flag or singing the Russian national anthem.\n\nAthletes are able to compete under the umbrella of an organization called the ROC, which stands for Russian Olympic Committee. It effectively renders the Olympic ban against Russia for its doping program to a symbolic gesture by allowing its clean athletes to still participate.\n\n-- Michelle Shen\n\nFigure skating will stop calling women skaters 'ladies'\n\nIn 1924, figure skating became the first sport in the Winter Olympics to allow women to compete. But though the men competed under categories for “men,” women could onlycompete under “ladies.”\n\nFigure skating is also the last winter sport to change that naming convention: The 2022 Winter Olympics is the first to let women compete as women, not ladies. It’s a subtle change — one that audiences may miss — but a meaningful one. For a century, figure skating has clung to rigid gender rules, about everything from costumes to who can compete as a pair, that have enforced specific expectations about how athletes should look or behave. Some skaters have even reported hiding their gender identity in order to conform.\n\nThis year, more out LGBTQ skaters, including the first out nonbinary Winter Olympian, will compete in the Games than ever before. This year there will be nine openly LGBTQ figure skaters in Beijing. There were three in 2018 and none in 2014.\n\n-- Chabeli Carrazana, The 19th\n\nOlympic ice a proving ground for future NHL stars\n\nWhen the Olympic Athletes of Russia won the gold medal in the non-NHL 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, some prominent future NHL players were on the roster.\n\nForward Kirill Kaprizov, who scored the overtime winner in the gold medal game, would become NHL rookie of the year last season and an All-Star this season with the Minnesota Wild. Backup goalie Ilya Sorokin is establishing himself as the No. 1 goalie with the New York Islanders. Igor Shesterkin, the extra goalie in those Games, is a midseason favorite for the Vezina Trophy with the New York Rangers.\n\nU.S. forward Troy Terry, meanwhile, made the NHL All-Star Game with the Anaheim Ducks during a breakout season.\n\nThe NHL won't have players at the Beijing Olympics. But with the men's hockey competition getting underway, we've identified six 2022 Olympians (three from Team USA) who could develop into key players in the NHL.\n\n— Mike Brehm", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}]}

His latest comments are some of the strongest Trump has made toward Russia.\n\nUkrainian leaders committed to the 30-day ceasefire, which would freeze the conflict along current battle lines, on Tuesday after holding talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe United States resumed intelligence sharing and military assistance to Ukraine after Zelenskyy agreed to the ceasefire deal, the first step in trying to end the latest deadly conflict that started in February 2022.

During his nightly address to his nation, Zelenskyy said Sunday that his delegation has a “clear task” to do everything to ensure a meeting between the two presidents, the Associated Press reports.\n\nZelenskyy said there are daily discussions between the two countries via video conference. He said the talks are necessary to establish a cease-fire and more humanitarian corridors. He said those corridors have saved more than 130,000 people in six days.\n\nThe humanitarian convoy to the besieged city of Mariupol was blocked Sunday by Russian forces. Zelenskyy said they would try again Monday.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Russia's negotiator and President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, confirmed the daily talks, the BBC reports.\n\nIn a video posted on social media and in a subsequent tweet, Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine's negotiator and a Zelenskyy adviser, said Russia was beginning to engage constructively.\n\n\"Russia now much more adequately perceives the world around it,\" Podolyak said. \"It is much more sensitive to the position of Ukraine, which has been proven in battlefields, and in Ukraine's actions in terms of protecting its interests.\"\n\n►'MASS CASUALTY SITUATION': Downtown Kyiv hospital braces for carnage doctors fear will come\n\n►'WORSE THAN HELL': Mariupol mother fears for her daughter as Russia lays siege to the Ukrainian city\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday.

Germans carried flags in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine during protest in Berlin spurred by trade workers.\n\nAnti-war protests were also staged in Warsaw, London and the German cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Small vigils took place in Russia as well, despite a crackdown by authorities against demonstrations.\n\nRussian protests against the war in Ukraine have been typically met with a heavy police response.

Mariupol in particular is being \"martyred by the ruinous war\" raged by Russia against Ukraine, he said. He implored leaders to \"listen to the cry of those who suffer\" and end the bombings.\n\n\"Faced with the barbarism of the killing of children, and of innocent and defenseless citizens, there are no strategic reasons that hold up,\" Francis said. \"The only thing to be done is to cease the unacceptable armed aggression before the city is reduced to a cemetery.\"\n\nRussia could be preparing to use chemical weapons\n\nRussia could be preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, an act that would draw a \"severe price,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Sunday.\n\nSullivan told CBS News that Russian rhetoric is increasingly claiming the Ukrainians and Americans will potentially use chemical or biological weapons \"and that's an indicator that, in fact, the Russians are getting ready to do it, and try and pin the blame elsewhere and nobody should fall for that.\"\n\nAsked what consequences would result, he said he would not go beyond what President Joe Biden indicated on Friday: \"They will pay a severe price.\"\n\n\"We have communicated that directly to the Russians,\" he said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nRussian yachts being seized across Europe\n\nRussian yacht owners are encountering rough seas around the world as nations sympathetic to Ukraine's plight press sanctions that include impounding assets of Russia's wealthy class. World leaders hope harsh economic sanctions that target Vladimir Putin's inner circle of oligarchs could apply pressure on the Russian president to end his brutal military assault on Ukraine. Italy announced Saturday that it had seized a $580 million superyacht linked to Russian energy and fertilizer magnate Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko. Several other yachts have been seized in recent weeks in Italy, Germany and Fance.\n\nSullivan: US nuclear posture hasn't changed\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday the U.S. has seen no reason to change its nuclear posture in light of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine or threats involving nuclear weapons. In the opening days of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin indicated that if the U.S. and other NATO allies continued to impose heavy sanction against the Russian economy, or if they attempt to aid Ukrainian forces, the Kremlin would be ready to respond with nuclear weaponry.\n\n\"We are watching this extremely closely. And obviously the escalation risk with a nuclear power is severe, and it is a different kind of conflict and other conflicts the American people have seen over the years,\" Sullivan said. He noted that \"as things stand today\" the U.S. isn't making an adjustment to its nuclear posture, \"but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour.\"\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk polls: Russian Americans, Ukrainian Americans oppose war\n\nU.S. residents who identify with Russian or Ukrainian heritage express strikingly similar views about the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, a pair of exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls finds. The two groups are united in their opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war being fiercely fought on his orders.\n\nThe invasion is opposed by nearly everyone in both groups: 87% of Russian-Americans and 94% of Ukrainian-Americans. Those of Russian descent have a more positive view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (72%) than they do of Putin (6%). By nine-to-one, they say Putin should be removed from office.\n\n\"Somebody just needs to extract him,\" said Dina Sarkisova, 44, who owns a spa in San Diego and participated in the survey. Half-Russian and half-Azeri, she came to the United States as a refugee in 1990, fleeing conflict in Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union collapsed. \"There's no reasoning with him.\"\n\nRead more on the polling and the voices of those polled here.\n\nDeath toll in battered Mariupol surpasses 1,500, mayor says\n\nIn Mariupol, which has endured some of the worst punishment since Russia invaded, efforts to bring food, water and medicine into the port city of 430,000 and to evacuate civilians, were prevented by unceasing attacks. More than 1,500 people have died in Mariupol during the siege, according to the mayor's office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves. Russian forces shelled a mosque sheltering over 80 children and adults in Mariupol, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Saturday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to break his country apart, as well as starting “a new stage of terror” with the alleged detention of a mayor from a city west of Mariupol.\n\n“Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,” Zelenskyy said during his nightly address to the nation Saturday.\n\nRussian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach Mariupol and blocked another, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening their siege of the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUkraine government: 85 children killed by Russian attacks\n\nSince Russian attacks on Ukraine began, 85 children have died, the Ukrainian government said Sunday morning. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova gave the casualty number in a tweet, adding the toll the war has taken on schools.\n\n\"Deliberate and brutal shelling of civilians continues. 369 educational institutions were damaged, 57 of which were completely destroyed,\" she said.\n\nBus with refugees overturns in Italy, 1 dead\n\nItalian state radio says a bus carrying about 50 refugees from Ukraine has overturned on a major highway in northern Italy, killing a passenger and injuring several others, none of them seriously. RAI radio said one woman died and the rest of those aboard the bus were safely evacuated after the accident early Sunday near the town of Forli’. It wasn’t immediately clear where the bus was headed.\n\nAbout 35,000 Ukrainians refugees who fled the war have entered Italy, most of them through its northeastern border with Slovenia. Forli’ is in the region of Emilia-Romagna, which borders the Adriatic Sea and which so far has taken in about 7,000 refugees.\n\nThe accident is under investigation.\n\nA third Russian general has died in fighting, Ukraine officials say\n\nA Russian general was killed in fighting at Ukraine's southern city Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nMaj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov would be the third Russian general to die since the invasion of Ukraine began, making an unusual loss of such a high-ranking military official during fighting. Kolesnikov was the commander of Russia's Eastern Military District, according to Ukraine's military.\n\nRussia did not confirm Kolesnikov's death, and has not shared many details about its military losses during the invasion of Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division, and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, who had fought with Russian forces in Syria and Chechnya, had previously been reported killed.\n\nUkraine: 7 dead, including one child, in attack on humanitarian corridor\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said Saturday that seven people, including one child, were killed Friday by Russian soldiers while traveling along a humanitarian corridor, calling the act a “military crime.”\n\nThe ministry claimed Russian soldiers shot at a group of civilians, consisting primarily of women and children, behind “the agreed ‘green’ corridor.” The attack allegedly occurred during an evacuation attempt in the village of Peremoga, which is in the Baryshevskyi district of the Kyiv region. The number of non-fatal injuries from the shooting is unknown, the agency said.\n\nThe defense ministry additionally claimed that after the shooting, Russian soldiers would not allow other individuals to escape.\n\n“At present, it is practically impossible to contact them, as well as to provide humanitarian and medical care,” the agency said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nMore Ukraine-Russia coverage", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere’s a look at the life of Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: January 25, 1978\n\nBirth place: Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine\n\nBirth name: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky\n\nFather: Oleksandr Zelensky, computer science professor\n\nMother: Rimma Zelenska, engineer\n\nMarriage: Olena (Kiyashko) Zelenska (2003-present)\n\nChildren: Oleksandra and Kyrylo\n\nEducation: Kyiv National Economic University, law, 2000\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts:\n\nFormer comedian, actor, writer and producer.\n\nHis best known role was in the television series “Servant of the People.” He played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after video of his anti-corruption rant goes viral.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Zelensky's unorthodox path to leading and inspiring Ukraine 03:05 - Source: CNN Zelensky's unorthodox path to leading and inspiring Ukraine 03:05\n\nTimeline:\n\n1990s - Forms a comedy troupe with college friends called Kvartal 95.

I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We’ll see if they follow through what they’re suggesting,” Biden said at the White House, where officials were busy digesting intelligence and reports from the ground that Russian troops were moving their focus away from Ukraine’s capital toward other areas of the country.\n\nBiden’s don’t-trust-but-verify approach reflects deep American skepticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motives amid his monthlong invasion of Ukraine. While the US has observed movements of Russian forces away from Kyiv, there remains doubt the Russian assault on Ukraine will end soon.\n\nSome Western officials viewed Russia’s moves as a mere tactical exercise amid a stalled campaign in Ukraine. US officials also said Russia could always reverse itself if the battle conditions allow.\n\nSimilarly, American officials appeared wary of voicing optimism about ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which both sides suggested Tuesday had yielded progress. Instead, Biden was focused on ensuring the stringent sanctions regime he’s enacted with European allies remains in place as the hostilities continue.\n\nMeeting in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian teams began outlining the contours of a settlement, including discussions over the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and Donbas, the eastern region that Russia claims is independent. Ukraine’s neutral status and international security guarantees are also up for discussion, as is a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nUS officials have questioned Putin’s seriousness in negotiating an end to the violence from the start of the crisis. Some have also made plain they aren’t certain of Zelensky’s endgame in the talks and are wary of whatever concessions he may offer.\n\nSpeaking in the East Room alongside the visiting Singaporean Prime Minister, Biden said he’d discussed the nascent peace talks with European leaders on a 53-minute telephone call earlier in the day. He said there was a “consensus” among the leaders to “let’s just see what they have to offer. We’ll find out what they do.”\n\n“In the meantime, we’re going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We’re going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves and we’re going to continue to keep a close eye on what’s going on,” Biden added.\n\nBiden’s aides echoed his sentiment, saying that while there were signs of troop movements, a new strategy did not appear afoot.\n\n“We have no reason to believe that they have adjusted, that they’ve adjusted that strategy,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said during a daily briefing. “Obviously, we continue to do everything we can to impose costs for this decision.”\n\nSpeaking on a diplomatic visit to Morocco, Secretary of State Antony Blinken cautioned the pullback of troops could amount to “a means by which Russia once again is trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking it’s not doing what it is doing.”\n\n“If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ‘only’ – in quotation marks – the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,” Blinken said at a joint news conference with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita.\n\nAnd the Pentagon cautioned that while “small numbers” of Russian forces have moved away from Kyiv “in the last day or so,” Russia can still inflict “massive brutality” on the city.\n\n“We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,” said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby at a briefing. “Nobody should be fooling ourselves by the Kremlin’s now recent claim that it will suddenly just reduce military attacks near Kyiv, or any reports that it’s going to withdraw all its forces.”\n\nKirby said that the number of Russian forces moving away from the Ukrainian capital is “not anywhere near the majority of what they have arrayed against Kyiv,” and that Russia has continued airstrikes against the city “even today.”\n\nHe added, “It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.”\n\nFor its part, Moscow was quick to clarify its announced plans of deescalating near Kyiv did not amount to a ceasefire. Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky told Russian state-owned channel RT the first step agreed by Russia in talks with Ukraine “concerns a gradual military de-escalation in two main directions, Kyiv and Chernihiv,” adding, “We understand that there are people in Kyiv who need to make decisions, so we do not want to expose this city to additional risk.”\n\nBiden’s phone call with European allies came days after he had returned to Washington from a last-minute trip to Belgium and Poland meant to reinforce American commitment to the region’s security. He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nMacron in particular has acted as an interlocutor between Putin and the West, and the two men spoke Tuesday after the group call with Biden. The French President had warned against escalating the crisis after Biden said in Warsaw that Putin “cannot remain in power.”\n\nThe White House said that remark – which Biden sought to explain Monday as an emotional response to meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw – did not arise on his Tuesday morning phone call.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "One million refugees flee Ukraine as Russia escalates ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia’s relentless bombardment of residential areas across Ukraine has so far forced more than one million refugees to flee the country in just seven days, according to the United Nations, as fierce fighting continues into its second week.\n\nFilippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: “I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.”\n\nBy comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nHalf a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II.\n\nMillions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: “International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing – nothing – can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy.”\n\nIn Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol, home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive.\n\nA woman sits in a tent as people take shelter in the Dorohozhychi subway station in Kyiv on Wednesday. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nA resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a “humanitarian catastrophe,” telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities.\n\nAccording to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine – particularly insulin – with pharmacies being looted.\n\nThe resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.\n\nThe mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” – indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.\n\nIn Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis.\n\n“They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,” Sergei Orlov told CNN’s “New Day.” “We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating.”\n\nFurther north, Ukrainian resistance in the country’s second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN.\n\nIn a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: “You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there’s no weapon you wouldn’t use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine.”\n\nA man passes an apartment building hit by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine on Wednesday. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nMost of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine’s west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.\n\nWorryingly, a “big number” of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland’s Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents – particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.\n\nHumanitarian corridors\n\nOn Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.\n\nSenior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: “The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.”\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.\n\n“We have thoroughly discussed three points – military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,” Medinsky told journalists.\n\nAnother member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the “nearest future.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.\n\nThe European Union has made the “historic decision” to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc’s Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.\n\nBachelet said: “Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.”\n\nWith the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office “had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.”\n\nThe move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially “tens of thousands” of troops.\n\nThe Russian government has “strongly” rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was “gravely concerned” by “reports of the use of cluster munitions” by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.\n\n“We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs – which are banned under the Geneva Convention,” she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.\n\nThe Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.\n\n“It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,” NATO’s former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN.\n\nHe said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins.\n\n“I’m afraid to say I don’t think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that’s likely to happen,” Shirreff added.", "authors": ["Helen Regan Paul P.

Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine – including increased weapons supplies and military training – constitutes a growing threat on Russia’s western flank.\n\nThe picture is complicated – but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nWhat’s the situation on the border?\n\nThe United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as “unusual.”\n\nAs many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine “as soon as early 2022.”\n\nSpeaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had “ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine’s border, which it could double on relatively short order.”\n\nIn late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware – including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles – on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country.\n\nThe assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution.\n\nUS officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two.\n\nMany of Russia’s military bases are to the west of the vast country – the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia’s Defense Ministry has said it is conducting “regular” winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as “temporarily occupied territories,” although Russia denies it.\n\nThe front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists.\n\nRussia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014.

AP\n\nWhat’s the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks – reportedly under pressure from Moscow – weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence.\n\nThen, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed “little green men” and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol the area surrounding the Ukrainian military unit in Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Crimea, on March 20, 2014.

Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations.\n\nAccording to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014.\n\nThe European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia’s actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nThe Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country’s east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement.\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to support the withdrawal of troops on February 19, 2015 in Artemivsk, Ukraine. Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s Russia’s view?\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO – in terms of weaponry, training and personnel – as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia’s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nPutin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a “red line” for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. “And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,” he said.\n\nIf the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the “right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests.”\n\nWhat is Ukraine’s view?\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses.\n\n“Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion.\n\n“Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,” it added.\n\nUkraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia’s plan ahead of a military invasion. “External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,” he said.\n\nTensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.\n\nAt the same time, Zelensky’s government faces challenges on many fronts. The government’s popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy.\n\nMany people are also unhappy that the government hasn’t yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country’s east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv.\n\nIn a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to “calm down” amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. “We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,” he said, before adding that he “sincerely believes” this year “will pass without a war” with Russia.\n\nKuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. “No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,” he said.\n\nPro-Russian fighters arrive on February 20, 2015 in Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine. Pierre Crom/Getty Images\n\nWhat does NATO say?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said “there will be a high price to pay for Russia” if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner.\n\n“We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,” said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses “with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia … but also in the Black Sea region,” Stoltenberg said.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn’t have the same security guarantees as NATO members.\n\nBut Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership.\n\nHigh-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were “not an easy discussion,” according to Stoltenberg, who added that “differences will not be easy to bridge.” However, NATO allies and Russia “expressed the need to resume dialogue,” he said.\n\nWhat does the United States say?\n\nPresident Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies “will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.”\n\nBut Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a “minor incursion” by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country.\n\nWhile Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,” he said.\n\nHis remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. “President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CNN he was “shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion” and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. “This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,” the official added.\n\nThe diplomatic kerfuffle came as Blinken prepared for further talks with European allies on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Blinken has previously warned Russia that “any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences.”\n\nTwo defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance.\n\nThe US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration is now weighing new options, including providing more arms to Ukraine to resist a Russian occupation, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation.\n\n“Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,” Blinken said late last year.\n\nWhat other factors are at play?\n\nUnrest in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan was unwelcome news for Putin at the beginning of 2022.\n\nDeadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency be declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest.\n\nBut experts have warned that Russia’s intervention is unlikely to be the end of the story. Blinken said that “once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave.”\n\nAnother issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nKyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAnalysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany.\n\nIn November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.", "authors": ["Matthew Chance Laura Smith-Spark", "Matthew Chance", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/politics/ukraine-100-days-western-allies-regular-meetings-potential-ceasefire/index.html", "title": "Western allies meet regularly to game out potential framework for ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nStaring down the prospect of an extended stalemate in Ukraine, the US and its allies are placing a renewed emphasis on the need for a negotiated settlement to end the war as the conflict grinds into its 100th day with no clear victory in sight for either side.\n\nUS officials have in recent weeks been meeting regularly with their British and European counterparts to discuss potential frameworks for a ceasefire and for ending the war through a negotiated settlement, multiple sources familiar with the talks told CNN. Among the topics has been a four-point framework proposed by Italy late last month. That framework involves Ukraine committing to neutrality with regard to NATO in exchange for some security guarantees, and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the future of Crimea and the Donbas region.\n\nUkraine is not directly involved in those discussions, despite the US commitment to “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” US and Ukrainian officials said the US has not been pressuring Ukraine to commit to a certain plan or directly pushing them to sit down with the Russians.\n\nStill, there is some confusion about what kind of framework the US would consider appropriate to bring to the Ukrainians for further discussion.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters earlier this week that the Italian framework is “one of those initiatives that we certainly would love to see bring a conclusion to this horrific war and the horrific attacks on the Ukrainian people.” But two US officials told CNN that the US actually does not support the Italian proposal.\n\nIn any case, US and western officials tell CNN that there is a growing concern that if the Russians and Ukrainians don’t get back to the table and work out a deal, the war will drag on – potentially for years.\n\nSubtle language shift\n\nIt’s not clear whether these discussions will translate into eventual settlement talks. The Biden administration still sees no real prospect for any diplomatic breakthroughs or ceasefires anytime soon and two NATO officials said that the western alliance sees little appetite to negotiate on the Ukrainian side – in part because Russia’s brutal bombing campaign and myriad human rights violations have destroyed public support for any concession to Russia.\n\nA view shows an apartment building destroyed during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine April 3, 2022. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nMoscow has also showed little interest in serious talks, officials say. Right now, Ukraine remains focused on ensuring a decisive military victory in the east and the south in order to put themselves in a superior negotiating position, these sources said.\n\n“We can propose all the plans we want, but unlikely Kyiv will go for anything that cedes territory at the moment,” according to one official.\n\nThe concern that the conflict could grind on indefinitely – with mounting costs – has been reflected in the subtle shift in language and messaging by US officials over the past several weeks.\n\nIn April, the US’ stated goal was for Russia to “fail,” a National Security Council spokesperson said at the time, and for the Russian military to be significantly “weakened” in the long term, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin proclaimed – comments that reflected optimism that Ukraine might be able to defeat Russia decisively on the battlefield after successfully defending Kyiv.\n\nBut as an effective stalemate has taken hold on the battlefield, with Russia making incremental gains in the east and Ukraine saying it is increasingly outgunned and outmanned, senior Western officials – including US President Joe Biden – are emphasizing anew that even with advanced western weaponry, Ukraine’s prospects for peace will ultimately rest on diplomacy.\n\n“As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said, ultimately this war ‘will only definitively end through diplomacy,’” Biden wrote in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday. “Every negotiation reflects the facts on the ground. We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.”\n\nThe hope, officials said, is that the US can support Ukraine long enough to see it through to a peaceful settlement rather than a full capitulation.\n\n“Wars are unpredictable,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Thursday. “We were able to predict the invasion, but how this war will evolve, it’s very hard to predict. What we do know is that almost all wars end at some stage at the negotiating table.”\n\nBut there are no indications yet that either Ukraine is giving up, or that Russian President Vladimir Putin will reverse what he’s doing inside Ukraine, one administration official told CNN. There are also no signs that Putin is willing to negotiate in good faith to end the war.\n\n“We just don’t know” yet what might change Putin’s mind, the official added.\n\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office on Sunday, May 29, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits the war-hit Kharkiv region. Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/AP\n\nOfficials have been careful to note that the US is not pushing for Ukraine to cede any territory to Russia, and have said from the beginning of the war that the US will avoid getting directly involved in any Russia-Ukraine negotiations. One source said that any pressure the US and the West places on Ukraine to negotiate will erode Kyiv’s leverage in future talks.\n\n“It’s not for us to decide or to have strong opinions [on] what Ukraine should accept or not accept,” Stoltenberg said Thursday.\n\nBut some Ukrainian officials are still wary that the west will try to impose a deal on them, one Ukrainian source told CNN. Zelensky and his senior advisers have publicly ruled out making any territorial concessions to Russia.\n\n“Those who advise Ukraine to give something to Russia, these ‘great geopolitical figures,’ never see ordinary people, ordinary Ukrainians, millions living on the territory they are proposing to exchange for an illusory peace,” he said in a video address late last month.\n\nLonger conflict, higher costs\n\nThe war has settled into a grinding slog that intelligence and military officials believe will last many months, if not years. Although the two sides may trade small swathes of territory back and forth from day to day or week to week, multiple officials with access to the latest intelligence told CNN that they do not expect either Russia or Ukraine to break through the existing battle lines anytime soon.\n\nAn elderly woman walks away from a burning house garage after shelling in the city of Lysytsansk at the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas on May 30, 2022. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor now, that effective stalemate presents an opportunity for the US to slowly bleed Russia of both blood and treasure, multiple military officials said. But the longer the conflict drags on, the higher the costs for the West – and the greater the challenge the Biden administration will face in supplying Ukraine, finding sustainable replacements for Russian oil and gas, and keeping an already-fractious European alliance committed to its strategy.\n\nThe issue is particularly politically fraught heading into election season, with gas prices continuing to rise largely because of the measures the west has taken to cut off imports of Russian oil and gas.\n\nThat has led to some debate within the administration about how much further to go with sanctions. Some officials are concerned that new tough moves – like imposing secondary sanctions on countries that don’t comply with US restrictions on Russian energy exports – could roil energy markets even further. And there is a growing acknowledgement that sanctions will not be a “knock-out punch” to Russia, but rather a “stranglehold” that could take years to produce meaningful consequences, one senior official said.\n\nAs the US looks to maintain its military and financial support for Ukraine and isolate Russia for as long as it takes to get to a peace agreement, a key strategy will be keeping the NATO alliance unified. But already, sources say, there are cracks appearing in NATO – Turkey is refusing to allow Sweden and Finland to move forward with joining the bloc, and diplomats had to carve out an exception for Hungary as part of Europe’s recent oil embargo against Russia.\n\nThere’s also the challenge of maintaining domestic support for funding Ukraine’s war. There’s been growing opposition among Donald Trump-aligned Republicans with each assistance vote that Congress has taken, one Democratic lawmaker noted. He added that there are concerns over how willing Congress will be in the future to fund a protracted conflict.\n\n“We have some runway between now and the end of the year,” the lawmaker said, referring to the $40 billion Ukrainian assistance package Biden signed into law last month.\n\nAnother top priority will be to continue to procure enough sophisticated weaponry to feed a high-attrition, artillery-heavy war without depleting US stockpiles. One option under consideration is to restart production lines for Soviet-era systems that the Ukrainians already know how to use. But the US also wants to transition Ukraine to NATO-compliant weapons systems, which are easier to produce and procure than the older Soviet systems. But even that comes with its own long-term challenge: Ukraine’s military will need more training to operate the western systems.\n\nStill, US officials have pointed to the more advanced weapons already on the battlefield, like the howitzers, that have helped Ukraine significantly to stop Russia’s advances.\n\n“I think we’re not seeing the Ukrainian defenses buckle,” said Colin Kahl, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for policy. “They’re hanging on, but it is a grinding fight.”\n\nStoltenberg put it succinctly on Thursday. “We just have to be prepared for the long haul,” he said, “because what we see is that this war has now become a war of attrition.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Katie Bo Lillis Barbara Starr Jeremy Herb", "Natasha Bertrand", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Barbara Starr", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/africa/ethiopia-civil-war-truce-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "Ethiopia: Warring parties agree to a truce in two-year civil war ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, he was lauded as a regional peacemaker. A year later, he launched a conflict that spiraled into a brutal civil war, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nIn November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised that the clash would be resolved quickly. Two years on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people and given rise to a wave of atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the use of starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nEthiopia was struggling with significant economic, ethnic and political challenges long before a feud between Abiy and the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), bubbled over into unrest and threatened to pull Africa’s second-most populous country apart.\n\nNow, after years of grinding conflict, the Ethiopian government and the leadership of the TPLF have agreed to cease hostilities and pull the country back from the brink. But the surprise truce leaves many questions unanswered, with few details on how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s happening in Ethiopia.\n\nHow did the conflict start?\n\nAn Ethiopian refugee prays at an Orthodox church near a refugee camp in Gedaref, eastern Sudan, on December 6, 2020. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Tigray conflict has its roots in tensions that go back generations in Ethiopia.\n\nThe country is made up of 10 regions – and two cities – that have a substantial amount of autonomy, including regional police and militia. Because of a previous conflict with neighboring Eritrea, there are also a large number of federal troops in Tigray. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines.\n\nBefore Abiy Ahmed came to power, the TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party’s authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign.\n\nIn 2018, Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to quell tensions and bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he became prime minister, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nIn his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party, Abiy sparked fears in some regions that the country’s federal system – which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states such as Tigray – was under threat. Leaders in Tigray withdrew to their mountainous heartland in the north, where they continued to control their own regional government.\n\nTensions boiled over in September 2020, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by going ahead with regional parliamentary elections that he had delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Abiy called the vote illegal and lawmakers cut funding to the TPLF leadership, setting off a tit-for-tat series of escalations between the regional and the federal government.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, after accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle and attempting to steal its weapons, Abiy ordered a military assault against the group, sending in national troops and fighters from the neighboring region of Amhara, along with soldiers from Eritrea. Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF leader, said in an op-ed in Foreign Policy that the group attacked the base in an “act of self-defense.” CNN cannot confirm the claims of either side.\n\nAbiy declared the offensive a success after just three weeks, but the conflict dragged on for two years, with both sides trading control over the regional capital Mekelle, gaining and losing ground.\n\nAn earlier humanitarian ceasefire broke down in August and fighting has intensified in the months since. The clashes, combined with a lack of fuel and the communications blackout, has severely curtailed aid distribution to the region.\n\nOn October 17, amid reports of heavy bombing in Shire and other Tigrayan cities, and food supplies running out in the regional capital Mekelle triggering fears of famine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the situation in the Tigray region was “spiraling out of control,” and that the violence had “reached alarming levels.”\n\nThe UN chief called for an “immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia,” and the urgent resumption of talks, which had been due to take place in September.\n\nA damaged tank on a road north of Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on February 26 EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat does the peace agreement actually mean?\n\nAfter just over a week of formal peace talks mediated by the African Union (AU) in South Africa’s administrative capital Pretoria, delegates from both sides of Ethiopia’s war agreed to a “permanent cessation of hostilities.” The surprise truce was signed by Getachew Reda from the TPLF and Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopia’s federal government, on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the war, on November 3.\n\nThe document laid out a number of key objectives, including the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country.\n\n“We have agreed to permanently silence the guns and end the two years of conflict in northern Ethiopia,” both sides said in a joint statement, published after delegates shook hands.\n\nThose involved in mediating the deal signaled that it was just the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace. Mediators have also warned that forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact. Still, the UN has called it a “critical first step” towards ending the conflict.\n\n“This is not the end of the peace process but the beginning of it,” said Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU’s high representative for the Horn of Africa and a former Nigerian president, who first announced the deal.\n\nAbiy, whose military, backed by Eritrean forces, has made rapid gains in Tigray over recent weeks, celebrated the conclusion of the talks, saying: “Our commitment to peace remains steadfast. And our commitment to collaborating for the implementation of the agreement is equally strong.”\n\nBut how the deal will be implemented is unclear, with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers.\n\n“These kinds of agreements should include constructive ambiguity, on the issues that are contested,” Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on Ethiopian politics at Bjorknes University College in Norway, told CNN. “But here it’s not constructive it’s more destructive, in that it will undermine the trust process and could possibly jeopardize the durability of the agreement.”\n\nRepresentatives from Ethiopia and the TPLF and mediators at a press conference announcing the agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere are a number of points in the agreement that Tronvoll said raise concerns, particularly one issue that was omitted entirely: the status of Eritrean forces in Tigray, which the text makes no mention of in spite of their outsized role in the conflict. Though the agreement states that the Ethiopian military will be deployed along the country’s borders, it does not specify whether they will ensure Eritrea’s withdrawal. “I don’t see any sustainable peace process if Eritrean forces are still on the ground,” Tronvoll said.\n\nThe deal is widely being seen as a capitulation by the TPLF, which, by Getachew’s own account, have suffered huge losses since hostilities resumed. “In order to address the pains of our people, we have made concessions because we have to build trust,” he said, adding that civilians and fighters were dying as he spoke.\n\nThe swift 30-day timeline for the overall disarmament and demobilization of Tigrayan fighters has raised eyebrows. And the agreement does not outline what force will replace them to provide security guarantees for Tigray’s civilian population, who have suffered widespread abuses at the hands of Ethiopian forces.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Ethiopian government will ensure “accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims,” but ultimately how that accountability might come about is opaque.\n\n“It’s one of the key issues left unanswered … how accountability will come about,” Tronvoll said. “Ultimately it is the generals and Abiy Ahmed himself who should be held to account. I don’t know if anyone believes he’ll sign off on an agreement in which he would be put on trial.”\n\nWhat atrocities have been committed in the conflict?\n\nFor months at the start of the conflict, Abiy denied that civilians were being harmed or that soldiers from Eritrea had joined the fight. But reports from international observers, human rights groups and CNN proved both of those claims wrong.\n\nThousands of people have died in the fighting, by many estimates, with reports of razed refugee camps, looting, sexual violence, massacres and extrajudicial killings. Many more have fled to Sudan, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees from Ethiopia seen in two decades. They describe a disastrous conflict that’s given rise to ethnic violence.\n\nEthiopia’s government has severely restricted access to journalists, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors’ accounts.\n\nBut evidence of atrocities began to leak out last year.\n\nTigrayans grieve by a mass grave in the city of Wukro, north of Mekele, on February 28, 2021. EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN investigations have uncovered evidence of massacres carried out in two Tigrayan towns, by Eritrean forces in Dengelat, and by Ethiopian soldiers in Mahibere Dego. A CNN team on the ground in central Tigray last April captured Eritrean troops – some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms – operating with total impunity, manning checkpoints and blocking vital humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after Abiy pledged to the international community that they would leave.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray.\n\nEritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities. Ethiopia’s government has pledged investigations into any wrongdoing.\n\nThe conflict, which erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades, plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity. The UN has repeatedly issued warnings about de facto humanitarian aid blockades, barring critical food and assistance to Tigray.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is blocking aid. But days after the UN’s aid chief warned Tigray was facing a “man-made” famine, Ethiopia ordered seven senior UN officials to be expelled from the country, including from organizations coordinating relief efforts.\n\nThere are currently about 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million in desperate need of healthcare, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn the same day that the truce was announced, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it had been two months since the last humanitarian aid reached the region, and that large numbers of displaced people were arriving in or moving toward Mekelle seeking assistance every day.\n\n“Since the beginning of the siege, food, medicine and other basic services have been weaponised,” Tedros said. “It has now been more than two months since the last humanitarian aid reached Tigray. But even before that, the aid reaching Tigray was a trickle – nowhere near enough to meet the needs.”\n\nHow did Abiy win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed campaigns in Jimma on June 16, 2021. Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than a year before Abiy launched an assault on his own people, he described war as “the epitome of hell” during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the honor for his role in ending a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for pushing significant reforms in Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was once a part of Ethiopia, but won independence in 1993 after a 30-year armed struggle. From 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war that killed thousands on both sides, which led to a long, dangerous stalemate and a total freeze in cooperation.\n\nOnce in power, Abiy moved quickly to normalize relations with Eritrea, in part by accepting the ruling of an international commission on boundaries between the two states.\n\nAbiy also made significant moves towards domestic reforms, raising hopes that he would bring about lasting change. As well as forging a truce with Eritrea, he lifted a severe security law, released thousands of political prisoners, moved to open up the telecommunications industry and expand private investment.\n\nBut his reputation as a leader who could unite Ethiopia has swiftly deteriorated, and his much-lauded peace deal with Eritrea appears to have paved the way for the two countries to go to war with their mutual foe – the TPLF.\n\nSince the conflict began, ethnically-driven violence has broken out into other parts of the country, including in Abiy’s home region, Oromia, the country’s most populous region. Last May, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group, vowed to wage “total war” against Abiy’s government.\n\nDespite promises to heal ethnic divides and pave the way for a peaceful, democratic transition, Abiy has increasingly invoked the playbook of repressive regimes: Shutting down internet and telephone services, arresting journalists and suppressing critics. Abiy has also been criticized for fueling “inflamed” rhetoric amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces he has described as “weeds” and “cancer.”\n\nLast July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray – a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised would be realized.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/27/biden-trump-presidential-debate-fact-check/74160563007/", "title": "Fact check of presidential debate: What did Trump, Biden get wrong?", "text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both strayed repeatedly from the truth as they squared off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nHere are the claims the USA TODAY Fact Check Team dug into.\n\nBiden claim: We lowered the cost of an insulin shot from $400 to $15\n\n“We brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400.”\n\nThis is false. The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n“The border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.”\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council – the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents – posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, “To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.”\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n“I've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.”\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it’s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n“I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.”\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a “bad thing.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump ‘worst’ president in history\n\n“(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. … He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that’s what they voted.”\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in “overall presidential greatness,” behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as “the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.”\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n“If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.”\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state’s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz’s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to “local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.”\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n“Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No,” Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had “announced the full mobilization” of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n“Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record ‘approval rating’ from VA\n\n“I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.”\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump’s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n“The number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That’s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I’m his political opponent\n\n“He [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.”\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“When you’re dealing with state prosecutions, it’s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,” said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. “That has nothing to do with the federal government.”\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n“I didn’t have sex with a porn star.”\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans ‘super predators’\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of “predators” in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as “super predators.” Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n“People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n“The corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.”\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to “plus beyond that.” He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you’ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden – Joe Biden's son – guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” he said. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues – specifically, those related to gender identity – remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden – hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history – marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections “on Day 1” of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we’ve debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel’s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America’s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is “time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,” laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them “a beautiful thing to watch.” But he’s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n“Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,” Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.”\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we’ve already addressed:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime … in the future.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he’s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump’s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border – where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 – prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation’s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n“Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said at the time. “Why? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement “to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,” according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were – and still are – reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue – even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust – and abide by – the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness.” The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election “hacking.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump’s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate – his first of the presidential election cycle – with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 – days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party’s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump’s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The International Crane Foundation says that, for the second year in a row, wild-hatched chick W7-17 was the first to arrive at the refuge in Decatur. The 2-year-old arrived Nov. 9. She’s among about 100 whoopers in a flock taught to migrate from Wisconsin to Florida by following ultralight aircraft. Crane foundation outreach assistant A.J. Binney says about one-third of them winter in Alabama. So do about 20,000 sandhill cranes. A tracking map shows about 14 whooping cranes at the refuge. The refuge website says whoopers have been seen around the visitor center and wildlife observation building in recent years. The refuge’s annual Festival of the Cranes will be held Jan. 11-12.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaskans have experienced both a record-high temperature and a record amount of snowfall in the same day. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Municipality of Anchorage saw snowfall of more than a foot Saturday after tying a temperature record set in 1967. The National Weather Service says the city tied the high-temperature record by reaching 45 degrees Fahrenheit about 3 a.m. The weather service says southeast winds blew warm air into the city before the winds subsided, temperatures dropped, and snow fell. Snow levels at the weather service’s office broke the 1958 record of 8.3 inches by a tenth of an inch. Officials say the snow varied from 5 inches in the city to more than 12 inches in nearby Eagle River.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: With climate change cranking up the heat and intensifying droughts, more than 400 people from across the state gathered Friday and Saturday to brainstorm solutions for reducing planet-warming pollution and preparing for a hotter, drier future. Among them were young activists who see climate change as the defining issue for their generation. The time to act is now, they said. “This is rapid change, and we should do something about it before it’s too late,” said Alicia Rose Clouser, a 13-year-old eighth grader from Sinagua Middle School in Flagstaff and a member of the Navajo Nation. “My people will be suffering for generations on if we don’t do something.” The two-day conference at Northern Arizona University brought the students and teen activists together with academics, health officials, tribal representatives, environmentalists, representatives of farming businesses, urban planners and city officials, and people from the community who said they wanted to be part of the discussion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: State highway officials have designated a stretch of Arkansas 22 as “True Grit Trail” in honor of the classic novel by Arkansas native Charles Portis. The state Department of Transportation unveiled the commemorative signs Thursday along the highway in Fort Smith and Dardanelle. The signs came about after state lawmakers unanimously approved legislation earlier this year. The bills, sponsored by Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, said that part of the highway should be designated as True Grit Trail to honor Portis’ 1968 novel, which has served as the basis of two feature films.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A month after two men were arrested at an illicit marijuana farm on public land in the state’s wilderness, authorities are assessing the environmental impact and cleanup costs at the site. A group including Forest Service rangers, scientists and conservationists hiked into the so-called trespass grow where 9,000 cannabis plants were illegally cultivated in the Shasta Trinity National Forest. Officials say trees were clear-cut, waterways diverted, and the ground littered with containers of fertilizer and rodenticide. The cleanup efforts are spearheaded by the group Cannabis Removal on Public Lands Project. CROP is a coalition of conservation organizations, tribes, elected officials, police and federal land managers. Also lending its support is the legal cannabis industry, which says it’s being undercut by the criminal market.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: The leader of this western Colorado community that relies on tourism is vowing to do everything he can to stop the proposed expansion of a nearby limestone quarry. The Glenwood Springs Post Independent reports Mayor Jonathan Godes called the proposal by RMR Industrial a “regional threat” in announcing the city’s campaign against it Friday. He said the city is committing $1.25 million to fight the expansion but promised to provide any other needed resources. The Bureau of Land Management is starting an environmental review of the proposal to expand the quarry from 23 to 321 acres and remove millions of tons of rock a year. RMR didn’t respond to requests for comment on the campaign but previously said the quarry is a “healthy commercial alternative” that will employ 100 people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A new report says the state has had the most metal theft insurance claims in the country. The National Insurance Crime Bureau issued a report recently that found that Connecticut had the most metal theft insurance claims per capita in 2017 and 2018. The state had almost 32 theft claims for every 100,000 residents. According to the report, thieves mostly steal copper and metal piping. The bureau says any place where copper is present is at risk of being stolen. Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi says this kind of theft is typically driven by “an urgent need for quick cash” and drugs. According to a Council of State Governments report, the national number of metal thefts is probably higher because no states comprehensively track that crime.\n\nDelaware\n\nSmyrna: Police are trying to identify the remains of a young girl who was found dead and released facial reconstruction images Monday of what the girl may have looked like when she was alive. The girl, who was between the ages of 2 and 5, was found in September near the Little Lass softball fields in Smyrna. Police said she was dead for several weeks, if not longer, when she was found. The girl had slightly wavy brown hair and was Caucasian or Hispanic. She also may have suffered from a chronic disease. Smyrna police are working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Delaware Division of Forensic Science. Anyone with information should contact detective Bill Davis at 302-653-3490.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A bill that would decriminalize sex work in the nation’s capital won’t move forward this year. The Washington Post reports the bill’s death comes after an emotional hearing that lasted 14 hours. Thousands of emails about the bill revealed a deep divide between district residents. Councilman Charles Allen, who chairs the committee that heard the testimony, says the bill lacked the support to pass a committee vote. Councilman David Grosso wrote the bill in collaboration with a coalition of district sex workers and says it should be brought to the ballot box. He says the bill was undermined by Chairman Phil Mendelson, who has opposed the bill since its initial iteration was proposed in 2017. Mendelson disagreed, saying his office primarily heard negative feedback about the bill.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A dozen municipal utilities in the Sunshine State are breaking ground on one of the largest municipal solar projects in the nation. The utilities broke ground Monday in the Orlando area for the project that will have 900,000 solar panels installed at two sites. Jacob Williams, the CEO of Florida Municipal Power Agency, a wholesaler, says the utilities can make solar power more affordable by working together. When it is finished, the project is expected to be able to power the equivalent of 45,000 Florida homes. The municipalities involved are in Alachua County, Bartow, Fort Pierce, Homestead, Jacksonville Beach, Key West, Kissimmee, Lake Worth Beach, Ocala, Orlando, Wauchula and Winter Park.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Two historic black churches founded in the 1880s have been listed among the state’s most threatened historic buildings. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation released its annual list of “places in peril,” including Antioch Baptist Church in tiny Taliaferro County, which was founded by freed slaves in 1886 and features striking Gothic-revival towers. The Georgia Trust says water damage is taking a toll inside and outside the church, which could face more neglect because regular services are no longer held there. Asbury United Methodist Church is the only African American United Methodist church in Savannah’s Victorian District. The 1887 building still has an active congregation, but water damage has left portions of the building unusable. The Georgia Trust says the congregation is struggling to raise money for repairs.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahuku: The ability of protesters to block construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain is inspiring efforts to stop other contentious projects across the state. Since July, protesters have stalled construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea. Leaders of fights against a wind farm and the redevelopment of a beach park say they are employing similar methods to those used at Mauna Kea. Organizers of the movements say they are rooted in a philosophy of peace and nonviolence known in Hawaiian as kapu aloha. The movements share several traits. Like on the Big Island mountain, there are protest camps on Oahu featuring a large tent with food and supplies. They even have so-called universities offering lessons and workshops on subjects ranging from civil disobedience to pounding taro, a popular root vegetable in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities say a lawsuit seeking to ban black bear hunting using bait in national forests in Idaho and Wyoming to protect grizzly bears should be dismissed. The U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in documents filed Friday say the decision to allow using bait to attract bears should continue to be made by the states in which the national forests are located. Western Watersheds Project, WildEarth Guardians and Wilderness Watch filed the lawsuit in June, contending the federal agencies are violating environmental laws because black bear hunters using bait have killed at least eight threatened grizzly bears since 1995 in national forests. Idaho, Wyoming and the hunting group Safari Club International have intervened in the case on the side of the federal government.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has named recipients of the 2020 Order of Lincoln, the state’s highest honor for professional achievement and public service. Pritzker announced honorees Scott Altman, originally from Pekin, a former NASA astronaut; Paul “Doug” Collins of Benton, an NBA All-Star and coach; and Robert “Robb” Fraley of Hoopeston, a former Monsanto Co. executive. Other honorees are Donald F. McHenry of East St. Louis, former United Nations ambassador and permanent representative; Dr. Joanne C. Smith, president and CEO of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab for physical medicine and rehabilitation; and Chicago native Mavis Staples, a rhythm and blues and gospel singer and civil rights activist. The recipients will be honored in April 2020 at Illinois State University in Normal.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: Mayor Dennis Tyler is accused of accepting a $5,000 bribe in exchange for what federal authorities said was “steering lucrative excavation work to a local contractor.” The 76-year-old Tyler was indicted last Wednesday by a U.S. District Court jury on a count of theft of public funds. The indictment was then sealed, setting the stage for the mayor’s arrest by FBI agents Monday morning at his northside Muncie home. According to the indictment, Tyler received the cash from Tracy Barton, the Muncie Sanitary District’s superintendent of sewer maintenance and engineering, for “awarding of contracts under Tyler’s influence.” The charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence and $250,000 fine. Tyler appeared at an initial hearing Monday and was then released from custody. His trial is set for Jan. 21.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A jury has awarded $1.4million to a Burmese immigrant who wanted a circumcision but instead got a vasectomy. The jury leveled a $2 million judgment against Dr. Kevin Birusingh, who performed the vasectomy. But jurors decided the man who filed the lawsuit, Zaw Zaw, was 30% responsible. Zaw is a 41-year-old refugee from Myanmar. He sued in November 2017, nearly two years after the errant procedure. Birusingh’s attorney says Zaw, who is not fluent in English, signed two informed consents that were translated into Burmese and completed four consultations before undergoing the procedure. The lawsuit says there’s no word for “vasectomy” in Burmese. Zaw’s attorney, Marc Harding, says a doctor’s referral documents showed Zaw was seeking a circumcision.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Authorities discovered a camel, a cow and a donkey roaming together along a road in a grouping reminiscent of a Midwestern Christmas Nativity scene. The Goddard Police Department asked for help Sunday in locating the owners of the “three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star).” Police said in a Facebook post that if they couldn’t find the owners, they would be “halfway toward a live Nativity this Christmas season.” Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Lt. Tim Meyers says the animals belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. One person who replied to the Facebook post inquired, “Are there 3 wise looking men near?” Another speculated that they “may lead you to the Second Coming.” Goddard is about 15 miles west of Wichita.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The University of Kentucky’s Appalachian Center is hosting a student-led series of events designed to bring awareness to water issues in eastern Kentucky and beyond. The events running through Thursday focus on ecology, infrastructure and bottled water, and they highlight organizations working on water-related issues. The Appalachian Center is based in the university’s College of Arts and Sciences. Among the events include a Tuesday screening of the film “Water Stories: Martin County,” followed by a panel discussion in the William T. Young Library UK Athletics Auditorium. The speakers will include water activists and Martin County residents Nina and Mickey McCoy. Other speakers include Ricki Draper, a community engagement coordinator and Madison Mooney, a master’s student in the UK College of Social Work.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Extensive Army training will close two wildlife management areas near Fort Polk to hunters over the Thanksgiving weekend. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release that the Fort Polk-Vernon and Peason Ridge Wildlife Management Areas will be closed to hunting from Nov. 29 through Dec. 1. The Fort Polk-Vernon WMA is in central Vernon Parish near Leesville. Peason Ridge is in northern Vernon Parish, southeastern Sabine Parish and southwestern Natchitoches Parish near Simpson. The department notes that deer hunts will remain open in the Kisatchie National Forest and three other wildlife management areas in the region: Clear Creek near Leesville, West Bay in Allen Parish near Oakdale, and Sabine, in Sabine Parish, near Many.\n\nMaine\n\nFarmington: There’s support for changing the University of Southern Maine’s name to the University of Maine at Portland. The vote Monday by the University of Maine System trustees in Farmington authorizes the system’s leadership to seek approval from the Legislature for the name change. Chairman James Erwin said the change would clarify the university’s identity and improve its marketability. The name change initiative was launched a year ago as a means to attract out-of-state students. Market research showed that out-of-staters don’t know where USM is located and that placing “Portland” in the name would increase interest.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Museum of Art will only add artwork created by women to its permanent collection in 2020. Museum director Christopher Bedford announced the policy Thursday, saying something radical must be done to rectify centuries of imbalance. The museum acquired its first work by a female artist in 1916, just two years after it was founded and several years before women gained the right to vote. Today, only 4% of the 95,000 pieces in its permanent collection were created by women. News outlets report each of the museum’s exhibits will be strongly tied to women. Nineteen will showcase art solely by women, including at least one of whom is transgender. Bedford says the museum is working to “correct our own canon” and address historical blind spots.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Senate is preparing to debate a bill to create a ban on all carry-out plastic bags at checkout from retail stores. The bill would require retailers to charge at least 10 cents for a recycled paper bag. Five cents would go to the city or town for enforcement of the ban. The remainder would go to the retailer to cover the cost of the paper bags. More than 100 Massachusetts communities have already passed plastic bag bans. Democratic Sen. President Karen Spilka said she took a personal interest in the ban after a family trip this summer to Vancouver and Alaska, where she learned sea animals can starve to death because of the amount of plastic in their stomachs. The Senate will debate the bill Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city’s Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity office is partnering with the owners of a downtown tavern and a Detroit resident on a discussion about racial issues. The city says “Let’s Talk About Race” will be held Thursday at the Checker Bar. It follows the firing of a white Checker Bar employee because of mistreatment of a black patron over his race. Organizers say the discussion will fuel a needed dialogue aimed at the history and roots of racial discrimination in the city, with a goal of building bridges between communities and “champions against racial discrimination.” Checker Bar owner Tim Tharpe says the incident has provided “an outstanding opportunity to have a deeper, more meaningful conversation to make Detroit’s business community even more inclusive.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: County officials say they will pay for additional help to examine about 1,700 rape kits that have never been tested, some of which date back 30 years. The city announced Friday that it discovered the untested kits in July when the department was doing an inventory. Deputy Police Chief Erick Fors estimates it will likely take two years to get them tested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says the county will fund an additional DNA analyst position at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to help speed up the process. Freeman says victims who have questions should contact Vernona Boswell, the county’s sexual assault victim advocate. The number revealed Friday is nearly nine times more than the 194 untested kits the city disclosed it had in 2015.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Enrollment is down at the University of Mississippi for the third straight year. The Oxford Eagle reports 2019 enrollment numbers for all six Ole Miss campuses show a 3.5% decrease from 2018. That’s the highest percentage drop over the past three years. Numbers released by the Institute of Higher Learning show the system now has 22,273 students, which is a decline of 817 people from last year. Chancellor Glenn Boyce says recruiting students is tough nationally, and the university is working to improve through investments in technology, marketing and recruiting. Statistics show enrollment at rival Mississippi State University rose slightly, increasing by 1.1% to 22,226 students. Enrollment is down overall at Mississippi universities, declining 1.6% from last year to a total of 29,193 students.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials are stepping up enforcement of laws that ban selling vaping products to minors. The move is part of a state campaign launched Monday to deter young people from vaping. Missouri’s health department so far has reported two vaping-related deaths. Alcohol and Tobacco Control agents are prioritizing inspections at stores that sell vaping products. The division’s state supervisor, Dottie Taylor, says about 83% of stores are currently checking identification cards and refusing sales to minors. State officials are also using YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat to warn teenagers about the risks of vaping. Gov. Mike Parson says it’s up to lawmakers to consider whether to restrict flavored electronic cigarettes when they return to the Capitol in January. Parson didn’t say whether he’d support such a ban when asked Monday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Environmental regulators have put a halt to a business association’s sale of sandwich bags of mining waste advertised as a “Bag O’Slag.” Environmental Protection Agency officials overseeing the Superfund cleanup of pollution from decades of smelter operations in Anaconda came across the potentially toxic tchotchkes for sale by the city’s chamber of commerce. The slag contains small amounts of arsenic and lead. Mary Johnston, the chamber’s executive director, said Monday that the EPA asked the group to stop selling the black slag in a resealable bag and gave it some alternatives. Anaconda’s golf course, which has slag in its sand traps, offers slag and a golf ball in a sealed container as a souvenir. Johnston says the chamber sold up to 40 bags a summer for $2 apiece.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Trees around the perimeter of Zorinsky Lake Park will be cut down over the next few years as a result of a directive from Washington. The 30-foot corridor is expected to total about 40 acres of trees, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The plan by the Army Corps of Engineers has angered some property owners, while others welcome it. The federal government owns the land where the lake, built for flood control, is situated. The City of Omaha operates and maintains the park. The trees are being removed to better delineate the park’s boundaries. A number of homeowners around the lake say they are stunned by the decision. The loss of trees around the park will irreparably harm their views, they say, as well as lower their property values, damage habitat and alter the natural qualities of a park that the public has come to love.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal government wants a judge to reject the state’s request for a court order to remove weapons-grade plutonium from a site north of Las Vegas, arguing that officials have promised no more material will be shipped to the state. In documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Reno, the federal government brands as “conjectural” or “hypothetical” state claims that residents are harmed by radiation from the one-half metric ton of plutonium secretly trucked a year ago from South Carolina to Nevada. The decision cannot be undone, the material is already in the state, and the federal government has sovereign immunity, meaning the state can’t force the federal government to act, the motion contends. The Department of Energy “routinely and safely transports nuclear materials into and out of Nevada and stores classified amounts of plutonium in Nevada,” it says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The quadrennial chaos has quieted down over at the New Hampshire secretary of state’s office with the closing of the filing period for the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Between Oct. 30 and Friday, a total of 50 candidates signed paperwork and paid $1,000 each to get their names on the 2020 ballot – 33 Democrats and 17 Republicans. That’s compared to the 42 names voters saw 100 years ago, the first time New Hampshire held the nation’s earliest primary. Back then, voters selected delegates to the nominating conventions, rather than voting for the candidates themselves. For the 2016 election, 58 candidates got on New Hampshire’s ballot. The all-time high for candidates came in 1992, when 61 signed up.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After nearly two years of back-and-forth over legalizing marijuana, legislative leaders announced Monday that legal weed is heading to the polls, setting up a pivotal ballot question in the 2020 election. If voters approve the bill, New Jersey would become the 12th state to legalize marijuana for adult use. All but two other states – Vermont and Illinois – have legalized weed via ballot measures. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, introduced a constitutional amendment that he expects to appear on the ballot in the 2020 election. Sweeney and Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored the original New Jersey legal weed bill, said they simply couldn’t find enough support in the Senate to get a marijuana legalization law passed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A ceremonial Native American shield has been welcomed back by tribal leaders, in the culmination of a years­long international campaign to reclaim the sacred object that held a place in a cycle of ceremonies until it vanished from a mesa-top indigenous village in the 1970s. Nearly four years ago, the shield surfaced as an auction item in Paris, prompting tribal leaders to begin making public appeals for it to be pulled from bidding and returned to them. U.S. and Acoma Pueblo officials announced Monday that an FBI agent delivered the shield from Paris last week following a multiagency effort that involved U.S. senators, diplomats and prosecutors. It will be formally returned to Acoma Pueblo after a judge dismisses a civil forfeiture case that prosecutors filed to secure the shield’s return, U.S. Attorney John Anderson said. “It will be a day of high emotion and thanksgiving,” Acoma Pueblo Gov. Brian Vallo said ahead of the expected return.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Reports of racism at Syracuse University have resulted in a student sit-in that was in its sixth day Monday, a suspension of fraternity events and an offer of as much as $50,000 in reward money. Administrators on Sunday suspended one fraternity, along with social events for the others, after the latest report the night before. An African American student filed a complaint saying she was verbally harassed by people identified as members and guests of the suspended fraternity. The slurs followed several unsolved discoveries of graffiti and vandalism in recent weeks that administrators say have targeted Jews, Asians and black students. State agencies have joined the investigation. Students have staged a protest at the campus wellness center since Nov. 13 to demand stronger diversity programming.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper has signed into law bills designed to help his cash-strapped Department of Transportation and the continued recovery from hurricanes Florence, Matthew and Dorian. Cooper on Monday signed the measures, the last pieces of legislation on his desk from the General Assembly session that ended Friday. The Legislature reconvenes in mid-January. DOT’s cash balance had fallen due to unprecedented hurricane repairs, legal settlements over rights of way and project overruns. The bill directs $100 million to the agency for past and natural disasters, forgives a $90 million loan and allows an extra $100 million in road-building bonds. A separate disaster-relief law locates $180 million in state funds, most of which would meet federal matching requirements and create a Dorian state recovery program for displaced residents.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The U.S. Bureau of Prisons says an inmate walked away from a Fargo facility, and his whereabouts are unknown. Authorities say 30-year-old Juan Francisco Martinez walked away from Centre Inc. early Sunday morning. Authorities say he was serving a federal sentence for a 2015 conviction of felon in possession of a firearm. Martinez was transferred from Lee United States Prison in Virginia to Fargo in August to serve the remainder of his sentence. He was due for release in February. Center Inc.’s website says it is a “private nonprofit agency that provides rehabilitative services to individuals to achieve social re-integration.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two ride-share companies are urging the state to resume requiring front license plates. Uber and Lyft submitted letters last week to Republican Senate President Larry Obhof in support of legislation that would again make it mandatory for Ohio drivers to affix license plates to both the front and back of their vehicles. The companies cite safety concerns. Both urge their riders to confirm the license plate number on a phone app before entering a ride-share vehicle. A 21-year-old University of South Carolina student was murdered earlier this year by the driver of a car she mistakenly thought was an Uber vehicle. A provision removing Ohio’s front plate requirement was included in the state transportation budget passed earlier this year. It is set to take effect in July.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State veterinary officials say a horse at Remington Park has been euthanized after testing positive for equine herpesvirus-1. Assistant state veterinarian Dr. Michael Herrin said Friday that the horse was euthanized last Tuesday, and the barn where it was housed is under quarantine for 14 days. All horses remaining in the quarantined barn will remain there and will be monitored daily for symptoms of EHV-1, which include fever, a lack of coordination, and weakness or paralysis of the legs. The disease is not transmitted to humans but is highly contagious to horses and is generally spread through coughing and sneezing.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Oregon State University will use a $3.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study pollution from tiny plastics and its impact on aquatic life. The university said Monday that scientists will develop tools and methods for evaluating micro- and nanoplastics in everything from the ocean to estuaries. Research will focus on the impact of tiny plastics on an estuary fish called the inland silversides and on oyster larvae off the Oregon coast. Another goal of the project is establishing a Pacific Northwest Consortium on Plastics – to include government agencies, non-governmental organizations and grassroots groups – to encourage the reduction of marine pollution. Results of OSU’s plastics research will be displayed at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland the future.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania State University’s president says he is working to counter difficult national and state enrollment trends that could put pressure on even a financially healthy school like Penn State. President Eric Barron says almost every county in Pennsylvania has seen a decline in the number of high school graduates, and those graduates are less likely to go to college. To fight those trends, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports Barron told trustees Friday that the university has created a task force to focus on recruiting international students, including from areas such as South America and Africa. Penn State also is sending admission staff to recruit in growing areas domestically, including California, Florida and Texas. However, Barron says the university will keep its commitment to a majority enrollment of Pennsylvania residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., says a land trust in the state has been awarded $600,000 in federal funding to help beginning farmers. Reed says the Southside Community Land Trust won a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to help beginning farmers access resources and training. Reed toured the land trust’s 50-acre Urban Edge Farm bordering Cranston and Johnston last Tuesday. It serves as a hub for small-scale, environmentally sustainable commercial agriculture. Thirteen farmers operate at Urban Edge. New farmers are invited there to learn how to raise and market crops. Reed says the grant helps “plant the seeds for future success.” The land trust says it has used federal funding to help 27 people begin farming and to train another 79 beginning farmers in the past three years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state says more than half a million loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings have made it to the sea during a record-breaking year, despite losses during Hurricane Dorian. The Post and Courier reports that preliminary data from the state Natural Resources Department counts about 525,500 turtles that emerged from their nests. The previous record was set in 2016, when eggshell counts showed about 396,400 turtles emerged. This year’s numbers are still being verified. Though the department says all sea turtle species found in South Carolina are threatened, the newspaper says state, federal and citizen efforts dating back to the 1970s could be reversing the once gradual decline. Hundreds of volunteers help mark and monitor the nests through a recovery program, along with biologists who relocate and cage in endangered nests.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A university researcher says it might someday be necessary to pipe Missouri River water to the city. The Rapid City Journal reports Kurt Katzenstein presented his findings to the West Dakota Water Development District last week. Katzenstein is an associate professor of geology and geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology. He says the 171-mile pipeline could cost up to $1.87 billion, making it a long-term idea that could require funding from Congress. Katzenstein says projections indicate the Rapid City area could have enough water from local sources to sustainably meet demand for the next 100 years if average precipitation levels prevail. But he says the day will come when local water supplies are insufficient.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s education commissioner says the new school vouchers for private education will be considered federally taxable income for parents. After confirming the requirement to lawmakers Monday, Commissioner Penny Schwinn told reporters the Board of Education, attorney general’s office and program rulemaking officials helped make the determination. Schwinn said officials will have to examine the taxable income of families as a result, given income limits to receive vouchers worth up to $7,300 annually. Participating families cannot exceed twice the federal income eligibility for free school lunch. The law says the vouchers “do not constitute income of a parent of a participating student” under Tennessee law. That doesn’t affect federal taxes. Gov. Bill Lee’s administration is hoping to begin the program next year. It’s limited to Shelby and Davidson counties.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: More than 1,000 people have attended a memorial to honor the 12 people who died when a tower of logs collapsed at Texas A&M University 20 years ago. The Eagle reports that the ceremony Monday at the university’s Bonfire Memorial featured performances of “Spirit of Aggieland,” “Amazing Grace” and “The Aggie War Hymn.” Eleven university students and one former student died Nov. 18, 1999, when a 40-foot bonfire structure holding about 5,000 logs collapsed. Twenty-seven other students were injured. Janice Kerlee, the mother of a student who died, said those who died were “extraordinary young people” known for their smiles and love for people. Texas A&M President Michael K. Young says he hopes Monday’s ceremony brings solace to the loved ones of those who died.\n\nUtah\n\nEagle Mountain: A high school student who lost both her parents to heart attacks has been nominated for a prestigious scholarship on the strength of her idea for a CPR assistance device. The Daily Herald reports Kennedy Hall’s idea is to create a device that fits over the nose and mouth and creates artificial breaths for a person. Hall says many people have a basic idea of how to give CPR but don’t know exactly how to do it. She says a machine like she’s envisioning might have helped her parents. Hall, a senior at Cedar Valley High School in Eagle Mountain, was chosen as the school’s nominee for the Career and Technical Education Presidential Scholarship Award. She says she hopes to attend Utah State University and become a trauma surgeon.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Cross country skiers in the area will have a new warming hut available for use this winter. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the warming hut that was built at the Windham Regional Career Center was brought to the Brattleboro Country Club just in time for the 2019-20 ski season. For years skiers used a structure at the country club, but it’s no longer available. So the country club offered the Brattleboro Outing Club another location for a warming hut. The outing club bought the 14-by-36-foot unfinished tiny house built by the Construction Trades Program. Over the past several months, the foundation was built, and the club won regulatory approval for the hut.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials say the number of fatal overdoses from methamphetamine use in the state has risen over the past three years. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Chief Medical Examiner says deadly meth overdoses rose from 88 people in 2017 to 127 people in 2018. The office projects 150 people will die of a meth overdose this year. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Washington Division spokeswoman Katherine Hayek says meth from Mexico brought into the U.S. is cheap and of high quality, which is a part of the problem. She also says fentanyl is sometimes mixed into meth and cocaine. Numbers from the Virginia Department of Health say almost half of meth overdose deaths in the state last year had fentanyl causing or contributing to death.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Children’s Hospital says 10 of its operating rooms will now remain closed through January to deal with an Aspergillus mold outbreak. KOMO reports the hospital says it will immediately install what it called custom in-room HEPA filtration in those 10 operating rooms and two equipment storage rooms. The installation was scheduled to be complete by July, but the hospital says it will now be fully installed by the end of January. The latest discovery marks the second time the fungus has been detected in operating rooms at Seattle Children’s Hospital. The previous outbreak led to at least five infections and one death, hospital officials said at the time. It is still not clear what caused the mold to resurface this time, but an investigation is underway by the hospital and its regulator, the State Department of Health.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: Members of the Polish Territorial Defense Forces have been training with the West Virginia National Guard and Special Forces near Elkins. The Inter-Mountain reports the Polish troops were participating in the Guard’s Ridge Runner program, which focuses on irregular warfare. Olga Krawcyzk-Majeran, the public affairs officer for the exercise, tells the paper a group of more than 100 Polish troops arrived for training Nov. 1. She says it is the third trip to West Virginia for Territorial Defense Forces troops. The TDF was established in 2017 and includes more than 22,000 soldiers. Its role is similar to that of the National Guard, supporting local communities and serving as the reserve base for other Polish forces.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHartland: A girl with an inoperable brain tumor who received tens of thousands of pictures of her favorite animal from strangers has died at age 8. Emma Mertens loved dogs. So after she was diagnosed in January, family and friends sent photos of their dogs to the Hartland girl. And after some social media posts, the photos, letters and gifts from around the world started pouring in to Emma. In March, 40 police dogs and their handlers from around Wisconsin paid a special visit to Emma at her home. Emma’s parents asked well-wishers to support her foundation at emmalovesdogs.org, and in September it made its first gift – a protective vest for the Racine County Sheriff’s Department K-9 officer, Stax. Her family says Emma died Sunday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State and tribal officials are working to ensure Native Americans are accurately counted in the 2020 census. The Casper Star-Tribune reports advocates and officials are consulting with tribal leaders and planning an advertising campaign to attract attention to the U.S. Census Bureau’s canvassing efforts. Officials say they hope the outreach leads to a more accurate count of Native American residents in Wyoming, who are believed to have been under-counted in the past. Census data says 2.7% of Wyoming’s population identifies as Native American. The figures indicate about 27,000 people live on the Wind River Reservation west of Casper and off-reservation trust land, with about 7,800 identifying as Native American. The Census Bureau says American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations were undercounted by nearly 5% in 2010.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/10/molly-denali-saloon-discourse-ashes-mail-news-around-states/39670063/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCarbon Hill: Two city leaders have resigned after their mayor posted a comment on Facebook about “killing out” socialists, “baby killers,” and gay and transgender people. But Mayor Mark Chambers refused to step down and told residents he plans to run for re-election. Protesters staged a die-in and then confronted Chambers at a meeting Monday, where he sat between two empty chairs. Some asked just how he’d like to kill them. One carried a sign saying, “If you kill me, my ghost will haunt you.” The meeting soon ended, with Chambers walking out past people calling for him to resign. He met privately beforehand with a small group of protesters. Resident Rawsy McCollum says the mayor apologized and said his comments shouldn’t have been public. But McCollum says he shouldn’t have voiced hatred at all, and it’s time for him to go.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Natives are sharing their world with a general audience in the nation’s first-ever children’s series featuring indigenous leads. “Molly of Denali” premieres Monday on PBS Kids. The animated show highlights the adventures of a 10-year-old Athabascan girl, Molly Mabray. Her family owns the Denali Trading Post in the fictitious community of Qyah, which has a diverse population. Native Americans voice the indigenous characters. The series is co-produced by Boston-based WGBH and animation partner Atomic Cartoons in collaboration with Alaska Native advisers and script writers. The 30-minute show will run mornings seven days a week. WGBH executive producer Dorothea Gillim says PBS ordered 38 half-hour episodes besides the hourlong premiere. Each episode also includes a short video featuring real Alaska Native children living life in the vast state.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: Dozens of city employees in this Phoenix suburb will use self-driving vehicles at work in partnership with Waymo, an autonomous vehicle company. The partnership will begin this month as Chandler evaluates whether using the autonomous vehicles cuts costs to maintain and operate its vehicles and makes employees more productive. Officials say the program will last at least a year. Chandler has been a leader on testing autonomous vehicles in metro Phoenix. Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project, has been testing its autonomous vehicles in the area since 2016. The partnership will let employees use the Waymo app to schedule rides to work meetings within the company’s service area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will visit the city later this year as part of a lecture series put on by the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton School of Public Service. Ginsburg became the second female justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993 after then-President Bill Clinton nominated her to the post. She’s to speak Sept. 3 on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Ginsburg missed six days of arguments last term as she recovered from surgery for lung cancer, but she returned to the bench in February. In March, fans marked her 86th birthday by wearing workout gear and exercising in front of the high court in a nod to Ginsburg’s well-known workout routine. The Little Rock event is open to the public.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state Senate on Monday sent legislation to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk that will spend $130 million a year over the next decade to improve drinking water for about a million people. Roughly 1 million of California’s nearly 40 million residents don’t have access to clean drinking water because of pollution from humans or natural causes, a fact state lawmakers have called an embarrassment for a state with the fifth-largest economy in the world. The problem is statewide, but it is concentrated in the Central Valley – the capital of the state’s $20 billion agriculture industry. Senators approved the measure 38-1. Newsom had proposed a tax on most residential water bills to address the problem. But state lawmakers were wary of approving a new tax in a year when they had an estimated $21.5 billion surplus. Instead, on Monday the state Senate approved a bill that would authorize spending up to $130 million each year on the state’s distressed water districts, with most of it coming from a fund aimed at fighting climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A giraffe herd at a local zoo has welcomed its 16th member following the birth of a calf. The 10-year-old reticulated giraffe named Msitu gave birth Saturday at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The zoo says the calf was about 6 feet tall at birth and weighed more than 150 pounds. Zoo officials say the mother and calf appear to be doing well. The sex of the calf has not yet been confirmed. The zoo waits 30 days before naming babies. Pregnancies for reticulated giraffes can last up to 15 months. The calf is Msitu’s third. She gave birth to Emy in 2013 and to Rae in 2017. Emy lives at a zoo in Peoria, Illinois. Rae remains with the Colorado Springs herd.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwalk: A federal judge has cleared the way for state and federal transportation officials to move forward with a $1.1 billion replacement of a 122-year-old movable railroad bridge in the city. U.S. District Court Judge Stefan Underhill ruled Monday against opponents who had filed a lawsuit that argued there are cheaper alternatives for replacing the Walk Bridge. The Norwalk Harbor Keeper and others say that unlike a century ago, few boats with tall masts currently pass in and out of the Norwalk River. They had suggested replacing the bridge with a fixed bridge that would save taxpayers money and cause less disruption to the environment. In his ruling, Underhill said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. He also found the government made its decision properly after considering other options.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Leo E. Strine Jr., the state’s witty and sometimes controversial Supreme Court chief justice, is stepping down from the bench with about half his term remaining. Strine delivered his resignation letter to Gov. John Carney on Monday, saying he plans to retire in the fall. A press release from the governor’s office did not detail Strine’s reasons, and the chief justice’s spokesman said he is on vacation and not available for comment. During his tenure, the court invalidated the state’s death penalty, ruled on controversial land use issues and weighed in on billion-dollar business disputes. His stepping down begins a process in which Carney will nominate his successor, a dance that will be watched closely by legal and corporate circles around the world given Delaware’s prominence in business.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Zoo says the first documented Asian water dragon to be born from the DNA of a single parent has died. The Washington Post reports the zoo says the 2-year-old female lizard died from blood cancer in mid-June. The lizard was born in 2016 through a process known as facultative parthenogenesis, which is when female creatures that can produce sexually instead produce offspring on their own. The lizard was hospitalized after workers found it struggling to breathe. It was later found dead. The zoo says water dragons are native to Southeast Asia and have a life expectancy of up to 15 years. They’re named after their defensive strategy that involves submerging themselves in water and holding their breath for up to 25 minutes.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Voting rights advocates have filed suit against the Florida secretary of state over a new law they say makes it impossible to hold early voting on college campuses. They argue that the law disenfranchises young voters. The measure requires early voting locations to have “sufficient non-permitted parking,” which critics say would virtually ban sites on colleges campuses because of their restrictive parking rules. It was part of a broader voting bill signed into law last month by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The lawsuit against Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee. Lee did not have a direct hand in drafting the law but would have to enforce it. The plaintiffs include the League of Women Voters and eight young voters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Scientists are learning more about suicides among the state’s farmers – and they say the aftermath of Hurricane Michael could bring more risks to rural areas. New research shows that relationship issues, health-related problems and financial hardship are among the most common factors. A University of Georgia researcher believes Hurricane Michael could pose an additional threat to Georgia’s farming community. Anna Scheyett, dean of the University of Georgia School of Social Work, says farmers are very resilient – but they’re also vulnerable and need support. WABE Radio reports that Scheyett examined 106 cases of suicide among farmers and agriculture workers, which were recorded in the Georgia Violent Death Reporting System from 2008 to 2015.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A large missile defense radar mounted on a modified floating oil platform has returned to the state. Missile Defense Agency spokeswoman Maria Njoku told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the radar is back at Pearl Harbor for regular maintenance and installation of system upgrades. She says shore personnel will conduct inspections and surveys, and crew members will receive training. The Missile Defense Agency plans to keep the $2 billion Sea-Based X-Band Radar at sea for more than 300 days in the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to “address the continued missile test activity in North Korea.” The agency plans to have the radar spend 330 days at sea each year between 2021 and 2024. The military is planning to build a series of land-based sensors that will also track ballistic missiles.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups say a U.S. Forest Service plan to improve wildlife habitat in eastern Idaho will do the opposite and takes an illegal shortcut around environmental laws. Alliance for the Wild Rockies and two other groups filed a lawsuit in federal court last week seeking to halt the Rowley Canyon Wildlife Enhancement Project in Bannock County. The Forest Service in June approved the project that would remove more than half of the juniper trees on about 1,300 acres and remove shrubs on another 400 acres. Federal officials say that will improve habitat for deer, elk and grouse. The environmental groups say it instead will allow cheatgrass and other invasive plants to move in and destroy good habitat.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum Society is offering day trips for people to explore the state’s history and culture this summer by coach bus. The first trip, scheduled Aug. 10, will feature a visit to the Illinois State Museum Lockport Gallery and a 90-minute walking tour of the Old Joliet Prison. The facility was Illinois’ second state prison and operated from 1858 to 2002. It was famously featured in the movie “The Blues Brothers.” The second trip, Sept. 14, will focus on African American history. The first stop will be in New Philadelphia, the site of the first town platted and registered by an African American. The group will then visit the Huck Finn Freedom Center in Hannibal, Missouri. Trips range in cost from $114 to $149.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Tiles with images of swastikas that were installed more than a century ago have been removed from the walls inside an Indiana University building. The school says the tiles at the Indiana University School of Public Health classroom building were installed before the swastika was adopted as the symbol of the Nazi Party. They’re among tiles that include symbols from different cultures. The (Bloomington) Herald-Times reports an explanation of the symbol’s history was posted near the tiles for many years, but some still found the tiles offensive. The school says the swastika tiles will be sanded to remove the symbol and remounted. The tiles were installed during the construction of the original IU Men’s Gymnasium in 1917. It’s now part of the IU School of Public Health classroom building.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A southwest Iowa man has won his free speech legal battle with a sheriff’s department and two officers who charged him with harassment for writing a social media post that profanely criticized a deputy. The Adams County Sheriff’s Office will pay Jon Richard Goldsmith $10,000 to settle a federal lawsuit he filed in May alleging violations of his free speech rights, retaliation and false arrest. The sheriff’s office agreed to a court order filed Monday that prohibits it from bringing criminal charges against or threatening to criminally charge citizens on the basis of the lawful comments, posts or other speech protected by the First Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa represented Goldsmith in the lawsuit against Adams County, Deputy Cory Dorsey and his supervisor.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A violent crime rate about twice the national average has prompted city law enforcement officials to join a national program that aims to drive down crime. The Wichita Eagle reports the city is among 10 selected this year to participate in the U.S. Department of Justice National Safety Partnership. Wichita cited the latest figures published by the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation in its application for the program. Shootings have climbed steadily since 2014. Murders, rapes and aggravated assaults all ticked up between 2016 and 2018. And domestic violence now accounts for nearly half of all aggravated assaults reported in the city. The partnership will provide training and technical assistance to the department at no cost.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city is ramping up the horseplay with a simple message to prospective visitors: Won’t you be my neighhhbor? As part of an ad campaign, VisitLEX, Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau, dressed up a horse as Fred Rogers, the writer and host of preschool television series “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” The star of the campaign is Hank, a 21-year-old horse from the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington. Hank’s outfit was designed by Lexington-based fashion designer Soreyda Benedit Begley. Coincidentally, the horse’s name almost matches that of Tom Hanks, who will portray Rogers in the upcoming film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” set to be released in November. Lexington, surrounded by more than 400 horse farms, claims to be the horse capital of the world.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCovington: A dispute is developing over whether a hotel and conference center should be developed at a state park. A study paid for by the St. Tammany Parish Tourist and Convention Commission says the project should be built at Fontainebleau State Park near Mandeville. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that the proposed lodge and conference center would offer views of Lake Pontchartrain. It is projected to generate $1.8 million in cash flow in 2021, its first year. That’s projected to grow to nearly $2.3 million by 2025. Critics of the plan say it will draw commerce away from existing businesses in Slidell and Covington. They also question the need for more revenue at a park that they said brings in $1.3 million a year, with expenses of $1.2 million.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A new state law is designed to prevent young children from being suspended or expelled from schools. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed “An Act to Promote Social and Emotional Learning and Development for Young Children” into law. The proposal by Democratic Sen. Cathy Breen of Falmouth is intended to cut down on suspension and expulsion rates by providing a consultation program for teachers and parents of young children. Senate Democrats say the proposal will create a voluntary program that makes consultants with advanced training in mental health and child development available to help “contain the impact of challenging behaviors in the classroom.” The Democrats say Maine has the second-highest rate of preschool student expulsion in the country, and that causes disruptions in the education of the children.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An area in the state that’s home to abandoned World War I-era steamships has been designated a new national marine sanctuary. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the state of Maryland and Charles County announced the Mallows Bay-Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary on Monday. It contains more than 100 abandoned steamships and vessels that were built as part of the nation’s engagement in World War I. It’s about 40 miles south of Washington, D.C., along an 18-mile stretch of Potomac River coast in Charles County. Maryland nominated the area for sanctuary designation in 2014 to conserve the shipwrecks and increase opportunities for public access, tourism and economic development. The sanctuary designation will take effect following 45 days of congressional session after publication of the action in the Federal Register.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A replica of the Mayflower will be sailing to the city as part of commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in Massachusetts. Organizers say the Mayflower II will be on display at the Charlestown Navy Yard from May 14 to May 19, 2020, and visitors will have an opportunity to board the ship for free. The vessel has been undergoing a $7.5 million restoration at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut since 2016. The original Mayflower was lost to history after returning to England following its famous 1620 voyage to the New World. The full-scape replica ship was built in England in the 1950s and has been berthed in Plymouth Harbor. Plans are to bring it back to Plymouth following the Mayflower Sails 2020 event.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The governor has signed legislation honoring the late Queen of Soul with a highway designation. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday approved the bill to designate a portion of M-10 in Detroit as the “Aretha L. Franklin Memorial Highway.” Franklin died in the city last year after battling pancreatic cancer. Whitmer, a Democrat, noted in a statement that Franklin’s “creativity and voice contributed to our musical and cultural history in Michigan.” Supporters of the designation say dedicating a portion of the highway is a way to honor the musical and cultural icon, who grew up in Detroit and learned the gospel fundamentals at New Bethel Baptist Church. Some Republicans who opposed the bill, however, have said such designations should only go to fallen first responders and military veterans.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two University of Minnesota students are launching a prescription drug repository program to redistribute unused medications to people who are struggling to pay for their medicine. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that pharmacy students Rowan Mahon and Hannah Van Ochten were behind the bill to set up the repository, which will begin next year. Gov. Tim Walz approved a state health budget that included the measure this spring. The new law allows care facilities to send unused pills to a central repository, where they’ll undergo safety checks. Mahon says the medicine can’t be expired or show signs of tampering. Once cleared for use, the drugs can be distributed at reduced prices for people in need. Mahon is applying for grants and fundraising to get the program off the ground.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Toxic bacteria are keeping swimmers out of the water on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, and it will be weeks before financial information shows whether beach closures are hurting the local economy. The communications director for the tourism agency Coastal Mississippi, Erin Rosetti, says she’s seeing fewer people hanging out on the sand. “We do see people on the beach. However, we don’t see them en masse as we are used to during this month,” Rosetti said Monday. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality is warning that people and pets should stay out of saltwater near the mainland beaches. The agency started closing some beaches June 22 and on Sunday closed the last two sections near the Alabama line. While the water is off limits, people can still be on the sand.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Officials say a letter filled with a white, granular substance that spurred an evacuation contained human ashes. St. Joseph spokeswoman Mary Robertson said the city finance department evacuated Monday after a staffer opened the letter and saw a bag filled with a white substance inside. The envelope was addressed to the mayor and had been cut open and re-taped shut. Robertson says once emergency officials were able to safely open the envelope, they found a letter explaining that it contained the ashes of a former resident who died last year and had wanted her ashes to be spread around City Hall. Hazmat officials confirmed the substance was human ashes. Robertson says she’s not sure if the ashes will be spread at City Hall.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: In their quest to develop an improved computer that could one day be used in NASA spacecraft, Montana State University researchers have tinkered with their creation on the laboratory bench, dangled it from high-altitude helium balloons, sent it to the International Space Station and launched it into Earth’s orbit on a bread loaf-sized satellite. Now it will go to the moon. NASA announced that an MSU team led by Brock LaMeres has won a coveted spot on a 2020-2021 lunar mission that will be the biggest trial yet for the radiation-tolerant computing concept LaMeres conceived more than a decade ago. “Talk about a moonshot,” said LaMeres, professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering in MSU’s Norm Asbjornson College of Engineering. “The dream has always been to get (this technology, called RadPC) that far out into space.”\n\nNebraska\n\nDenton: The state Game and Parks Commission is inviting families to experience prairie wildlife and enjoy time together during a bioblitz scheduled for Saturday at Denton Prairie in southeast Nebraska. A bioblitz is an intense survey of species within a designated area. Attendees will count as many living things as possible in three hours, with teams looking for birds, insects, plants and more. The day will begin at 7 a.m. with a bird banding demonstration. Participants will begin looking for species about 9 a.m. and halt at noon. Water and snacks will be available; participants are encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Denton Prairie is a part of the Prairie Corridor on Haines Branch, a tallgrass prairie passage that connects Pioneers Park Nature Center to Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center.\n\nNevada\n\nEly: Federal officials say they plan to round up as many as 800 wild horses from vast range in eastern Nevada to reduce what land managers call damaging overpopulation. The Bureau of Land Management says the operation was scheduled to begin Tuesday in a public land study area known as the Triple B Complex. The complex covers about 2,500 square miles in the bureau’s Elko and Ely districts. A statement says helicopters will be used, the roundup should last less than four weeks, and the aim is to reduce the number of wild horses from an estimated 3,400 to about 2,600. The bureau says agents will escort public observers at pre-scheduled times, and captured horses will be checked by a veterinarian and offered for adoption or sale through a bureau program in Sparks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is increasing its efforts to serve its aging population. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu last week signed a bill to create a commission to advocate for elderly residents. The commission will replace a small committee within the Department of Health and Human Services that was composed mostly of volunteers. The new group will include representatives from seven state agencies and a full-time director. Doug McNutt of AARP New Hampshire told New Hampshire Public Radio the state needs to do a better job of adapting to issues affecting the aging population, including workforce issues and housing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, New Hampshire is the second-oldest state. Maine has the highest median age, with New Hampshire and Vermont right behind.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation aimed at helping first responders to the Sept. 11 attacks. The Democrat signed the bills Monday at Liberty State Park, across the Hudson River from the site of the 2001 attacks. One measure permits volunteer first responders to qualify for disability pensions when they retire. It’s aimed at helping those who were not on duty but who helped after the World Trade Center towers fell. A legislative estimate says it’s unclear how much the change would cost. It depends on how many retirees apply, and the estimate doesn’t specify a possible number. The other measure makes it easier for first responders to get workers compensation by removing the burden of proving the cause of an illness in certain cases.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWhite Oaks: A saloon in this ghost town attracts regulars with diverse backgrounds and opinions with a promise to “have dialogue.” The Albuquerque Journal reports the No Scum Allowed Saloon pulls in people from around the state and sometimes tourists from overseas because of its reputation and catchy name. Saloon owner Karen Haughness, one of nine people who live in White Oaks, says the saloon’s regulars often exceed the town’s population. She says the establishment cultivates civil discourse among visitors. The town was founded after gold was discovered in the region in 1879. Outlaw Billy the Kid is said to have visited White Oaks often looking for a good time. White Oaks is 160 miles southeast of Albuquerque.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A county clerk in western New York has filed a lawsuit challenging a new state law authorizing driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns filed the federal court challenge late Monday. The suit seeks a court injunction blocking the law while its constitutionality is reviewed by the court. The lawsuit names Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, as defendants. Kearns says the law forces county clerks to violate their oaths of office by granting licenses to immigrants who have broken immigration law. Supporters of the measure, which passed last month, say they expected a lawsuit and carefully crafted the law to withstand court scrutiny. Twelve states already have similar laws.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation designed to give prosecutors a new tool to convict drug dealers and to require public schools to teach more finance education is now law. The bills are among a dozen Gov. Roy Cooper said Monday that he’s signed into law. One bill makes it a felony to illegally sell drugs that result in an overdose death, punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Supporters say the “death by distribution” law will help fight the opioid epidemic, but critics say it will deter people from calling 911 during an overdose. Another new law requires high school students to pass a personal finance and economics class to graduate. Some teachers worry this will detract from other instruction, but supporters believe financial literacy is critical to real-world success.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials are looking for help collecting an insect that attacks an invasive plant. The state departments of Agriculture and Trust Lands as well as several county weed boards are trying to round up flea beetles and disperse them to feed on leafy spurge, one of North Dakota’s worst noxious weeds. They’ve been running collection days at different locations around the state since late June. The next scheduled day is Thursday along Franks Creek Road north of Fryburg in Billings County. Collection efforts are slated for 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Collectors should bring sweep nets and coolers with ice packs for transporting the beetles.\n\nOhio\n\nWapakoneta: This small city is shooting for the moon in celebrating its native son’s history-making walk 50 years ago this month. The hometown of Neil Armstrong has expanded its usual weekend “summer moon festival” to 10 days of Apollo 11 commemorations, starting this Friday. Tens of thousands of visitors – the biggest crowds here since Armstrong’s post-mission homecoming – are expected. There will be hot air balloons, ’60s-themed evenings, concerts, rocket launches and a visit from five other Ohio astronauts. And “the world’s largest moon pie,” all 50 pounds of it. Event planning began two years ago in this city of about 10,000 that has added nearly 3,000 residents since 1969 but retains that everybody-knows-everybody rural town feel.\n\nOklahoma\n\nKingfisher: No injuries or damage have been reported following several small earthquakes in central Oklahoma. The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 3.1 temblor was recorded at 9:44 a.m. Tuesday 7 miles west of Kingfisher, or about 35 miles west of Oklahoma City. The earthquake was recorded at a depth of 4 miles. Two other earthquakes, both magnitude 2.6, were recorded in the same area Tuesday. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state Senate committee has placed conditions by which Sen. Brian Boquist, R-Dallas, must abide if he enters the Capitol building, stemming from threats he made more than two weeks ago against the Senate president and Oregon State Police. Until a full investigation into his comments is complete, Boquist must give 12 hours advance notice to the secretary of the Senate before he intends to be in the Capitol. When he is in the building, State police will bolster their presence. The Senate Committee on Conduct also voted Monday to advise Boquist he cannot retaliate against anyone who raised concerns about safety because of his comments or anyone who is participating in the investigation. During a recent GOP walkout to protest a cap-and-trade bill, Boquist told state police to “send bachelors and come heavily armed” if they came after him.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nAltoona: A convenience store chain is putting Bitcoin ATMs in six shops around the state, giving customers the ability to buy and sell the cryptocurrency with U.S. dollars. Sheetz, based in Altoona, announced Tuesday that it has teamed up with Coinsource to put the ATMs in the five Pennsylvania stores and a shop in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Ryan Sheetz, a vice president at the company, says the family-owned chain is always trying to be innovative and give customers what they want. Customers must enroll with Coinsource before they can use the ATMs. Then they’ll be able to make transactions from $5 to $5,000 per day from the machines.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingston: State officials are telling visitors to a local pond to watch out for jellyfish. The Department of Health says five people have been treated in emergency rooms after being stung by jellyfish at Potter Pond in South Kingston. Experts say the type of creatures involved, known as clinging jellyfish, are small – about the size of a dime – but pack a powerful sting. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe pain and occasionally even respiratory or neurological problems. People wading in the pond are advised to wear protective clothing and take other precautions. Officials say clinging jellyfish typically attach themselves to underwater aquatic vegetation and algae and have been found in other ponds and estuaries. They are not typically found on ocean beaches.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Police say a woman stole a vehicle after throwing a snake at the driver, then crashed through barricades set up for a pole-vaulting exhibition. In a statement, Greenville Police identified the suspect as 29-year-old Hilmary Moreno-Berrios. They she was hurt in Friday’s crash and released from the hospital Monday. Authorities say Moreno-Berrios demanded a woman’s keys and threw a live black snake at her. They say she then drove the stolen SUV, with the snake still in it, into barriers set up for the Liberty Bridge Jump-Off. Moreno-Berrios is charged with carjacking, malicious damage to property and five traffic violations. It wasn’t known whether she had a lawyer to contact for comment on her behalf. Police say the snake wasn’t venomous and was released in nearby woods.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nFort Pierre: A new proposal would ban transporting deer and elk carcasses in some parts of the state to help slow the spread of chronic wasting disease. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to the most restrictive options presented to the commissioners for transporting mule deer, whitetail deer and elk carcasses into and around South Dakota. A final decision is expected in September. If approved, the restrictions would go into effect July 1, 2020. Chronic wasting disease has been found in free-ranging deer and elk in southwestern South Dakota. Staff urged the commission to adopt the most restrictive options to slow the disease’s spread to the rest of the state. CWD is a fatal disease that strikes the nervous system in deer, elk and moose.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Laura Mabel Francatelli survived the sinking of the Titanic wearing a life jacket she cherished for the rest of her long life. Now, for the first time in 107 years, Francatelli’s jacket is on public display. It’s one of six on exhibit through December at the Titanic Museum Attraction in Pigeon Forge. The six life jackets – two linked to surviving passengers and four others with sadder, less certain pasts – are half of the 12 known to still exist from the Titanic. “It’s very poignant,” says Paul Burns, the museum’s curator. “This was a tragedy for the survivors and the victims.” Francatelli’s life jacket was unveiled Tuesday in a ceremony at the museum. Musicians performed “Nearer My God to Thee” – the last song Titanic musicians played – to begin the event.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A borrowed ship has become the floating summer school home for more than 300 maritime students and staff from Texas A&M University at Galveston. The Galveston County Daily News the Golden Bear departed Saturday from the Port of Galveston as part of Sea Aggies training. The 500-foot vessel is normally operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. The Golden Bear set sail with about 260 members of the Corps of Cadets, plus 70 faculty and staff, for two months in the Gulf of Mexico and ocean experience. Daryn Taylor, a senior, says the voyage combines the stresses of college life and being on a working vessel in the open sea. Texas A&M has a smaller training ship, the General Rudder, which can accommodate 50 students.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Four famous paintings will be showcased in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts beginning this fall. The Smithsonian American Art Museum announced Monday that Utah is one of five states in the West selected to host works from American painter Georgia O’Keeffe and others as part of a new initiative to share art with smaller cities throughout the United States. From Oct. 25 until Oct. 4, 2020 visitors can view paintings from O’Keeffe and fellow American painters Thomas Moran and Alma Thomas. A fourth artwork by Mexican painter Diego Rivera will also be on display in a separate project. The museums will contribute their own artwork to a traveling exhibition that will end at the Smithsonian in 2023.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan wants state police to have body cameras. WCAX-TV reports the state police say they’d like to supply troopers with body cameras, but they don’t have the approximately $260,000 a year needed to store the information. Donovan says body cameras have limitations, but they still provide the best evidence as to what happened in some situations. He says they are good for the officer and the citizens because they provide “a true and accurate picture of what transpired at the scene.” Currently members of the state police tactical teams wear body cameras, but troopers do not while on routine patrol. State police officials say obtaining body cameras for all troopers is one of the agency’s top priorities.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: With about a year left before the prescribed closure of the Central Virginia Training Center, the state has moved most of its patients with intellectual and physical disabilities into community-based care settings. But the state is still struggling to comply with other requirements in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and has not yet determined the fate of the complex. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services told a legislative subcommittee Monday that the state has made “excellent progress” in transitioning patients. A DOJ investigation found that the way Virginia treated disabled people in training centers violated their civil rights. Since then, the number of people living in the large institutions has dropped by 89%, from 1,084 to 116.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is suing the Navy over its expansion of jet operations on Whidbey Island. Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the federal lawsuit Tuesday, saying the Navy failed to adequately examine the effects that having nearly 50,000 flights per year would have on people or wildlife. The Navy in March authorized the expansion of its Growler program by up to three dozen jets, adding to the 82 already based on Whidbey Island. The jets conduct electronic warfare to jam enemy communications and launch systems. The Navy’s public affairs office said it does not comment on litigation. Ferguson said that while the Navy has an important job, and its crews must be able to train, it must also follow its obligations to avoid unnecessary harm to human health and the environment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPineville: Nicole Sadecky, a graduate student at West Liberty University, has spent the past year wading the shallows of two southern West Virginia streams, tracking the movements of Cambarus veteranus, colloquially known as the Guyandotte crayfish. She hopes her research might someday help get the rare crawdad off the federal Endangered Species List. The Guyandotte crayfish, once thought extinct, was rediscovered in 2009 by Sadecky’s mentor, West Liberty professor Zac Loughman. Historically, the creature had been found in eight streams, all tributaries to the upper Guyandotte River in Wyoming and Logan counties. Loughman found it at only one site in only one Wyoming County stream, Pinnacle Creek. Subsequent studies discovered the species’ presence in Clear Fork, another Wyoming County stream a dozen miles to the northwest, but that turned out to be the extent of it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nEast Troy: Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young and the Dave Matthews Band will headline Farm Aid 2019 when the music and food festival visits the state’s dairy country this fall. Tickets for the Sept. 21 event at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy go on sale Friday. Farm Aid says the farming economy this year resembles how things were when Nelson founded Farm Aid in 1985. Nelson says devastating weather, low prices, and current federal farm and trade policies pose enormous challenges to family farmers struggling to keep their farms. Other performers include Bonnie Raitt, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, Margo Price, Jamey Johnson, Tanya Tucker, Brothers Osborne, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, Yola, and Particle Kid. Farm Aid has raised $57 million since 1985.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State and tribal officials are trying to make it easier for people to use tribal identification to register to vote. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan met with leaders of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes last week to talk about how the state could allow tribal IDs to be the only form of identification tribe members would need to register. Tribal IDs can currently be used to register, but a driver’s license, its number or a Social Security number must also be presented. The meetings came after the Wyoming Democratic Party alleged that members of the two Wind River Reservation tribes had difficulties registering to vote for last year’s election. An investigation determined election workers followed the law, and no eligible tribal members were prevented from voting.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/20/pigeon-hats-cushion-cash-chaka-khan-news-around-states/41032359/", "title": "More pigeon hats, cushion cash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time.” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive.” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You.” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse.” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them.” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination.” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve.” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare.” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts.” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection.” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable.” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/12/28/wilmington-nc-port-deeper-despite-environment-concerns/8802609002/", "title": "How rising seas could bring new challenges for two big Wilmington ...", "text": "Gareth McGrath\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nWhere the Cape Fear River flows dark and murky through downtown Wilmington, a pair of large proposed projects deemed vital to keeping the state’s economy moving forward — and as political priorities by state and local officials — converge.\n\nBut both face significant environmental and financial hurdles, although one received a major down payment in the new North Carolina state budget, and could see significant changes in response to a changing climate.\n\nOne is a bridge. The other a deeper shipping channel. Both are intricately woven in with the Cape Fear River, the natural artery that equally unites and divides much of Southeastern North Carolina.\n\nThey also share a potential time line of a decade or more to come to fruition, assuming all regulatory and financial hurdles associated with price tags that could approach $1 billion each can be overcome. And for both projects, officials say time is of the essence.\n\n\"I'd say we need both of them,\" said Charlie Wilkins as he fished on a cool November day from a public boat ramp in the shadow of the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge, the metal lift section of the 1960s-era bridge rattling above him as trucks roared over it. \"But that's a lot of money, that's for sure.\"\n\nGrowing the port, Wilmington and N.C.\n\nJust south of downtown and the Memorial Bridge sits the Port of Wilmington, a smallish-sized commercial entity compared to some of its peers that has capitalized on its uncrowded status to offer quick turnarounds and ease of entry and exit to its customers.\n\nBut as the container ships that ply the oceans have grown in size in conjunction with the widening of the Panama Canal to accommodate them, officials have decided the port needs to get bigger to stay relevant.\n\nWilmington is doing just that. Along with adding more huge container cranes onshore, a new gate access, and widening the port’s turning basin, that also means getting deeper water access. The Cape Fear River shipping channel connects the port with the Atlantic, providing a 42-foot depth access to Wilmington. Officials now want to see the roughly 26-mile-long channel deepened to 47 feet.\n\n“Improvements to the federal navigation channel would increase the efficiency of cargo vessels currently using the port, as well as allow the use of larger, more efficient vessels in the future,” states the project’s feasibility study, an early look at the proposed project that doesn't include a detailed review, that was conducted by the ports. “This increase in efficiency will result in significant transportation cost savings compared to the expected future without-project conditions, especially as the realization of opportunities for increased vessel efficiency allows the Port of Wilmington to remain a port-of-call on (U.S. East Coast)-Asia services.”\n\nThe channel's last deepening project, completed in 2004 and with the federal government picking up roughly $280 million of the project's $400 million price tag, took the channel depth from 38 feet to 42 feet. The port has seen tremendous container growth since then, setting a record during the 2020-21 fiscal year with more than 324,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units, the standard measure for containers) handled. That's almost triple what it was two decades ago.\n\nBut that number is still just a fraction of the 5.3 million containers that flowed through Savannah's massive port last year. And the Georgia port, like the huge ports in Charleston, S.C., and Norfolk, Va., are already deeper than Wilmington. Charleston will soon offer a 52-foot draft, while Savannah is at 47 feet. Norfolk's channel, which also serves the largest Navy base in the world, is aiming to have 55 feet of depth by mid-decade.\n\nThat has led some critics to wonder why the country needs all of these deepwater ports, all seemingly in a race to get deeper via taxpayer-funded projects every few years, within a couple hundred miles of each other.\n\nBrian Clark, who was appointed executive director of the N.C. State Ports Authority in June 2020, said Wilmington knows its role.\n\n\"Our goal is not to be a Savannah or one of the larger ports,\" he said last month. \"It's to support the state and the shippers and businesses here in North Carolina with superior service at the lowest cost.\"\n\nHe added that the significant investments made to the port in recent years, which could include a massive rail realignment project in coming years, coupled with the proposed deepening project are vital to the facility's future and its ability to act as a statewide jobs and business investment catalyst.\n\n“Our position is that one goes with the other, particular with the carriers deploying these larger vessels,\" Clark said. \"Absent these projects, the concern is that we’re not going to be considered for these services in the future.\"\n\nA 2021 study in the journal Maritime Transportation Research found that small U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports did generally benefit from the expansion of the Panama Canal and the increasing use of mega-container ships by carriers. They did this largely by leveraging and investing in their competitive advantages, namely in ease of access compared to larger ports and proximity to certain markets.\n\nThe Wilmington port in recent decades also has received strong bipartisan backing from Raleigh. That political support was reinforced last month when a compromise budget bill between the Republican-controlled General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper included nearly $284 million in state funding for the deepening project. According to the corps' study, deepening the channel by 5 feet would cost roughly $750 million in 2019 dollars, with the federal government picking up 75% of the cost of the project, which has been authorized by Congress but not funded. The state would be responsible for the other 25%.\n\nState Sen. Michael Lee, the Republican representative for New Hanover County and former chair of the N.C. State Ports Authority Board of Directors, said the state dollars — aside from possibly funding reviews and other studies — would be accessed once the deepening project has received all of the necessary federal and state regulatory approvals. But he said earmarking the dollars for the work at this early stage sends an important message.\n\n\"It lets our businesses here in North Carolina and our carriers know that we're very interested in investing and securing the future for our ports,\" he said, noting the value of the ports as job creators across the state.\n\nWill bigger vessels mean bigger problems?\n\nBut the proposed channel deepening isn't without its criticisms and concerns, many mirroring issues raised around the last deepening project in the 1990s.\n\nCost is a major one. But environmental questions are expected to be amplified this time around by increasing concerns about climate change, particularly sea-level rise.\n\nKerri Allen, a coastal advocate with the N.C. Coastal Federation, the coast's largest environmental watchdog group, said it's natural to think a deeper channel handling bigger vessels will create a new set of environmental concerns.\n\nAlready Caswell Beach and Bald Head Island, which lie on either side of the mouth of the Cape Fear River, have raised concerns about how a deepened channel would worsen the erosion woes along their shorelines. According to town officials, those problems increased in the early 2000s after the corps modified the navigation channel to make it easier for ships entering and exiting the river.\n\nThen there are the potential impacts on wetlands, bird habitats, endangered species and the Cape Fear River's tributaries as more and bigger vessels traverse to and from Wilmington.\n\nBut it is potential impacts caused by sea-level rise that is raising the most red flags among environmentalists.\n\nAccording to the deepening project's feasibility study, \"projected future sea level changes through the end of the proposed project’s design life (2077) range from 0.34 ft. under the low scenario to 2.57 ft. under the high scenario.\"\n\n\"The sea-level rise figures included in the study are quite frankly inaccurate and outdated,\" Allen said, noting research released in the lead up to this fall's United Nation's Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. Scotland, that showed the seas rising much faster than earlier forecast.\n\nRamona McGee, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed the concerns about some of the feasibility study's estimates and environmental projections. She said she expects the upcoming environmental impact statement (EIS) to include a more thorough and objective look at the proposal.\n\n\"We want to ensure the project goes through the appropriate environmental review at the appropriate time so the project isn't just getting a rubber stamp approval after the fact,\" McGee said.\n\nDave Connolly, spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers' Wilmington District, said several issues have been flagged for further review before the project's draft EIS is published. They are the project's economic assumptions, sea-level rise projections and salinity issues. An independent peer review is also planned.\n\n\"We anticipate these efforts will take at least two years subject to the availability of funds,\" Connolly said via email.\n\nPort officials said they look forward to working with the corps, the regulatory agencies and other groups to make sure all environmental concerns are addressed.\n\nSecuring a bridge's future\n\nWhile the channel deepening project has a path, albeit a potentially challenging one, to becoming reality, the route is much less clear for a major on-land component that could be vital for the Port of Wilmington to reach its full potential.\n\nMost of the container traffic entering and leaving the port travels via truck over the Memorial Bridge, a volume of traffic that is expected to keep increasing in coming years with or without a deepened channel.\n\nBut the span, which opened in 1969 and links New Hanover and Brunswick counties, is in its twilight years, and DOT officials have preached for years that the structure doesn’t have much life left in it. The bridge's approach roads in Brunswick County also travel across low-lying Eagles Island, leaving them potentially prone to increased flooding as the seas rise and climate change brings more extreme weather events to the coast.\n\nYet proposal after proposal for a replacement structure have been put forward only to later sink in a bog of political quicksand and squabbling among local officials.\n\nPlans to replace the Memorial Bridge first started percolating in the late 1990s, picking up steam in the early 2000s. But the “Cape Fear Skyway” fell apart over disagreements over its cost and where a new bridge and its approach roads should be, with so much bad blood between local officials that it was decided to drop the word “Skyway” from future proposals.\n\nA later push, dubbed the “Cape Fear Crossing,” also stalled over the highway’s billion dollar-plus price tag for a new bridge south of the Port of Wilmington and its proposed path In Brunswick County. Most recently, a proposal by a private company to partner with the DOT to build a replacement bridge largely using the same footprint and approach roads as the existing Memorial Bridge fizzled over concerns over tolls and the impact on communities on the Wilmington side of the river.\n\nBut the need for a new crossing to relieve pressure on the four-lane Memorial Bridge and add capacity beyond the two other bridges over the Cape Fear — the Isabel Holmes drawbridge and the Interstate 140 Dan Cameron Bridge, both north of downtown Wilmington — is growing year by year. And how to fund a new bridge, which could easily cost $500 million for just a replacement structure, has yet to be tackled.\n\nThe bridge handled about 69,000 vehicles a day in 2020, according to the latest traffic count, with that number expected to keep increasing by several thousand vehicles a day for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe bridge also is viewed by emergency officials as a key cog in the region’s ability to prepare, evacuate and then recover from any hurricane strike, especially as the Wilmington area’s population continues to increase rapidly. The tri-county region’s population, which has already expanded rapidly in recent decades to an estimated 459,000 in 2021, is expected to jump another 40% by 2040, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFinancing questions, political uncertainty and other growing needs have seen the project consistently struggle to rank high on the region's transportation planning list, leaving it as the top unfunded priority by the Wilmington Metropolitan Planning Organization, a group of local elected leaders that sets transportation policy for the Cape Fear region.\n\nFor not the first time, Chad Kimes, head of the Wilmington-area's DOT division, stressed the need to map out a replacement strategy for the aging structure.\n\n“The bridge is perfectly safe right now and will be for several more years, but it’s time to start looking into a replacement,\" he said last month, adding that a new bridge could take up to 10 years to permit, design, acquire the necessary land and build.\n\nWith the bridge's movable middle lift-section likely to need a major rehabilitation within a decade and the structure's fixed areas a similar upgrade soon after that, Kimes said major, expensive and inevitably inconvenient maintenance needs are coming up quickly.\n\n\"There's no panic right now,\" he said, \"but the clock is ticking.\"\n\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on Twitter.

The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, “had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof.” The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state’s oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 – the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways – buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. “We’re experiencing record high inflation that we haven’t seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn’t have come at a better time for those living on the state’s vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro’s fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man’s Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey’s car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, “ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose.” The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found “two males with bloody faces” at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat’s COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city’s quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco’s lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. “We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,” said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee’s next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November’s election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school’s slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones’ promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they’ve endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. “There are days when grief is just so awful,” said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. “Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn’t exist. That compounds everything.” One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington’s financially ailing operator must pay a ship loading company more than $28million – an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5 million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services – a local ship loading company already doing business at the port – to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer’s local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26 million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer’s officials had carried out “bulldogged” efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, WUSA-TV reports. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. “No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,” one woman said. “I don’t know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,” a man said. “Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,” one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury’s presence, accusing them of being “unprofessional” when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were “the zenith of the cumulative disdain” they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer’s comments didn’t rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge’s “expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger” against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s “Tribal Homelands Initiative,” which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. “This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country’s tribal nations,” Haaland said at last weekend’s 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem. Georgia’s congressional delegation is on board, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has been welcomed as an essential partner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Maui County Council is pushing a resolution that would allow counties to set higher minimum wages than the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Maui leaders endorsed the idea from council member Gabe Johnson, who pointed to variances in the cost of living from one area to another in advocating for the move. Three other county councils would have to approve before the resolution could be considered in the Legislature next year, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho’s plan to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm cleared a big hurdle Tuesday. Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university’s plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state’s dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school’s proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry – Idaho’s is the third largest in the nation – faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn’t been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38 million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325 million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant’s releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant’s most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220 million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100 million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant’s original owner, $5 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared, eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner’s office, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner’s Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner’s office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some “natural” deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. “It’s unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,” said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state law enforcement oversight board reprimanded a sheriff’s deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied in the deputy’s vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas “struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, ‘hog-tied’ and ultimately tased L.H.,” the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky’s history, officials said. Discover Kentucky Archaeology, at archaeology.ky.gov, was launched by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office in partnership with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, a statement from the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said. It includes information on more than 100 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites across 64 counties. The site was launched in September, which is celebrated as Kentucky Archaeology Month. Prehistoric sites include a Native American rockshelter in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and historic sites include Saltpeter Cave, a frontier-era niter mine in Carter County, the statement said. Each archaeological site includes a summary, findings, a focus on “what’s cool” and links to related materials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three small insect-eating raptors called Mississippi kites have been released by Louisiana State University’s wildlife hospital. The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one – brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg – excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital’s director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, “Now I know what these things on my sides are for.” The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge’s decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said this week that they’re appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is “escalating its fight to save Maine’s lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,” said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen’s association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years. The state and the fishermen have appealed their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: A historic inn where President George Washington reportedly once stayed is on the market. The historic Washington Inn & Tavern, the centerpiece of the Eastern Shore town of Princess Anne, is said to have housed the late president, said Town Manager Clayton Anderson. Built in 1744, before America’s independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn & Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the “Bewitched” statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery – as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom – sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was “going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested” and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days. The statue was erected in the city famous for the 1692 witch trials in 2005, despite protests from some who said it trivializes the tragedy of the trials.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city sued the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday over population estimates from last year that show it lost an additional 7,100 residents, opening another front against the agency in a battle over how Detroit’s people have been counted in the past two years. Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau’s refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city’s reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. “The Bureau’s failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City’s historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,” the lawsuit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator. Brendon Daugherty was being held in the Sherburne County Jail, in Elk River, on charges of threatening to murder a U.S. official and interstate transmission of a threat. Court records do not identify the senator other than to say it was not someone who represented Minnesota. According to the indictment, Daugherty left two threatening voicemail messages at the senator’s field office in June. Field office staff contacted U.S. Capitol Police. FBI agents spoke with Daugherty at his Coon Rapids home Sept. 2. He told the agents that he made the calls because the senator was “doing a bunch of stupid (expletive) with gun control” and that he wants politicians to “feel a little bit pressured,” the Star Tribune reports. According to court records, the 35-year-old Daugherty was convicted in October 2018 of two felony counts for threatening to burn down a Pearl Vision store in Maple Grove and harm the employees. Daugherty was angry that he owed $80 for replacement glasses, according to charges.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been awarded a $5.8million grant for the construction of an Advanced Workforce Training Center. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced that the department’s Economic Development Administration is awarding the $5.8 million grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for the construction of the Advanced Workforce Training Center. The grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan’s Indigenous Communities Program, a press release said. “Workforce development is a primary focus for our Tribe,” Chief Cyrus Ben said in the press release. “We have undertaken many projects to help our community members prepare to face a challenging and ever-evolving job market. This Workforce Training Center is a key component of our strategy to increase the skills of our Tribal members, whether they choose a career on or outside of our Tribal lands.” Anna Denson, project manager of economic development, said the planning process took more than a year. “As of today, our National Center for construction education and research offers HVAC, electrical and industrial maintenance to tribal employees with very little room, but the goal is to expand with the new center,” Denson said.\n\nMissouri\n\nHartville: A small hamlet in the Ozarks has found itself in the middle of everything. Officials from the nation’s capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn’t have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation’s population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be “the balance point” if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size – each representing the location of one person – placed on it.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The state’s fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the University of Montana contributed to the new study titled “Socioeconomic resilience to climatic extremes in a freshwater fishery,” which ran in the journal Science Advances this month, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. “Trout fisheries have enormous cultural, economic and ecological importance in Montana and worldwide, yet even Montana’s resilient trout fisheries could be vulnerable to future climate change,” Timothy Cline, a USGS scientist and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. The authors used Montana FWP’s recreation monitoring data to analyze how climate change affected 3,100 miles of the state’s rivers between 1983 and 2017. They found that the concentration of anglers doubled overall within that 34-year time period, and severe drought conditions, which drive stream flows down and water temperatures up, significantly affected how that fishing pressure was distributed across the landscape.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Regents at the University of Nebraska are poised to consider allowing beer sales permanently for Husker events at Pinnacle Bank Arena, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The NU Board of Regents plans to vote on the exemption next week.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: A sprawling southern Nevada county that embraced misinformation about electronic voting machines is set to conduct its midterm election this fall using hand-counted paper ballots, a county official confirmed Tuesday. “This is very locked in,” said newly appointed Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf, a 2020 election denier, of his plans to implement the old-fashioned process in a county with roughly 33,000 active registered voters. Nye, the largest county by area in Nevada and the third-largest in the United States, has been at the forefront of the Republican Party’s push to ditch electronic voting – an ongoing effort fueled by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Now, less than 50 days before the midterm election, the rural county remains committed to that disinformation campaign despite warnings from experts who say counting ballots by hand could invite more error and fraud. All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election, Kampf, the county’s top voting official, said in a presentation Tuesday to Nye’s five-member Board of Commissioners. But at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and “special needs.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is using $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to support homeless shelters this winter. The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6% from 2021. The federal funds will provide $4 million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and $1 million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRidgewood: Will students make it to class more alert and on time if high school starts 45 minutes later? The school district’s parents and teachers were more skeptical than students about any positive outcomes of a later school day start in a 24-page report by K-12 Insights that was presented to the Ridgewood Board of Education on Monday. The report analyzed the results of a district survey distributed in May to parents, students, teachers and community members seeking input about a proposed move of the high school start time from 7:45 to 8:30 a.m. The later starting time is the subject of a nationwide educational debate. Multiple studies indicate it’s not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night – it’s a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be “dazed and confused” in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8 a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill. So far, only a few districts, including Tenafly, Princeton and South Orange/Maplewood, have adopted the later start time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A politician and Trump supporter who was removed and barred from elected office for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, is attempting to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. Cowboys for Trump co-founder and former county commissioner Couy Griffin on Tuesday notified the high court of his intent to appeal. The ruling against Griffin this month from a Santa Fe-based District Court was the first to remove or bar an elected official from office in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol building that disrupted Congress as it was trying to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. “Mr. Acevedo’s tragic passing is an immense loss,” Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb. 27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. “Once again, their system failed,” Acevedo’s attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. “I mean, he shouldn’t have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual.” The state attorney general’s office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner’s office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina’s bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina’s proposal would cover the “University Hub” region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump’s discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state’s high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore “Tore” Maras, who calls President Joe Biden “resident not president” and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her “Tore Says” podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican, joining the court’s three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras’ roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose’s office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official – acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter – filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official’s favor, and LaRose’s office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWynnewood: Joe Exotic is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune “I Saw a Tiger” in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further “unauthorized use” of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. “I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,” he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. “It’s super hard on families,” said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddletown: A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team’s season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. “This investigation did not involve just hazing or ‘boys will be boys’ conduct,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. “Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing.” Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed “a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment” to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts “completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, was “a strong leader” who was especially good to the city’s senior citizens, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. “She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,” Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard’s residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn’t seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for “a couple of weeks,” police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. “She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history,” Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city’s first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel’s Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn’t guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel’s Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel’s Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor’s office did not follow the state’s open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor’s safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota’s Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem’s labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren’s retirement in the weeks after Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure – a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday. Chelsea Clinton, the foundation’s vice chair, made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative’s two-day meeting of international dignitaries in New York. The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year’s gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving “humanity’s most pressing problems,” ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. “Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,” Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states. Previous hosts include the University of Chicago, Howard University, and member schools of the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Alarmed parents converged on a high school Tuesday after a classroom shooting report that ultimately proved to be false. The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. “Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,” said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. “We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened.” Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother’s 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still “haunt him and his family,” said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron’s family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family’s lawsuit even longer, he said. “There are mixed emotions by the family,” Morris said. “It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues.” After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mandatory testing for lead in drinking water – and repairs to keep that water safe – has been completed at 98% of the state’s schools and child care centers, the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2019 requiring schools and child care facilities to test their drinking and cooking water for lead, a highly toxic metal. Roughly 1 in 5 taps had elevated lead levels out of the more than 15,000 taps tested between June 2019 and December 2021. Lead exposure can slow children’s growth, impair development and learning, and cause behavioral problems. Lead was more frequently found in water fixtures, rather than plumbing, which made fixes both easier and less expensive. The state provided funding to reimburse schools and child care centers for remediation costs, 90% of which cost less than $500. “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect and promote the health and safety of children in early care and education programs,” said Commissioner Sean Brown of the Agency of Human Services’ Child Development Division. “Collaborative efforts like this help ensure that children in Vermont have positive, safe learning environments in which they can grow and develop.”\n\nVirginia\n\nMartinsville: A marker has been dedicated in front of the old Henry County Courthouse recognizing the Martinsville Seven, a group of Black men executed in 1951 over an alleged rape. “Here in 1949, six all-white, all-male juries convicted seven Black men of the rape of a white woman. All seven men were sentenced to death. On appeal, NAACP attorneys submitted the first petition to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that capital punishment had been disproportionately applied against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment. Despite international attention and petitions for clemency, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed the men in Feb. 1951, the most executions for a rape in U.S. history,” the marker says. The old Henry County Courthouse is now the Martinsville-Henry County Heritage Center and Museum, inside which a display recounts the day in 1949 when Ruby Floyd told police she had been raped. Francis Grayson, Frank Hairston Jr., Howard Hairston, James Hairston, Joe Hampton, Booker Millner and John Taylor were arrested and confessed. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the confessions were coerced, but all seven men were found guilty and sentenced to death. The NAACP failed in its appeal, and over just four days, the seven were put to death by the electric chair in Richmond.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Next year voters will decide whether the city should set up a public developer to create affordable housing. The Seattle Times reports the City Council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to allow King County Elections to put the proposed Initiative 135 on the ballot of a special election to be held Feb. 14, 2023. If I-135 passes, it would create a public development authority, called the Seattle Social Housing Developer, to construct homes and take over existing properties using government and philanthropic funding to create renter-governed housing. Those who favor the initiative say housing would be protected from rental market forces in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Walmart and CVS Pharmacy have settled with the state of West Virginia for a combined total of $147 million in a lawsuit over the companies’ roles in contributing to the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the opioid epidemic in the country’s most impacted state, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday. Walmart and CVS were two lawsuits that were part of a larger trial that was pushed back to June of next year along with Kroger and Walgreens. Morrisey recently announced a settlement with Rite Aid for up to $30 million to resolve similar litigation. The lawsuits allege the pharmacies’ contributions to the oversupply of prescription opioids in the state have caused “significant losses through their past and ongoing medical treatment costs, including for minors born addicted to opioids, rehabilitation costs, naloxone costs, medical examiner expenses, self-funded state insurance costs and other forms of losses to address opioid-related afflictions and loss of lives.” It brings the total settlements by the state in opioid lawsuits to $875 million, including $296 million with manufacturers, $400 million with wholesalers and $177.5 million involving pharmacies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has called on Gov. Tony Evers to halt all paroles in the state, even though a governor can’t unilaterally order them to stop, and some paroles are mandated by law. Michels has been hitting Evers as being soft on crime, accusing the Democrat in a letter Monday of sympathizing with and coddling “brutal, convicted criminals.” Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said it would be illegal to do as Michels wants and called the request “an uninformed stunt to score political points by someone who has no regard or appreciation for the laws of our state.” Michels and Evers are knotted in a tight contest in the battleground state that polls show is about even. Michaels, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump and is the co-owner of the state’s largest construction company, has been attacking Evers over his parole policies and his response to violent protests in Kenosha two years ago that followed the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by a white police officer. Wisconsin’s parole commission, which operates independently of the governor, has granted about 460 discretionary paroles not required by law, something that both Republican and Democratic governors before Evers also routinely granted.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Rockslides have seemingly been ramping up in the Tetons, mountain guides say, and scientists are pointing to climate change as a likely culprit, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The anecdotal increase in rockfall in the mountain range comes as warmer temperatures take their toll on glaciers, which long covered the Tetons. Simeon Caskey, head of the physical science branch at Grand Teton National Park, told the newspaper that so-called weathering is behind much of the rockfall, with shifting water and ice leading to changes in the geologic structure of the area. “We’ve seen from some studies in the Alps that rockfall is happening more frequently at higher elevations as a result of climate change and increased temperatures and increased extreme rainfall events,” he said, calling that European mountain range an “appropriate analogue for what’s happening in the Tetons.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/27/waukesha-memorial-removed-daring-hawaii-rescue-shark-attack-news-around-states/49574221/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: A development project being planned would highlight the history of the city’s Black community, the Opelika-Auburn News reported. Auburn Parks and Recreation is working on plans for the Boykin-Donahue Campus, which would bring a cultural center, library, recreation center and splash pad to the area behind its Boykin Community Center. The Boykin-Donahue Cultural Center would act as a museum to provide an overview of the history of Auburn’s Black community, said department director Becky Richardson. She said the project was still in the “concept phase.” but officials hope to begin work in 2022. City Manager Megan Crouch told council members it would cost about $40 million.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Marines on snowmobiles helped Santa this month while delivering toys to boys and girls in Alaska’s Arctic. Marines flew to Kotzebue, which is 549 miles northwest of Anchorage and 26 miles above the Arctic Circle, on a KC-130 operated by the Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 based in Okinawa, Japan. From there, they rode commercial flights and snowmobiles to get toys to 2,500 children in 11 villages, the Juneau Empire reported. Cpl. Brendan Mullin, who took pictures of the event, could hear children gasp when a Marine Santa entered a prekindergarten classroom. “When you can see the smile through the mask, you know it’s a big, genuine smile,” Mullin said. Their joyful job was part of the Toys for Tots program run by the Marine Corps and a nonprofit foundation. Started in 1947, the program now delivers 18 million toys to 7 million less fortunate children each year. The half-dozen Marines who participated were primarily from Delta Company of the 4th Law Enforcement Battalion, a Reserve unit.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A mall desert owl known for nesting in Arizona’s saguaro cactus might get some federal protection restored, according to a proposal from federal wildlife officials. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week formally registered a proposal to list the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl as a threatened species, the Arizona Daily Star reported. Being classified as threatened instead of endangered signals officials’ belief the owl faces potential harm. Factors that could put the owl in danger include climate change, loss of habitat and the presence of invasive species. The service’s proposal is the culmination of years of petitions and lawsuits filed by environmental groups. In 2017, a federal judge ruled the wildlife service failed to accurately interpret the Endangered Species Act. Fish and Wildlife officials later agreed to partner with other groups and conduct a new “species status assessment” of the owl. An approved listing would mean some restrictions on development around Pima County and elsewhere. The owl lives in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora and southern Texas. The brown-and-white bird measures about 6.7 inches. The pygmy owl was protected as an endangered species from 1997 to 2006, but lost that status following a developer’s lawsuit that resulted in the protection’s removal. The Southern Arizona Home Builders Association, which was the plaintiff in that lawsuit, has not weighed in on this development. The Fish and Wildlife proposal still needs to go through a 60-day public comment period.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in Arkansas, making federal relief funding available in five north eastern counties hit by tornadoes that ripped through the Midwest and South this month. The Friday declaration opens grants for temporary housing, home repairs and other assistance to people affected by the swarm of twisters that left dozens dead across multiple states on Dec. 10 and 11. The White House said in a statement that federal funding would be available to people in the counties of Craighead, Jackson, Mississippi, Poinsett, and Woodruff, and for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, thanked Biden for the “quick response” in a statement on Twitter on Friday morning. The weekend storms killed about 90 people in five states, including two in Arkansas. The National Weather Service recorded at least 41 tornadoes, with 16 in Tennessee and eight in Kentucky.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMorro Bay: A surfer was killed in an apparent shark attack on Christmas Eve off the central coast of California, authorities said. The male surfer was pulled from the water north of Morro Rock about 10:45 a.m., Morro Bay police said on Twitter on Friday. He was not responsive after being brought to land. The surfer’s identity was not immediately released and officials ordered people to stay out of the water for 24 hours. Morro Bay Harbor Director Eric Endersby told The San Luis Obispo Tribune that a female surfer nearby saw the male surfer facedown and got him out of the water. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Endersby said the attack appeared to have been recent based on the condition of the surfer’s body. Crews will patrol the area to look for the shark. “Obviously, it’s tragic and we’re all sad, especially given the time this occurred,” Endersby told the newspaper. “It’s tragic this happened. We’re all sad and our condolences go out to the families.” Morro Bay is about 200 miles north of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Theodore “Ted” Kaczynski, also known as the “Unabomber,” has been transferred to a federal prison medical facility in North Carolina after spending the past two decades in a federal Supermax prison in Colorado for a series of bombings targeting scientists. Kaczynski, 79, was moved to the U.S. Bureau of Prison’s FMC Butner medical center in eastern North Carolina on Dec. 14, according to bureau spokesperson Donald Murphy. Murphy declined to disclose any details of Kaczynski’s medical condition or the reason for his transfer. Kaczynski is serving life without the possibility of parole following his 1996 arrest at the primitive cabin where he was living in western Montana. He pleaded guilty to setting 16 explosions that killed three people and injured 23 others in various parts of the country between 1978 and 1995. The Federal Medical Center Butner, in North Carolina’s Granville County just northeast of Durham, offers medical services for prisoners including oncology, surgery, neurodiagnostics and dialysis, according to the Bureau of Prisons. It opened an advanced care unit and a hospice unit in 2010. Butner has 771 inmates, according to the prison bureau, and has been home to notable offenders including John Hinckley Jr., who was evaluated there after shooting President Ronald Reagan, and Bernard Madoff, the infamous architect of a massive Ponzi scheme who died at the facility earlier this year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A small number of attendees at a recent holiday party hosted by Gov. Ned Lamont and his wife at their Greenwich home have tested positive for the coronavirus, a spokesperson for the Democratic governor said. Both Lamont and his wife Annie, however, have regularly tested negative for the virus since the Dec. 11 private event, where guests were required to provide proof of being fully vaccinated and present a negative test, according to Max Reiss, Lamont’s director of communications. Reiss said the couple were told a week after the party that a “small number of attendees” had tested positive, Fox 61-TV reported. He noted that Lamont has regularly been attending two or three public events daily, including large indoor events. He did not say how many people were on hand the party or whether Lamont and others wore masks, according to Hearst. Unlike in 2020, there are no limits during this holiday season on the number of people who can attend indoor events, although unvaccinated people are still required to wear masks in such settings. Masks are required to be worn by everyone in certain places such as health care facilities, schools and public transit. Also, businesses and local government offices have the option to require masks for everyone.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware State University will delay the return of students to campus by two weeks because of a surge in coronavirus cases that is being driven by the omicron variant. The Delaware State News reported classes will begin as planned on Jan. 10. But they will be held virtually for those two weeks. The school is also requiring all students to get a COVID-19 booster shot before coming back to campus. Dr. Michelle Fisher, associate vice president of Campus Health, added that the booster shot does not provide maximum effectiveness until two weeks after it’s given. “The University wants its students as fully protected as possible before they arrive on campus at the beginning of the semester,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Eight libraries are among the 36 sites in D.C. where people can pick up and drop off at-home PCR tests, WUSA-TV reported. The libraries received deliveries of rapid at-home testing kits Wednesday morning. Rapid tests have been hot items at pharmacies in the area during the holiday season because of trael. DC Health has also ordered 1,050,000 rapid antigen tests, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said in a press release.. . DC Health will supply the library branches with 1,000 rapid test kits each, per day. Residents will be able to obtain two kits, or four tests, per day, at those locations. Proof of residency is also required to get the kits. After using a rapid at-home test, residents should report their results to DC Health at coronavirus.dc.gov/overthecounter. You can check the availability of test kits here.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: If you’re planning to rent a home in central Florida over New Year’s Eve, you might be out of luck. Airbnb said potential guests without a history of positive reviews will be unable to make one-night reservations in Orlando and Kissimmee over New Year’s Eve to crack down on disruptive parties. Some people also will be unable to make last-minute, two- or three-night reservations over the New Year’s holiday in central Florida if they don’t have any positive reviews, as determined by the company’s algorithms. Users with a history of positive reviews don’t have to worry about those restrictions. The New Year’s Eve restrictions in central Florida are part of a larger worldwide effort by Airbnb to crack down on disruptive parties held at the short-term rental homes. Last New Year’s Eve was the first time the company tried the initiative. It blocked 1,200 rentals in Orlando and 750 rentals in Kissimmee. Around the world, 243,000 rentals were blocked.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonprofit organization has raised more than $50,000 after thousands of dollars worth of gifts for needy children were stolen from its Atlanta warehouse. A fundraiser by the Empty Stocking Fund following the burglary was up to $54,000, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “We have worked so hard and done so much,” Manda Hunt, the nonprofit organization’s executive director, told the newspaper. “We’ve already successfully distributed gifts to 20,000 kids. I’m determined to end on a high note.” Volunteers arrived at the organization’s 24,000-square-foot warehouse in southwest Atlanta on Wednesday to find a huge hole in a cinderblock wall and the gifts gone. Hunt said her team still does not know exactly how much was taken, but the burglary will prevent the organization from distributing as many gifts as it had hoped to give away. “We just can’t even have people in the building right now,” Hunt said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Rescuers trekked through heavy snow and sleet to find a hiker lost in one of the most dangerous places in Hawaii. Rangers said the hiker registered at the the visitor’s center for Mauna Kea, Hawaii’s tallest peak, before he set off Tuesday morning. But the Center of Maunakea Stewardship said he gave rangers the wrong number. Rangers tried to contact him after it got dark, but couldn’t reach him. They used the hiker’s 911 calls to connect with him and narrow the search area. Rescuers hiked about a mile and found him Tuesday night in a small cave in “thick white-out conditions” at 13,000 feet above sea level, the center’s news release said. He was able to walk out on his own but was taken to a hospital. The mountain’s summit is dangerous because of “extreme altitude and weather conditions, and emergency services may be two hours away because of its remote location,” the release said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican Gov. Brad Little appointed Bellevue Mayor Ned Burns to a House seat representing central Idaho in the state Legislature. Burns, a Democrat, will fill out the remainder of the term for legislative district House seat 26 vacated by Democrat Muffy Davis. The term ends at the end of 2022. Burns was one of three recommendations put forward by Democrats to replace Davis, who was serving her second term in the Legislature. Little earlier this month appointed Davis to the Blaine County Commission, and she resigned her seat in the Legislature. “I’m thrilled Gov. Little chose Ned as my successor,” Davis said in a statement. “Ned is well prepared to jump into the role and hit the ground running to best represent the constituents of District 26.” The Legislature convenes on Jan. 10.\n\nIllinois\n\nMapleton:A contractor working at a Caterpillar Inc. foundry in central Illinois fell to his death when he apparently stepped off a ladder at the plant, authorities said. The Peoria County coroner said Scott M. Adams, 50, of East Peoria was pronounced dead about 11 a.m. Thursday after his fall at the foundry in Mapleton. Autopsy findings are pending, the (Peoria) Journal Star reported. Adams was working as a contractor at the foundry from Shaefer Electric in Peoria, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is investigating his death along with the county sheriff’s office. OSHA’s preliminary investigation leads the agency to believe Adams stepped off a ladder before falling 20 feet to his death through a hole in the floor. Caterpillar released a statement Thursday saying that it is “deeply saddened” by Adams’ death but cannot provide additional information on the incident because it remains under investigation.\n\nIndiana\n\nMartinsville:A new section of the Interstate 69 extension project in central Indiana has fully opened for traffic. Crews opened the highway’s southbound lanes through Martinsville on Thursday, three days after traffic was allowed on the northbound lanes, the Indiana Department of Transportation said. Drivers can now take the main route between Bloomington and Indianapolis that had been cut off since January as a 5-mile stretch of what was Indiana 37 through Martinsville was shut down to upgrade the roadway and build interchanges. Some construction work such as final paving, installation of signs and completion of drainage fixtures will continue into the new year, highway officials said. The I-69 project’s focus now turns to upgrading the Indiana 37 corridor between Martinsville and I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis. No full closures are planned on that section as construction is expected to continue into 2024. The I-69 extension has been under construction through southwestern Indiana since 2008 and runs from Evansville to Martinsville.\n\nIowa\n\nMerrill: Construction has begun on a 16-mile hiking and biking trail connecting the towns of Sioux City and Le Mars. The Sioux City Journal reported ground was broken Tuesday on the PlyWood Trail. The PlyWood Trail Foundation has raised more than $4 million from public and private sources, and is seeking state and federal grants. Foundation chairman Ryan Meyer said “quality of life” amenities are important in attracting workforce and young families to the area. Mike Wells, president of Le Mars-based Wells Enterprises, said the new trail along with the mountain bike trail at Cone Park will create a “bicycle destination in Northwest Iowa.” The company is a major donor.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:State officials are seeking relief for residents impacted by wildfires which torched more than 100,000 acres in four counties two weeks ago, killing two and burning houses, livestock and cropland. The fires were a result of historically high winds, some topping 100 mph, which slammed Kansas, leaving behind a wake of property damage and thousands of residents across the state without power. Twenty-four counties issued local disaster declarations as a result of the high wind. But the fires were most intense in Ellis, Osborne, Rooks and Russell counties. Fire damages likely to stretch in to the millions of dollars. State officials already have determined at least a dozen homes were lost to the fires, as well as 700 head of cattle, although Maj. Gen. David Weishaar, adjutant general of the Kansas National Guard, told legislators those numbers would likely rise. A damage assessment is being conducted, which will be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the first step in seeking federal relief. Weishaar said he believes the state will exceed the threshold needed to receive assistance.\n\nKentucky\n\nWinchester: Former Winchester Sun publisher Betty Berryman, the first female president of the Kentucky Press Association, died Saturday morning, the newspaper reported. Berryman, who served as publisher of the newspaper between 1988 and 2006, was 92. Her career at the Sun began in 1954 when she was hired as assistant to publisher James Tatman. She became general manager in 1974 and publisher in 1988. “Newspapering is exciting business,” Berryman said in an interview published by the Sun in 2018. “No two days are alike ever. There’s something new everyday.” Berryman became the first female president of the KPA in 1986 and was one of the first female press association presidents in the nation. She was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1996. “Betty was the kind of individual who commanded respect from newspaper folk, publishers, owners, editors – all granted her the respect she deserved. Everyone thought so much of Betty,” longtime KPA Executive Director David Thompson said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A Louisiana State University museum official has received a unique retirement gift – researchers in Alabama and South Carolina named a prehistoric shark species after her. Suyin Ting has been collections manager for vertebrate paleontology at the LSU Museum of Natural Science for 26 years. Her new namesake is Carcharhinus tingae, which lived 40 million years ago and was identified from fossilized teeth in the museum’s collection. “I am very honored to be recognized by my peers for my work,” Ting, who studied mammal paleontology, said in a news release Thursday, the day she retired. But, she added, the fact that David Cicimurri of the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia, and Jun Ebersole of the McWane Science Center in Birmingham, Alabama, also identified many other specimens for the museum is much more important. Their contribution to the vertebrate paleontology collection is huge, she said. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage rather than bone, their teeth are often the only fossils available. The two scientists realized that some hand-sized teeth were from a previously unrecognized species. Their paper identifying and describing it was published last week in the journal Cainozoic Research.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: State parks had a record number of visitors this year for a second year in a row. The Portland Press Herald reported Maine’s 42 state parks and historic sites had more than 3.2 million visitors through November, according to Jim Britt, spokesman for the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands. Last year the attendance was 3.1 million visitors. The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry also reported that state park campgrounds set a record this year with 315,000 campers, an increase of 12% from 2020. Britt said by email the parks and historic sites that saw the largest increases in visitors this year were Birch Point Beach State Park in Owls Head; Eagle Island State Historic Site off the coast of Harpswell; and Owls Head State Park, the newspaper reported. The parks that had the most visitors were the usual favorites, including Camden Hills State Park with 180,835, Popham Beach State Park with 185,669, Sebago Lake State Park with 189,959, and Reid State Park with 183,224.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: State health officials are advising health care providers to conserve a certain type of lifesaving antibody treatment for COVID-19 patients. The Baltimore Sun reported there are three types of monoclonal antibody treatments that have been approved by the federal government. But only one appears to be effective against the omicron variant of the coronavirus. The effective medication is now in limited supply across the nation. And it’s being reserved for patients who are 65 and older or for people who are immunocompromised. The scarcity of the one effective omicron treatment will have an impact on the state’s response to the latest surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Gov. Larry Hogan and the state’s health department made monoclonal antibodies a cornerstone of fighting the virus, especially among residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes.The treatments were once widely available in Maryland and are said to reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 illness by as much as 70% to 80% in some patients. Maryland Department of Health spokesman Andy Owen said additional therapies approved by the federal government will be incorporated in the state’s response. He added that monoclonal antibody therapies will continue to be made available to nursing home residents.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nConcord: A drawing purchased at an estate sale for $30 is believed to be a rare work by a Renaissance artist worth tens of millions of dollars. International art experts said the previously unknown drawing by Albrecht Dürer could be one of the most significant art discoveries in recent memory, The Boston Globe reported. The pen-and-ink drawing is about the size of a children’s book and depicts a seated Mary holding the newborn Jesus. Titled “The Virgin and Child with a Flower on a grassy Bench,” it was last sold about 2016 in Concord. The newspaper reported international art experts recently gathered at the British Museum in London to discuss the work. Christof Metzger, chief curator at the Albertina Museum in Vienna, which houses a trove of Dürer’s works, told the Globe he has “absolutely no doubt” it is an original work from the German master dating to the early 1500s. But Fritz Koreny, a former Albertina curator, suggested it likely is the work of the artist’s star pupil, Hans Baldung Grien. Dürer, who died in 1528, and was famed for his engravings and woodcuts. The Globe reported the drawing is currently being offered for sale by Agnews Gallery in London.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyoming: A western Michigan city plans to install a dozen cameras that will record license plate numbers. The effort in Wyoming is aimed at solving and reducing violent crime, MLive.com reported. The 12 automatic license plate recognition cameras will be installed within the next two months at six intersections. They will capture video as well as every license plate and the make, model and colors of vehicles that pass by them. The locations of the cameras can be changed. “Right now, we have about six or seven police officers on the street, and it’s difficult for us to be everywhere at every time,” Wyoming Police Chief Kim Koster told the newspaper. “We need assistance. We need some technology to help us in that regard, and the license plate readers are something that we started to see utilized by other agencies.” License plate numbers or descriptions about vehicles involved in crimes can be entered into a system which will notify officers if and when vehicles matching the plates or descriptions are detected passing through intersections equipped with the cameras, Koster said. The system will primarily be used for investigations into major crimes, including crimes against people, as well as aid in the search for stolen vehicles. The system won’t be used for traffic enforcement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMankato: Federal official are investigating whether people with disabilities can access Minnesota State University-Mankato’s new anti-COVID-19 study pods. The university installed 100 pods using $1 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds. The pods resemble pay telephone booths and are designed to provide students with individual study spaces so they can avoid catching the disease. Minnesota Public Radio reported Tuesday that Nancy Fitzsimmons, a social work professor at the university, believes people with disabilities can’t access the pods because they have to climb a step to enter them. She filed a federal complaint in September alleging the pods violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is investigating. University officials declined to comment but added four handicapped accessible pods around campus. These pods are essentially transparent rooms. Fitzsimmons said that’s not enough. The pods were placed in out-of-the-way places, including the basement of a computer center and in an administration building, she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A board of supervisors in north Mississippi is requesting the Legislature dedicate stretches of highway to a former sheriff and Korean and Vietnam war veterans. Under the proposal, the intersection of Auburn Road and Interstate 22 would memorialize late Lee County sheriff Harold Ray Presley. The proposed designation is the “Harold Ray Presley Memorial Interchange,” The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. Presley was shot and killed on July 6, 2001 during a search for a suspected kidnapper, Billy Ray Stone. A tip led Presley and a deputy to a home, where authorities said he was shot multiple times by Stone. Stone was also killed, and two deputies faced federal civil rights charges accusing them of stomping and beating Stone while he was handcuffed. The deputies were acquitted. Northern District Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley said the highway designation would be a fitting honor for his uncle, Harold Ray Presley. The portion of Interstate 22 between exits 81 and 87 would be designated as “Korean Veterans Highway,” and the section between exits 87 and 94 would be named “Vietnam Veterans Way.” The memorials require approval from the state Legislature.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:At least three members of a crowded Republican primary field for Missouri’s open U.S. Senate seat are set to appear on stage together in February. Springfield’s U.S. Rep. Billy Long will join U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey for the Missouri Republicans’ annual State Lincoln Days event in St. Charles, the party announced Thursday. Attorney General Eric Schmitt, former Gov. Eric Greitens and Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz have not yet confirmed they will attend the forum. The event will mark one of the first public appearances of multiple Republican candidates thus far in the race to replace Sen. Roy Blunt, who is not seeking re-election. It will be a “chance to hear from the ... candidates on the national issues and how they would represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate,” the party said. Democrats seeking their party’s nomination appeared in a November forum in Hillsboro.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana’s Public Service Commission districts, which have not been reapportioned in two decades, are likely unconstitutional, a federal judge has concluded. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy said in his order voters challenging the constitutionality of the districts were “likely – though not certain” to succeed in their lawsuit to have the districts redrawn before the 2022 election, the Billings Gazette reported. At issue is whether those districts violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires that political districts balance under the “one-person, one-vote rule” that allows a deviation of no more than 10% from the ideal population. The voters challenging the districts are former Montana Secretary of State Bob Brown of Flathead County, and Hailey Sinoff and Donald Seifert of Gallatin County. They have asked for a three-judge panel to do the redistricting that Montana’s Legislature has repeatedly tried and failed to do. Until the districts are brought into balance, the plaintiffs asked that Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen be stopped from certifying candidates for PSC elections in 2022.\n\nNebraska\n\nPapillion: A Nebraska man is recovering after falling through ice while saving his dog at a lake. The Omaha World-Herald reported the Papillion fire and police departments were called at 11:30 a.m. Friday after a 47-year-old man fell through the ice at Walnut Creek Lake. He was on the ice trying to rescue his dog, about 30 to 40 feet from shore. The man was able to rescue the dog, which walked back to shore, but in the process, the man fell through the ice. A Sarpy County deputy was in the area and arrived to assist the man using search-and-rescue equipment. Papillion Police Lt. Ray Higgins said bystanders estimated the man was in the water between 5 to 10 minutes before the deputy’s arrival. Higgins said the man was treated at the scene but opted not to go to a hospital.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As invasive plants encroach on the pristine waters of Lake Tahoe, officials are weighing whether to use aquatic herbicides for the first time to contain their growth and prevent them from clouding the water. Plants succh as curlyleaf pondweed and eurasian watermilfoil have long thrived in the Tahoe Keys, a boating community located on a lagoon off the southern end of the lake. The local property owners’ association said the methods it has historically used to contain weeds – including taking them out manually – are no longer sufficient. Along with some scientists and lake protection groups, they’re lobbying the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Governing Board and the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to permit herbicide use in the Keys. The League and the Tahoe Keys Property Owners’ Association are among a longer list of supporters of using herbicides to contain the invasive plants from spreading that also includes scientists at the Tahoe Environmental Research Center; University of California, Davis; the University of Nevada, Reno; and the Tahoe Resource Conservation District. They argued the weeds could harm lake clarity, inhibit boating and affect the rest of the lake’s ecosystem. They’re advocating for a trial program that would use UV light, manual weed extraction and herbicides to remove up to 75% of the invasive plants over a three-year period. Groups such as the Sierra Club, Friends of West Shore and the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance oppose herbicides, which have never been used in federally-protected Lake Tahoe or the Keys. A similar effort to introduce herbicides in 2015 was scuttled. Instead, they are pushing to wall off the Keys to contain the invasive plants and returning parts of the lagoon to the native marshland – an idea that property owners’ oppose.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Two brothers have their holiday regifting skills down to an art – they have been passing the same hard candy back and forth for more than 30 years. It started in 1987, when Ryan Wasson gave a 10-roll Frankford “Santa’s Candy Book” with assorted fruit flavors to his brother, Eric, as a joke for Christmas, knowing that Eric wouldn’t like it. “I didn’t eat them,” Eric told WMUR-TV. “And so the next year I thought, ‘Hey, I think I’m going to give it back to him. He’ll never remember.’ ” But Ryan immediately recognized it. They have been taking turns ever since, keeping a log of their exchanges. Ryan told the station the candy has been frozen in a block of ice and put in Jell-O, adding, “He one time sewed it into a teddy bear.” The tradition has also involved family members, co-workers and even a sheriff’s department. Last year, it was presented to Ryan on a silver platter at a restaurant. This year, Ryan turned to a group on social media for ideas. Suggestions included having it arrive via a pizza delivery or Christmas carolers, hiding it in a book or cake, or holding a scavenger hunt with clues.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has agreed to pay $53 million to the families of 119 seniors, most of whom died of COVID-19 at state-run veterans homes where questionable practices and poor decisions led to one of the nation’s highest nursing home death tolls during the pandemic, attorneys for the families said. The settlement would pay an average of $445,000 to each family. They had argued their loved ones became sick because of “gross departures” from nursing home standards and infection control at the homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland. “No amount of money can ever obviously replace the lives of the lost veterans, but my clients and I are satisfied that this settlement provides a good measure of civil justice,” said Paul da Costa, an attorney who represented 72 of the residents’ families. In all, 205 residents and two nursing aides died from COVID-19 at the three homes – the vast majority during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. Menlo Park had 103 resident deaths followed by Paramus with 89 and Vineland with 13.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Two servers at an Albuquerque restaurant recently got a big surprise when a group of business owners left a $5,555 tip. It was the idea of Battle Tested Business, a local entrepreneurship, business and leadership organization. Founder Ramon Casaus told Albuquerque television station KOB-TV that he and his colleagues are always looking for creative and meaningful ways to invest back into businesses and the people who keep them going. “We said, well, what if we all went to dinner and tip out $505 each?” Casaus said. They called it “The 505 Dinner” in reference to Albuquerque’s area code. Battle Tested Business said on its Facebook page that local restaurants and their staff were devastated during the pandemic and the group believes in the mission of helping in its backyard.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The Metropolitan Opera is requiring audience and employees to receive COVID-19 booster shots for entry starting Jan. 17. “With the news of the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant,” the Met said in an email to the company, “it is clear that we must now take additional steps to protect our community.” The company said anyone not yet eligible to receive a booster shot will be allowed a two-week grace period after they become eligible. The Met was closed from March 2020 until September because of the pandemic, canceling 276 performances plus an international tour. It has drawn approximately 160,000 for its first 59 performances this season, which runs until June. Average capacity has been 73%; ticket distribution has been limited to 3,700, down from 4,000, with the first few rows and standing room not sold. Up to 3,000 people are employed by the Met on performance days. “Our population is far larger than any other not-for-profit performing arts organization in the country, which is why we have to be in the vanguard of health and safety,” Met general manager Peter Gelb said in a statement. The company mandated vaccinations for employees last summer and has required proof of vaccination for the audience since the season began.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOakboro: A police chief has been placed on unpaid leave because he reportedly told officers about a “clinic” where they could get COVID-19 vaccination cards without being vaccinated. WBTV in Charlotte reported Oakboro Police Chief TJ Smith was put on leave for a two-week period that started Tuesday. The town is west of Charlotte in Stanly County Oakboro Town Administrator Doug Burgess wrote Smith a letter that informed him of the punishment. Burgess said the chief violated the town’s personnel policy, which bars acts of fraud, endangering the property of others and serving a conflicting interest. The town manager said anymore violations would lead to discipline, which could include dismissal. Smith said in a statement that he made a mistake. “I didn’t profit from it,” the chief said. “I couldn’t possibly profit from it, and I didn’t do it from a place of malice. I care deeply about others, and I sincerely appreciate that I have a job that allows me to serve them and to see things improve in my community.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Three Republican lawmakers representing the southwestern part of the state have announced their reelection campaigns. Reps. Jim Schmidt of Huff, Karen Rohr of Mandan and Sen. David Schaible of Mott will all run for a fourth time to return to the Capitol, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The lawmakers’ districts include part of Morton County and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. All three were first elected in 2010. Schaible is a farmer, chair of the Senate Education Committee and sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Schmidt, also a farmer, is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Rohr, a nurse practitioner, is a member of the House Human Services Committee and the House Government and Veterans Affairs Committee. Because of redistricting – the process in which state legislative districts are redrawn every 10 years using census data – 99 seats will be up for grabs in next year’s election, which is more than usual. Political parties are expected to hold their endorsing conventions for candidates early next year. Primaries are slated for June 14 with the general election set for Nov. 8.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Stuart Scheller, a former officer in the Marine Corps with ties to the Cincinnati area who received national attention after criticizing leaders over the pullout from Afghanistan, announced he has been discharged from the Marine Corps. Scheller stated he was let go from the Marine Corps on Thursday in a Facebook post. In August, Scheller, who went to Anderson High School and the University of Cincinnati, posted a video demanding accountability from senior leaders after an attack killed 13 U.S. service members in Kabul, Afghanistan. Soon after, he was relieved of his command. What followed was a series of videos and social media posts from Scheller violating a gag order. Scheller was then held in pretrial confinement at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonnville, North Carolina. Scheller ended his Facebook post by saying he is going on a media blitz, starting as a guest on the Fox News show “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Jan. 4.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The local police union has filed a grievance against the police department over its alleged implementation of new body-worn camera technology before agreeing upon procedure changes in the collective bargaining agreement. The Oklahoma City Police Department and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 123 were unable to agree on procedural changes brought on by the new cameras, as well as a proposal to stop showing body-cam footage to officers involved in a shooting before they are interviewed about the incident. The limit on viewing footage is one of 39 recommendations for the police department from the city-hired consultant 21CP Solutions. Police Chief Wade Gourley said the city and the union were close to an agreement on how the new technology – which includes upgrades to camera battery life and storage, new livestreaming and automatic activation capabilities and the addition of in-car cameras – would change the camera procedure until the 21CP-recommended change was brought into the negotiations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Efforts to fully assess a landslide blocking River Road South in Salem will have to wait. The road is expected to remain closed between Owens Street SE and Minto Island Road SE, the entrance to Minto-Brown Island Park, for several days, according to city officials. Officials said it’s not yet safe enough for teams to begin clearing debris that led to the closure or further assess the stability of the hillside. With snow and freezing temperatures expected early next week, the road could remain closed for seven to 10 days, the Statesman Journal reported. The city will prioritize clearing of detour routes in the area while the closure is in place. An early estimate put the amount of material that slid down at about 150 cubic yards, which is blocking the shoulder, northbound lane and spilling into the southbound lane, according to Courtney Knox Busch, a City of Salem spokesperson. No injuries were reported following the slide, which was first reported at about 2:30 a.m. Thursday. Croisan Creek Road S is the designated detour route.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Hundreds gathered on both sides of the Delaware River to watch an annual Christmas Day reenactment of George Washington’s 1776 crossing, a year after pandemic restrictions forced viewers to watch it online. Reenactors in three boats completed the crossing in about an hour Saturday afternoon under overcast skies but in fairly mild temperatures, a spokesperson for Washington Crossing Historic Park said. Earlier in the month, about 5,000 people attended a dress rehearsal of the Revolutionary War reenactment amid good weather and good water conditions, volunteer Tom Maddock of the Friends of Washington Crossing Park said, calling it “a great day.” In 2020, after crowd-size restrictions barred holding the traditional in-person event, park officials posted a video of a reenactment filmed earlier in the month providing what they called a “close-up view.” This year, people entering the visitor center were asked to wear masks, and workers were also masked, officials said. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A top public heath official is concerned that fewer than half of all eligible K-12 public school students in Rhode Island have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. According to the most recent available data on the state Department of Health’s website showing vaccination rates among all eligible public school students 5 years and older, 48% are partially vaccinated and 42% are fully vaccinated, WPRI-TV reported. As of Wednesday, about 74% of the state’s total population had been fully vaccinated, according to department data. “I’m concerned about, certainly, younger folks,” Dr. Philip Chan, consulting medical director for the department, told the station. He said although parents being concerned about the health of their children is “normal and reasonable,” the coronavirus vaccines “have been out for well over a year, we know that they’re safe and effective.” The lowest vaccination rates tend to be at elementary schools – where many students only recently became eligible. Chan also noted a disparity of higher vaccination rates at more affluent suburban schools and lower rates at schools in poorer urban areas. Younger people are less likely to become severely ill or die after contracting the virus, medical experts said, but the latest surge of infections in Rhode Island is hitting younger people the hardest.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: An environmental group has decided on the historical names Harriet and Mitch for two eagles that have become internet stars watching over their eggs in a nest on Hilton Head Island. A web camera was set up this fall after someone spotted the nest and called the Hilton Head Island Land Trust and state wildlife officials. California company HD on Tap set up the camera, which caught Harriet laying an egg on Nov. 19. She has since laid another and scientists expect the eggs to hatch in the next week or two, the land trust said. The trust isn’t releasing the location of the nest to protect the eagles from being bothered by humans. The eagles are named for two key figures in emancipating slaves in South Carolina and were picked by the trust from hundreds of suggestions. Harriet is named for Harriet Tubman, who helped slaves escape to the North before the Civil War on the Underground Railroad and served as a nurse and spy for the Union army in Beaufort County. Mitch is named for Union Army Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel, who founded the town of Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island during the Civil War. Freed slaves ran the town and provided education for its children decades before public schools were provided for all children. Harriet is larger than Mitch and spends most of her time sitting on her eggs. Mitch helps to protect the eggs from the weather and other predators.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nFlandreau: A bakery has shut its doors after 91 years in business. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported the owners of Flandreau Bakery closed up shop for the last time Friday. Mel Duncan opened the bakery in 1930 and worked there until he turned 90. His sons, Ed and Don, took over the business in 1981. Don is 71; Ed is 69. The brothers said they want to retire and relax. They had planned to close the bakery on New Year’s Eve but stepped up their timetable after Ed slipped on ice and broke his wrist following a Dec. 15 storm. Jeannie Manzer, 69, of Brookings went to school with the Duncans and always got her birthday cakes at the bakery. Mel Duncan also baked wedding cakes for her and her sisters. She had her husband stop by the bakery a few weeks ago to pick up what she described as “the world’s best peanut brittle.” The bakery’s mocha cake was so popular it was featured on the Food Network. Flandreau lies on the South Dakota-Minnesota border. It’s home to about 2,340 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Last Thursday, Memphis police reported 333 homicides, meaning the city has passed the grim record set in 2020 of 332 homicides. Of those 333 homicides this year – 292 are classified as murders. The remainder of the deaths fell into categories such as justified homicides or instances of negligent manslaughter. Within the record number included a subset of at least 29 peoople under 18 killed intentionally and through negligence. Shelby County’s top prosecutor, Amy Weirich and the city’s recently appointed Police Chief C.J. Davis have held community forums where they have explained the limitations of their roles and pleaded for more community involvement. New initiatives meant to relocate witnesses to a safe location away from any offender they report to police have been established. Within communities hardest hit by gun violence, pastors have encouraged their communities to stop protecting those that would take a life. And, grassroots organizations, such as Memphis Artists for Change, have started holding trauma-and-race informed de-escalation workshops.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The wife of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was arrested Christmas Eve on a domestic violence charge the right-wing provocateur said stems from a “medication imbalance.” Sheriff’s deputies took Erika Wulff Jones into custody and booked her into an Austin jail around 8:45 p.m. Friday. Jail records showed the 43-year-old faces misdemeanor charges of assault causing bodily injury to a family member and resisting arrest, search or transport. She had not received a bond as of Saturday afternoon. Alex Jones, an Austin resident and founder of the media group Infowars, declined Saturday to say whether he had been injured or elaborate on what happened beyond that he believes it was related to his wife’s recent change of medication. “It’s a private family matter that happened on Christmas Eve,” Jones told the Associated Press in a brief interview. “I love my wife and care about her and it appears to be some kind of medication imbalance.” The Travis County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request Christmas Day for the report on Wulff Jones’ arrest and a spokeswoman said she could not provide more information. An attorney for Wulff Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:A Utah school district is removing two books from libraries after a complaint from a parent. The Washington County School District in southern Utah will pull the award-winning books “Out of Darkness” and “The Hate U Give,” communications director Steven Dunham told KTVX. The first book will come off secondary school shelves and the second will be removed from elementary and intermediate schools. “Out of Darkness” follows a romantic relationship between two teenagers, a Mexican American girl and an African-American boy, in Texas in the 1930s. “The Hate U Give” follows a 16-year-old’s life after the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend at the hands of a police officer amid the Black Lives Matter movement. The decision came after committees reviewed the books and found profanity and sexually explicit content, Dunham said. He said the school recognizes parents’ rights, but hopes parents also recognize there are valuable lessons to be taken from the literature. Another Utah school district, the Canyons, removed several books to review them last month after an email complaint. Libraries across the country have seen increased calls to review or remove books from school libraries, part of a renewed conservative interest in public education as a political issue.\n\nVermont\n\nCharlotte: The state is helping ensure the town of Charlotte can keep its roads clear this winter after a fire destroyed most of the community’s snowplows. The Vermont Agency of Transportation is loaning the community three plows until the plows that were destroyed by the fire can be replaced. Charlotte, which has 60 miles of town roads, leases its plows through Lewis Excavating, the business operated by Charlotte’s elected road commissioner, Junior Lewis. Fire destroyed Lewis’ 70-year-old wooden storage facility on Church Hill Road on Wednesday, leaving four plow trucks along with other vehicles and gear unusable. Only one plow was saved. “This is the time you need that equipment,” said Charlotte Select Board Chair Jim Faulkner. The cause of the fire is uknown but not thought to be suspicious. There were no injuries. Gov. Phil Scott heard about the fire through news reports and asked the Agency of Transportation to help, said Transportation Secretary Joe Flynn said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The spot where a towering statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee once stood over Richmond’s tree-lined Monument Avenue is now just a pile of boulders, rubble and sand. But for the next few weeks, workers will continue their search for a famed 1887 time capsule that was said to be buried under the massive monument, long viewed as a symbol of racial injustice. “We know what to be on the lookout for,” said Devon Henry, the contractor who took down the statue and its pedestal. “It will be a very decorative piece of granite that will look nothing like what’s already there.” Henry spoke the day after one of the more anti-climactic moments in historic preservation: State conservators spent 5 hours gingerly prying open a corroded lead box that some believed – or at least hoped – was the 1887 time capsule. But they didn’t find the expected trove of objects related to the Confederacy, including a picture of a deceased President Abraham Lincoln. Instead, conservators pulled out a few waterlogged books, a silver coin and an envelope with some papers. The prevailing theory among some Thursday was that the lead box was left by a person – or persons – who oversaw the monument’s construction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle:Snow blanketed parts of the Pacific Northwest on Sunday because of unusually cold temperatures in the region. Between 3 and 5 inches of snow fell in Seattle overnight. Observers in Port Angeles, across the Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula, reported about 11 inches of snow. Another 2 to 5 inches of snow were expected to fall in parts of northwest and west-central Washington during the day, the National Weather Service said. “It’s cold enough for snow and there’s enough moisture around, so we have enough snow to see snowfall across the area,” National Weather Service Seattle meteorologist Jacob DeFlitch told The Seattle Times. Frigid temperatures in the region could tie or break records in the coming days. The Seattle area is expected to dip as low as 18 degrees F, the lowest in several years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: Construction is expected to begin Monday on a FedEx Ground distribution center in south Parkersburg, according to a published report. A 250,000-square-foot facility is planned to be operational at the site in 2022, The Parkersburg News and Sentinel reported. It will employ a mix of full- and part-time workers and also will contract for package pickup and delivery services, FedEx Ground spokesman David Westrick told the newspaper. The company is working to optimize its capacity to meet increasing demand as e-commerce grows, Westrick said. “The site was chosen because of its ease of access to major highways, proximity to customers’ distribution centers and a strong local community workforce for recruiting employees,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Officials plan to take down a temporary memorial honoring people killed and injured after a man drove an SUV through the city’s Christmas parade last month. The city plans to remove the memorial at Waukesha’s Veterans Park on Wednesday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The memorial includes six crosses, flowers, candles, teddy bears and baseballs to honor 8-year-old Jackson Sparks, who was killed as he marched with his youth baseball team in the parade. City staff and the Waukesha County Historical Society will collect the items and preserve them. The Waukesha Common Council plans to consider a request on Jan. 18 to create a permanent memorial planning commission. Six people were killed and more than 60 hurt as the driver swerved the SUV through the parade in downtown Waukesha on Nov. 21. Prosecutors said Darrell Brooks was behind the wheel. His motives remain a mystery. He faces six counts of homicide and is being held on $5 million bail. Brooks was released from the Milwaukee County jail on $1,000 bail just days before the parade. He had been arrested for allegedly running over the mother of his child with the same SUV.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Researchers are investigating whether limiting the number of bighorn sheep – and, consequently, limiting the amount the herd’s members can compete with one another for food – would prevent another pneumonia-driven die-off that killed 40% of the Jackson herd in 2012. To do that, they’re considering asking if the public would support a ewe hunt. “The hypothesis is, if we can reduce numbers through hunting, we should see those sheep respond with better body conditions,” Courtemanch said. “That’ll be one of the first times, if not the first time, that’s ever been done.” But it’s unknown what such a hunt would look like. Although cow elk are hunted every fall to manage herd numbers, bighorn sheep management is different. The sheep exist in far fewer numbers than elk across the Mountain West and hunting tags are usually limited to rams – and generally scarce. There were only 12 tags issued in 2021 for male bighorns in the Gros Ventre-dwelling Jackson Herd. And Courtemanch said a ewe hunt has been authorized only once in Wyoming and rarely in other parts of the West. So it’s a relatively new tool. Game and Fish plans to make a more detailed proposal, including how many tags might be offered, in March. An open house and chance for public comment would precede sending a proposal to the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission for approval in April.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/25/whiskey-webs-alien-abductions-goldfish-invasion-news-around-states/39619731/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Preservationists are trying to save a more than 200-year-old site in southwest Alabama that was once both a military installation and a hospital. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has recognized the Mount Vernon Arsenal and Searcy Hospital as one of the nation’s most endangered places. Officials are trying to develop a plan and raise money to save the area, located north of Mobile. The arsenal was established in the early 1800s, and many of those buildings remain. Apache leaders including Geronimo were interred there in the late 1800s. The facility became a mental hospital for African Americans in 1900s when Alabama was racially segregated by law. It was integrated decades later and closed in 2012. About 40 buildings remain at the site, but many are deteriorating.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials are making plans to deal with an invasive species at a pond in the middle of the city. The Anchorage Daily News reports more than 150 orange, white and red goldfish are swimming in Cuddy Pond near the city’s main library. The aquarium pets are domesticated carp originally bred in China. Goldfish can carry diseases and bacteria that harm the ecosystem and other marine animals. Alaska Department of Fish and Game invasive species research biologist Krissy Dunker says the department last year tried using electroshock equipment to stun fish and make them easier to catch. She says the fish simply swam deeper. Dunker says it’s more humane to euthanize unwanted pet fish than to release them into the wild, where they’re likely to starve in winter.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inspectors with the state School Facilities Board once identified critical problems at schools during inspections – high carbon dioxide levels in one school’s classrooms, a 50-year-old air-conditioning system in another school, fire alarm systems in need of repair. But those inspections are almost extinct. Since 2017, officials have conducted just one inspection of one school. State law requires that the School Facilities Board inspect all district school buildings once every five years for building deficiencies and conduct preventive maintenance inspections at 20 randomly selected districts every 30 months. Arizona has 2,001 district school buildings, according to the state Department of Education. Officials conducted 20 deficiencies inspections in 2015 and 18 in 2016. They did no inspections in 2017 and 2018 and one in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River park has been designated as the state’s first International Dark Sky Park. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that park officials spent two years getting 345 light fixtures into compliance. It recently became the world’s 71st dark sky park. Mark Foust, who heads the park, says he hopes the designation can serve as an example for other parks in the region that want to partake in the process. The park stretches along 135 miles of the Buffalo River. Park ranger Cassandra Johannsen says most of the 1.2 million visitors go to float the river, but she has encountered people who visit exclusively for the night sky. Bruce McMath, chairman of the Arkansas Natural Sky Association, says park rangers and amateur astronomers have developed impressive dark-sky programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A floating device designed to catch plastic waste has been redeployed in its second attempt to clean up a huge island of trash swirling in the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. Boyan Slat, creator of The Ocean Cleanup project, announced on Twitter that a 2,000-foot-long floating boom that broke apart late last year was sent back to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch last week after four months of repair. A ship towed the U-shaped barrier from San Francisco to the patch in September to trap the plastic. But during the four months at sea, the boom broke apart under constant waves and wind, and the boom wasn’t retaining the plastic it caught. Fitted with solar-powered lights, cameras, sensors and satellite antennas, the device intends to communicate its position at all times, allowing a support vessel to fish out the collected plastic every few months and transport it to dry land.\n\nColorado\n\nManitou Springs: A Coloradan is trying to break a record for hiking a notoriously steep and difficult trail as many times as he can in a year. The current record is 1,719 ascents of the Manitou Incline near Manitou Springs. The Colorado Springs Gazette reports 62-year-old Greg Cummings is now about halfway toward breaking his friend Roger Austin’s record. Cummings is averaging over five ascents and descents a day and has completed the trail about 870 times since January. The trail is short but climbs nearly 2,000 feet in less than a mile. The trail consists almost entirely of hundreds of steep steps up a mountainside. Cummings says the challenge is especially difficult because he has Type 1 diabetes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A Yale University library will display a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence and hold a public reading to mark the 243rd anniversary of the nation’s founding. The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library says the document is one of only 26 known copies of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence. Those copies are known as the Dunlap Broadside, named after John Dunlap, who printed about 200 copies in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. They were distributed to the original 13 states. The Yale copy will be displayed in a temporary exhibition case at the library from June 27 through July 11, except for the July 4 holiday, when the library will be closed. The public reading is scheduled for July 5 at 4 p.m.\n\nDelaware\n\nPrices Corner: Calling attention to what has been described as “a violent and often-ignored chapter of Delaware history,” legislators and more than 100 community members gathered Sunday to unveil a historical marker commemorating the only documented lynching in the First State. Installed by the Delaware Public Archives at New Castle County’s Greenbank Park in Prices Corner, the marker memorializes the 1903 lynching of laborer George White at the hands of a white mob. He was burned at the stake, according to historical accounts and newspaper archives. “I don’t think he’s ever going to be forgotten,” said Savannah Shepherd, a rising senior at the Sanford School in Hockessin, standing in front of a tower that is all that remains of the New Castle County workhouse White where was imprisoned before his death. The high schooler was instrumental in getting the memorial put up.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The 2018 Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals are among 11 new entrants into the district’s Sports Hall of Fame. The Capitals earned entry after bringing the National Hockey League title to Washington for the first time. Owner Ted Leonsis accepted the induction plaque in a ceremony Sunday at Nationals Park. Other honorees included former Redskins defensive end Charles Mann; Tom Brown, who played for the Senators and Redskins; University of Maryland women’s lacrosse coach Cathy Reese; former DeMatha Catholic High School and Duke basketball player Danny Ferry; Maryland soccer coach Sasho Cirovski; two-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Tom Dolan; horse racing writer Andrew Beyer; and Kevin Payne, first president and CEO of DC United (soccer).\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A woman’s effort to protect herself from domestic violence has become a flashpoint in the debate over gun rights and victims’ safety. Courtney Irby gave her estranged husband’s guns to police after he was charged with domestic violence-aggravated battery, only to find herself arrested for theft. Now a state lawmaker and gun safety advocates are championing her cause, asking a state attorney to drop the charges, while gun rights advocates want her prosecuted. Irby spent six days in jail on charges of armed burglary and grand theft. At the time she turned in the assault rifle and handgun, Joseph Irby was spending one day in jail, accused of ramming into her car after a divorce hearing. She had received a temporary injunction for protection. Federal law prohibits people under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing guns, but it’s up to local law enforcement to enforce it, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A hand-painted silk flag carried into battle by members of the 127th United States Colored Troops in the Civil War now has a home at a museum in the city. The piece of history recently auctioned off in Philadelphia landed in the collection of the Atlanta History Center and is the most expensive artifact the center has acquired. According to the center, at least 180,000 African Americans served in the United States Colored Troops, a branch of the U.S. Army formed after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. The units were segregated and commanded by white officers. Estimates are that three-fourths of the soldiers were formerly enslaved men. The history center has 11,000 items in its Civil War collection, which is one of the largest in the nation. But items specifically associated with the U.S. Colored Troops are very rare, and the center owns only a dozen.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A new altar has been built near the summit of Mauna Kea, less than a day after state officials dismantled two other “ahu” in preparation for the construction of one of the world’s most advanced telescopes. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the new ahu isn’t directly blocking access to the site where the Thirty Meter Telescope is planned. The two dismantled ahu were blocking access to the site. The new ahu is across the road from the Maunakea Visitor Information Station where a structure called Hale o Kukiaimauna stood until state officials took it down Thursday. State officials announced they were giving permission for construction to begin on the Thirty Meter Telescope. The decision came after the state Supreme Court in October upheld the project’s permits.\n\nIdaho\n\nKelly Creek: Wildlife officials are urging black bear hunters to choose their targets with care after a protected grizzly bear was spotted in north-central Idaho for the first time in a decade. A hunting guide restocking a black bear baiting site encountered the 3-year-old male grizzly in the lower Kelly Creek area of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests this month. The grizzly bear is collared and tracked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency says the bear crossed into Idaho last August, but wildlife officials captured it and sent it back to Montana. Wayne Kasworm, who monitors bears for the agency, says the bear headed south again after it was released. Idaho Fish and Game officials say hunters need to be cautious for the rest of black bear season.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: State troopers are teaming up with truck drivers in the Chicago area to crack down on distracted driving. The (Joliet) Herald-News reports the “Trooper in a Truck” program has troopers riding along in the cabs of commercial motor vehicles to better spot distracted drivers. Maj. Robert Meeder says troopers have a better vantage point from a truck’s cab to see if drivers in other vehicles are texting or doing other things that are unsafe. If the trooper sees something, he or she notifies police units up ahead to stop the violators. Meeder said during a news conference in Joliet that distracted driving is a leading cause of traffic crashes.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The region’s archbishop has forced a Catholic high school to fire a gay teacher, just days after another school in the city defied a similar order despite church officials saying they would no longer recognize it as Catholic. Cathedral High School announced Sunday that it’s terminating the teacher’s contract to avoid a split with the Indianapolis archdiocese. Leaders of Cathedral High School, a private school affiliated with the Brothers of the Holy Cross religious order, said in a letter on the school’s website that disobeying Archbishop Charles Thompson would cost the school its nonprofit status and its ability to have Mass celebrated on campus. This is the third Indianapolis Catholic high school that’s faced pressure from Thompson over employees in same-sex marriages since he became archbishop in July 2017.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A University of Iowa team has won a $115million grant to develop satellites for studying a system of radiation created by the sun – “space weather.” The NASA grant will underwrite development of satellites expected to be launched within the next three years with more satellites developed by Southwest Research Institute scientists. The satellites are designed to gather data on how the sun creates solar wind and how Earth responds to the solar wind. NASA scientists say goal is to understand what drives space weather so humans can mitigate any harmful effects. NASA official Nicky Fox says solar particles generated by the sun can interfere with undersea cables, power grids, radio communications and other electronic equipment.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are raising pay and fast-tracking various teaching professionals in a two-pronged effort aimed at combating teacher shortages. Last year, Kansas schools had more than 600 vacant positions, many in rural areas and the state’s most urban districts. Low pay has been blamed for much of the trouble attracting and retaining teachers. Legislative approval of multiyear school funding increases amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars has given districts a chance to offer teacher raises that were difficult to include in previous budgets, the Kansas News Service reports. Fast-tracking teaching assistants and other professionals to head classrooms is the other part of the plan. Education officials say they believe the upcoming funding boost will alleviate teacher shortages.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: University of Louisville professor Stuart Williams was experimenting with a case of bourbon when he made an accidental discovery – a drop of the spirit, when diluted and evaporated under certain conditions, formed a microscopic pattern of thin strands. Williams calls the pattern a “whiskey web,” which looks like a lattice of lightning when it’s lit up. And he believes it may prove to be a unique “fingerprint” that can be used to identify different bourbons, although his research is still in the early stages. Thousands of flavors contribute to the taste of a bourbon, Williams says, and he believes the physical components that make up those flavors, such as fatty acids, are primarily responsible for generating these webs. Only American whiskeys, which are aged in a new, charred barrel, appear to create these webs, based on the research so far, he says.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new federally led study of oil seeping from a platform toppled off Louisiana’s coast 14 1/ 2 years ago finds releases lower than other recent estimates but contradicts the well owner’s assertions about the amount and source of oil. Oil and gas have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since a subsea mudslide caused by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, knocked over a Taylor Energy Co. production platform. Taylor is fighting a federal order to cap the well. The company says oil sheens on the water’s surface indicate there’s only a dribble of oil. The new report says its findings contradict that. The scientists used sonar and a new tool they call a “bubblometer” to estimate the seepage. Taylor says it wants verifiable scientific data about the leak and a scientifically and environmentally sound solution.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: City officials are waiting on a decision from the state about whether new African immigrants here can receive state assistance. The Portland Press Herald reports the Portland City Council canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday to discuss financial support for the asylum-seekers. Mayor Ethan Strimling says the city postponed the meeting to give Gov. Janet Mills more time. More than 200 people were staying at an emergency shelter in Portland late last week. Most are from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and they’re seeking asylum in the United States. City Manager Jon Jennings says the number of immigrants arriving in the city seems to have stabilized in recent days. They’re staying at a basketball arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Assateague Island welcomed new life Friday with the birth of a wild horse. “Ms. Macky,” also known as N2BHS-AL, gave birth to a male bay pinto colt. “The new foal, N2BHS-ALR, and band live most of the year in the very busy developed area and campgrounds. For this reason, the National Park Service expressly reminds visitors that it is essential to remain a minimum of a bus length (40’) away from the wild horses at all times,” the National Park Service said in a release. About two-thirds of foals in the Assateague Island National Seashore are born in April, May and June. “A mare will be very protective of her new foal and it is vitally important for their well-being that visitors give them, and all of the wild horses, plenty of space,” the release said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Researchers on Cape Cod are launching a new study focused on the hunting and feeding habits of the region’s great white sharks following last year’s two attacks on humans. Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist leading the effort, says the hope is to contribute critical information to the ongoing debate over how to keep Cape beachgoers safe. The new research calls for placing sophisticated tags on sharks to track their swimming speed, depth and body position in the water. Skomal says researchers also hope to determine how many seals great whites are eating and whether that’s affecting the seal population. Local officials have been wrestling for months with how to respond to public concern over last year’s attacks, which included the state’s first shark-related fatality in more than 80 years.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: State officials are questioning whether crews digging water service lines in the city near an American Indian burial ground found human remains after an inspector found work was being conducted without an archaeologist. The Flint Journal reports the inquiry came in a June 18 letter from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to Flint Public Works Director Robert Bincsik. The work appears to have been done without required professional oversight, violating an agreement among the state, Flint and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. The letter asks for details and plans for future work. City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt says no human remains were found, and the city is seeking an archaeologist so excavation can continue.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Starting July 1, Minnesotans who rape their spouses finally can be charged with sexual assault. Wage theft becomes a crime. And drug manufacturers will help shoulder the costs of the opioid epidemic. Those are some new laws taking effect July 1 along with the state’s new $48 billion budget. Minnesota will have what sponsors say is the country’s toughest wage theft law. It comes down hard on employers who cheat workers by making it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. An estimated 39,000 Minnesotans annually are victims of wage theft in some form. Drug manufacturers and distributors will now have to pay much higher registration fees, which will raise about $21 million annually to help fight the opioid epidemic in the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A historical marker has been placed near the river where two men in southern Mississippi said they were abducted by aliens in 1973. News outlets report the city of Pascagoula dedicated the marker Saturday at Lighthouse Park. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker said they were on the shores of the Pascagoula River when what appeared to be aliens pulled them onboard a UFO, examined them for about 30 minutes and then returned them to Earth. Both reported the event to the sheriff’s department and were checked out at a hospital after it happened Oct. 11, 1973. The story has become known worldwide. Parker published a book about the experience in 2018. Hickson died in 2011. Both said many people doubted their story. A few witnesses have come forward to corroborate some details.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A judge ruled Monday that the state’s lone abortion clinic can continue performing abortions through Friday but kicked the clinic’s lawsuit out of court. St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued in order to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the city time to take a licensing fight before an administrative panel. Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Rail Link has been awarded a $3.5 million federal grant to design a safety system for a railway between southern Montana and northern Idaho. The Billings Gazette reports the Federal Rail Administration grant will fund the design and environmental review of implementing a positive train control, an automated system to stop a train before a crash. The safety system would be designed to identify potential problems and warn train operators. It would stop the train if the operator doesn’t act. Montana Rail Link aims to install the system on the 655-mile line running from near Billings to Sandpoint, Idaho. The grant was awarded under the federal Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program and the Special Transportation Circumstances Program.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Visitors to Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium can now see two newborn sea lion pups in the zoo’s Sea Lion Pavilion. The first pup was born June 12 to 9-year-old Gemini. Another was born Tuesday to 10-year-old Coco. The sexes of the pups are not yet known. The sea lion pups and their mothers are on display with the father of both pups, 15-year-old Chino. The zoo currently has eight sea lions: two males, four females and the two pups. Next year, the zoo is set to open Owen Sea Lion Shores, a new sea lion habitat that will include underwater viewing. The area also will include a natural beach that will allow females to give birth on land and gradually introduce pups to the water, as they would in their natural habitats.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Eldorado Resorts will buy Caesars in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $17.3 billion, creating a casino giant. The acquisition Monday puts about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name, one of the biggest gambling and entertainment ventures in the United States. “Together, we will have an extremely powerful suite of iconic gaming and entertainment brands, as well as valuable strategic alliances with industry leaders in sports betting and online gaming,” Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg said in a statement. The company, which will be called Caesars, will be led by Reeg, along with Eldorado Chairman Gary Carano. It will be based in Reno, where Eldorado is based, with a “significant corporate presence” in Las Vegas, where Caesars is based.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is going to help residents who want to support the state’s pollinators by creating wildflower meadows. The university says pollinators such as bees are critical for New England’s fruit and vegetable crops, and residents have the ability to help by enhancing local habitats. The university is hosting a free event on the subject July 30 at the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station’s Woodman Horticultural Research Farm in Durham. The university says the state has a diverse set of native bees, but habitat loss is a threat to the pollinators. Cathy Neal, a researcher with the agricultural experiment station, says hundreds of pollinator gardens and habitats have been installed in the Granite State in recent years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMorris County: A photo of a 3-year-old lab mix as he sat beside his recently deceased owner’s empty hospital bed went viral and resulted in his adoption. The dog named Moose was photographed waiting for his owner to return to the hospital bed, apparently unaware he had died, according to a post on the Eleventh Hour Rescue’s Facebook page. Moose was returned to the county-based shelter and its Randolph kennels, where his new family found him. “MOOSE HAS BEEN ADOPTED by a wonderful family who will care for and love him for the rest of his life!” Eleventh Hour Rescue said in the social media post. “Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts! We wish all of our dogs had the same chance at finding a home as Moose does now!”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A longtime advocate and employee of the University of New Mexico University Libraries is donating his collection of rare George Orwell books. The university says professor and curator emeritus Russ Davidson has agreed to donate his Orwell book collection, which includes first editions of “Animal Farm” and “1984” in various languages. Davidson’s extensive collection also includes scarce editions of many of Orwell’s other books, essays and journalistic writings. The collection will be part of an Orwell exhibit in Zimmerman Library from September through next spring. Davidson worked at University Libraries for 25 years. The British-born Orwell was known for his allegorical novella “Animal Farm” and dystopian novel “1984,” both of which tackled totalitarianism. “1984” has become a best-seller in the U.S. again during the Trump administration.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: During Pride month, “somewhere over the rainbow” means crossing the street – over the multicolored crosswalk leading to the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. On Saturday evening, crews from the city’s Department of Transportation painted the pedestrian crossing closest to Stonewall, at Christopher Street and Seventh Avenue, in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. That pavement was hardly celebratory 50 years ago, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, when a police raid on Stonewall touched off riots that inspired the global Pride movement. The Stonewall Inn is now part of a national monument honoring LGBTQ civil rights. Embedded in the epoxy base of the new Village crosswalk are U.S. pennies from 1969, along with a Stonewall 50 logo enamel pin.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTrenton: Nine months after Hurricane Florence inundated the state, communities such as this one illustrate the slow and uneven pace of recovery. With hurricane season starting June 1, the courthouse and jail have yet to reopen as judges hear cases in an office building and inmates are housed in another county. Dozens are seeking federal buyouts of ruined homes, threatening Trenton’s tax base. Even the mayor has yet to move back into her house, due to a shortage of available construction workers. The county also lacks a newspaper or television station to help tell its story. But several residents say that charities have helped spread the word and have done work to get them moved back in, offering hope. The September 2018 hurricane turned downtown into a shallow lake of muddy water, flooding 106 homes – all but about 20 of the town’s households, town officials say.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The Ralph Engelstad Arena at the University of North Dakota is preparing to unveil what it calls the largest video display in college hockey, a 50,000-pound scoreboard manufactured by South Dakota-based Daktronics. The Engelstad Family Foundation, which has been at odds with recently departed school president Mark Kennedy over a basketball floor logo and other issues, has donated $4 million for the $6 million project. The remaining $2 million is coming out of the building’s long-term repair and building fund. Arena manager Jody Hodgson says the idea to upgrade the video display was suggested by foundation trustee Kris Engelstad McGarry about a year and a half ago. Hodgson says the four 34-foot-wide by 15.5-foot-high video boards complement “the original vision” of Ralph Engelstad, a former North Dakota hockey player.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: BalloonFest is back. The 29th annual extravaganza will be held at Ashland’s Freer Field from Thursday through Saturday. Mindi White, president of Ashland BalloonFest, says 30 hot air balloons are scheduled to be part of this year’s festivities. Food vendors will open at 4 p.m. Thursday, though opening ceremonies won’t happen until 6:15 p.m. on the main stage. The media flight is scheduled to follow at 6:30. The first of three balloon glows will take place at 9:15. All flights will be dependent on the weather. Balloon glows will take place at the same time Friday and Saturday. Saturday’s balloon glow has been named in honor of John Moran, who had taken part in 23 BalloonFests and died at last year’s event when he hit his head on burners while disassembling his balloon.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Drivers who owe fines and fees for traffic violations will be able to settle for pennies on the dollar under an amnesty program approved by the City Council. Beginning July 1, drivers whose citations were issued at least two years ago will have until March 31 to resolve them. People who can’t pay their fines and fees could have their costs waived. People who have dragged their feet to pay a basic traffic ticket or show up for court will be able to settle for $155, a reduction from $613. The cost of the same ticket for someone who pays on time is $172. Officials say the program could help resolve more than 116,000 outstanding cases and help people with suspended driver’s licenses to get them back.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A law passed by the Legislature gives farmers and ranchers immunity from liability while fighting dangerous wildfires, such as the one that chewed through acres of wheat fields and grasslands last year, The Capitol Press reports. The law is similar to one that prevents bystanders from being sued if they try to help during an emergency, according to the newspaper. Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill last week at a ceremony with the Oregon Wheat Growers League. Wheat farmers were the first to respond to the rapidly spreading fire and used their disc plows and water trucks to slow it down before any firefighters arrived. The blaze destroyed 122 square miles of dry wheat fields and grasslands and was devastating for wheat farmers. Its sponsor, Sen. Bill Hansell, R-Athena, says the farmers who used their plows to create dirt firebreaks around homes and small communities were critical in slowing the flames.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers say a just-unveiled compromise budget package won’t include any extra money for the state to bolster federal census efforts. House Republican officials said Monday that there’s no need for the state to help fund a federal government function. A commission tapped by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf to study how to ensure an accurate census in Pennsylvania had asked for $1 per person to aid the outreach, or close to $13 million. Some states are undertaking a similar analysis and, in some cases, devoting money to the cause. The government takes a headcount every 10 years to allocate seats in Congress and billions in federal dollars for such things as transportation projects and education. Wolf’s office says the state would lose almost $2,100 a year for each person who isn’t counted.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: A company specializing in wind power blade maintenance has chosen the state for its U.S. headquarters, a sign of Rhode Island’s growing offshore wind industry. Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor told the Boston Globe last week that British company GEV Wind Power has committed to staying at Quonset Point in North Kingstown for at least 12 years. The company plans to create 125 jobs in the state. Pryor says he traveled to the United Kingdom twice in recent months to secure the deal. Pryor acknowledged that Massachusetts is building its role in the wind power industry but says Rhode Island is the “first mover” in this field. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp. was scheduled to vote Monday on a $1.9 million tax credit for GEV.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This year, the Confederate flag won’t temporarily be raised at the Statehouse to mark the day it was permanently taken down. A group calling for racial fairness – Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia – has a permit to rally on the grounds July 10. The South Carolina Secessionist Party has raised a Confederate flag on a temporary flagpole the past three years to protest the date the rebel banner was permanently removed. Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia founder Sarah Keeling told The State newspaper she applied for the permit the minute it was available so the Secessionist Party couldn’t gather. Officials review requests to hold events partly to prevent conflicts with other groups. The Secessionist Party might not have shown up because the group has splintered.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Arc of Dreams is changing the city’s skyline. And once it’s standing, the massive art piece that will be SculptureWalk’s staple art piece downtown itself will change from day to day thanks to an illumination system at the base of each side of the arc. The arc is equipped with 18 high-powered LED bulbs – nine on each side – that will splash color onto the steel structure from the ground up. In each bulb are red, white, green and blue diodes, which can be mixed and matched to create any number of colors. The lights are connected to digital software that will give SculptureWalk the ability to schedule color changes and even create the look of movement by rapidly changing colors that are splashing up and down the arc.\n\nTennessee\n\nMartin: A couple is donating $22 million to provide scholarships at the University of Tennessee-Martin, marking the largest gift in campus history. A news release says the gift by Bill and Rosann Nunnelly was announced during the University of Tennessee’s board meeting Friday. The donation will occur after the Nunnellys’ deaths, although four Hickman County students will begin receiving scholarships this fall. Dickson, Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, Maury and Humphreys county students could qualify for future scholarships. More than 90 scholarships could be awarded annually. Bill Nunnelly was raised on a farm in the Hickman County community bearing his family’s name. The semi-retired entrepreneur earned an undergraduate degree from UT Martin in 1970.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A worldwide sailing competition has returned to the city this week as the 2019 CITGO Etchells World Championship Regatta is contested on Corpus Christi Bay. The weeklong event will feature nearly 120 sailors from across the world, competing for the coveted championship trophy. Racing begins at noon Tuesday and is at the same time each day through Saturday. The Etchells sailboat traces it roots back to the 1950s, when E.W. “Skip” Etchells designed a boat for a yachting magazine competition to find a new three-man Olympic keelboat. The design lost out to the “Soling” for the Olympics but took hold in other sailing competitions. The boat is just over 30 feet long and has a main sail area of 188 square feet. It is considered one of the most popular competition boats in the world.\n\nUtah\n\nWest Haven: As the state’s population booms, some farmers in Weber County are making the tough but sometimes lucrative decision to sell their land as small family plots give way to homes. The Standard-Examiner reports that Phil Green is among Ogden-area farmers who recently sold land to housing developers. Green sold 56 acres that his family used for a dairy farm and to grow hay and corn. Today, more than 100 new houses fill that land. Green says it was hard to let the land go, and he sometimes cries when he walks through the subdivision. But he’s also glad he had the opportunity to sell. Weber County Commissioner Scott Jenkins says selling the land is sometimes a no-brainer for farmers struggling to make profits working the land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is looking for volunteers to count bats this summer. The department says the little brown bat is endangered in the state, and long-term volunteer monitoring is critical to its management and recovery. It’s holding a training session for volunteers next week in Fair Haven. The little brown bat population has declined by up to 90% in Vermont. Volunteer citizen scientists help by monitoring rare colonies of female bats and their young. State biologist Alyssa Bennett says the state has shown that the small surviving population appears to be holding steady. The free presentation and training will be held Friday at Bomoseen State Park from 8 p.m. to after dusk. Afterward, volunteers will be given sites to monitor.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia is considering a petition to remove a statue of a Revolutionary War hero because it depicts a potential attack on Native Americans. The Daily Progress reports that the school’s segregation commission is considering a petition to remove a statue of George Rogers Clark from campus that shows him and his soldiers possibly about to attack a group of Native Americans. The statue calls Clark the “Conqueror of the Northwest” and was given to the school in the 1920s. Clark led a militia that fought the British and their Native American allies during the Revolutionary War. In 1779 he routed the British from Fort Sackville in the Battle of Vincennes in present-day Indiana. He is the brother of William Clark, who co-led the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Wind is damaging the state’s cherry crop, but how much is not yet known. “Some say significant, but we won’t know until it runs over the line,” said B.J. Thurlby, president of Northwest Cherry Growers in Yakima, referring to when wind-damaged fruit reaches packing lines. Before winds reaching 35 mph hit the area last Wednesday, up to 90% of cherries were being packed, which is an excellent rate, Thurlby told the Capital Press. That percentage will probably drop. Wind bangs cherries around, bruising them as they hit or rub branches, leaves and other cherries. The riper the fruit, the more susceptible to damage they are. Rainiers bruise more easily than dark cherries. A lighter crop helps in some areas because clusters aren’t so tight, putting cherries in constant contact with each other.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The leader of the state’s Republican Party is applauding a state senator’s call for intolerance against members of the LGBTQ community. Republican state Sen. Mike Azinger wrote an opinion article Sunday titled “The Shame of LGBTQ Pride” in The Parkersburg News and Sentinel after the paper covered a gay pride picnic. State GOP chairwoman Melody Potter then wrote on Facebook that Azinger’s article was “right on.” Azinger wrote that “sexual deviancy is going mainstream” and said the solution “is not political correctness and tolerance.” Azinger says he’s taking a biblical position. Potter did not return a call to her office. Andrew Schneider, executive director of the advocacy group Fairness West Virginia, says Potter and Azinger are forgetting their scripture when it comes to loving others.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is setting up a new marker recognizing the campus as the ancestral home of the Ho-Chunk tribe. The university announced Monday that UW-Madison leaders and Ho-Chunk Nation officials dedicated the plaque on Bascom Hill on Thursday. The marker is entitled “Our Shared Future” and acknowledges the campus occupies ancestral Ho-Chunk land, a place the tribe called Teejop. The marker notes the tribe was forced to give up the territory in 1832. The plaque says both the federal and state government tried unsuccessfully to force the tribe out of Wisconsin, but UW-Madison recognizes the Ho-Chunk Nation’s sovereignty, as well as the sovereignty of the other 11 tribes that reside in the state. The marker will be part of all prospective student tours.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A national park and a nonprofit group plan to spend $8 million to improve boating facilities and address environmental damage along the Snake River in western Wyoming. The Snake River Gateways campaign is a joint effort between Grand Teton National Park and the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. The project will focus on boat launches and landings near Moose, Pacific Creek and Jackson Lake Dam. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports plans call for adding shelter for visitors at the busy landing site at Moose. The boat ramp at Pacific Creek will be replaced, and a nearby parking area will be reconfigured. The Jackson Lake Dam site will also get a new boat ramp and parking area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/04/can-crown-basilica-declaration-landfill-park-news-around-states/111392984/", "title": "Can-Am Crown, basilica declaration: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Some civic and political groups are urging Huntsville-area officials to stop criminally charging people who have marijuana. The Huntsville Times reports the Tennessee Valley Progressive Alliance and 20 other groups sent a letter to Huntsville and Madison County leaders urging police and prosecutors to stop enforcing laws against marijuana possession. The letter argues that stopping enforcement would ease racial disparities in policing, allow officials to focus on violent crimes and improve police-community relations. Signers included the Madison County Democratic Party, the NAACP of Huntsville and Madison County, and the League of Women Voters of the Tennessee Valley. Alliance leader David Odom says the letter received no responses. Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said he dismissed the letter because he’s sworn to uphold the law.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State taxes on motor and marine fuels would double and registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles would rise under a bill passed by the Alaska Senate on Monday. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Click Bishop, said the measure would generate additional funds that could help address transportation infrastructure and maintenance needs. The motor fuel tax would go from 8 to 16 cents a gallon and marine fuel from 5 to 10 cents a gallon. Registration fees would go from $100 to $200 for electric vehicles and from $100 to $150 for hybrids, according to a fiscal analysis. The bill passed 12-5; no one who voted against it spoke during the floor debate. The measure next goes to the House.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The biggest bonuses awarded last year by state government went to a handful of employees who oversee some of Arizona’s lowest-paid workers. Seven employees of Arizona Correctional Industries, a prison work program, received bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $57,000, with the largest going to a sales representative for the operation. Inmates who work in construction, egg harvesting and other jobs for ACI, meanwhile, are paid between $0.10 and $5.25 an hour. Corrections spokesman Bill Lamoreaux said ACI employee bonuses are paid by the private employers who use ACI to hire inmates, not taxpayers. Records show at least 52 Corrections employees associated with ACI received $384,221 in bonuses last year, averaging $7,389 – more than five times the average incentive pay for the 16,000 state employees who received bonuses in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: A local man who served in the U.S. Army during World War II was awarded the medals he earned during the war during a ceremony Friday morning, more than 70 years after his discharge. Fulton Walker, now 97, who went on to earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree and was the second African American to be appointed principal at an all-white school in Arkansas, received the Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, World War II Victory Medal, Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar and Honorable Service Lapel Button World War II from U.S. Sen. John Boozman. Walker was born Sept. 1, 1923, near Emerson. During his freshman year in college, he was drafted into the Army, where he served from 1943 to 1946.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBerkeley: The University of California, Berkeley has received a $252 million donation – its largest-ever single gift – to start construction of a new building for students and faculty studying computing and data science. The gift, made anonymously, will allow the university to start building the Data Hub on the north side of campus, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Another $300 million in donations will be needed to complete the building, which will house the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, which teaches an increasing number of students across a variety of majors. More than 6,000 of the university’s 31,000 undergraduate students take data science classes each year. The Data Hub will house classrooms and offices and also may include robotics and artificial intelligence laboratories, research centers, public gathering areas and a large auditorium.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: An armed man who tried to steal cars from multiple people, including an off-duty sheriff’s deputy, died after an officer-involved shooting Sunday night, police said. The deputy fired at the 35-year-old suspect when he tried to carjack the deputy’s vehicle, police said. An officer who arrived during that attempted carjacking also fired at the suspect, police said. The man died at the scene. The deputy and the officer were not injured. The suspect allegedly first stole a 2004 Dodge truck after hitting the victim with a handgun. After officers found the truck and were investigating that theft, the suspect allegedly got away in a black Cadillac Escalade, but it was disabled after a short chase, police said. The suspect then tried to steal two more vehicles, including the one driven by the off-duty Pueblo County sheriff’s deputy. The man was carrying an AR-15-style rifle, police said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMeriden: Connecticut State Police are hoping to draw more women to their ranks with a special recruiting forum planned during the agency’s latest trooper application process. The forum is scheduled for Sunday and Monday at the Connecticut Police Academy in Meriden. Those interested in attending are urged to RSVP online. Female troopers will be on hand to share their experiences and answer questions. Public safety Commissioner James Rovella and top state police leaders will also talk to prospective applicants. According to state police statistics, women comprise only about 8% of the 922 state trooper positions, and officials say they want to significantly increase that percentage. The deadline to apply to be a state trooper in the current application period is March 13.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: After seeing a significant increase in car crash deaths last year, the state is on track to have even more roadway fatalities in 2020, according to the Delaware Department of Transportation. And that’s worrying state officials. Department of Transportation Secretary Jennifer Cohan told lawmakers Monday that the state’s current highway safety plan is “going in the wrong direction.” “More needs to be done,” she said, without offering specifics. “We need to do better.” As of Tuesday morning, Delaware has had 18 total traffic deaths versus 10 at this time last year, DelDOT said. Ten of the 2020 traffic deaths were vehicle occupants, and eight were pedestrians, according to the data. This time in 2019, Delaware had seen five vehicle occupant deaths and five pedestrian deaths.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Park Service says D.C.’s favorite trees have officially reached the first stage of the blooming process, WUSA-TV reports. The Yoshino cherry blossom trees around the Tidal Basin reached green bud, the first of six stages culminating in peak bloom, on Feb. 28, six days earlier than in 2019. However, that timing remains several days later than the green bud stage was reached in 2018 or 2017. Meteorologists say a mild winter could lead to an earlier peak bloom period, possibly before the Cherry Blossom Festival even begins March 20. The district’s 3,200 Yoshino cherry trees were a gift from Japan more than a century ago to commemorate the friendship and relationship between the two countries. Cherry blossoms are Japan’s national flower, symbolizing hope and peace.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State lawmakers have advanced dueling proposals to require employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States, a key policy priority being pushed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who wants all employers in his state to use a federal database known as E-Verify. Republican lawmakers last year joined DeSantis, in his freshman year as governor, in advancing a ban against so-called sanctuary cities to prevent local governments from giving safe harbor to people who are in the country illegally. But the Legislature declined then to approve an E-Verify bill, partly because key lawmakers – including some top Republicans – expressed concern that the proposal would be a burden to business. Critics of E-Verify say the system remains riddled with outdated and inaccurate data.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge has declined to order election officials in Sumter County to use hand-marked paper ballots after election integrity activists raised concerns that the state’s new voting machines violate voters’ right to a secret ballot. In a lawsuit filed last week in Sumter County Superior Court against the five members of the county election board, the activists said the machines’ large, bright, vertical touchscreens and large font allow other people in the room to see a voter’s selections. In denying an emergency motion seeking a switch to hand-marked paper ballots, Sumter County Superior Court Judge Rucker Smith wrote in an order signed Monday that the activists hadn’t proven that it will be “impossible or impracticable” for the election officials to arrange the voting machines “in a manner that protects the secrecy of the ballot while allowing sufficient monitoring.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A proposal to create a new state agency to build and renovate public schools is moving forward despite concerns the agency would be exempt from many legal safeguards. The School Facilities Agency would be responsible for development, planning and construction of capital improvement projects at public schools, taking over that work from the Department of Education, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency would be exempt from all county ordinances – except building codes – and from state laws focusing on historic preservation, environmental protection, budgeting and civil service. The facilities agency would also be exempt from parts of the procurement code and the Sunshine Law, which governs how state and county board conduct official business. Proponents see the agency as a way to expedite building modern schools and redeveloping old properties without bureaucratic delay.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Several news and legal organizations have told the Idaho Supreme Court that they believe state prison officials are required to reveal the source of drugs used in executions under public records law. The American Bar Association, the Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Idaho Press Club and others filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of a lawsuit that University of Idaho professor Aliza Cover brought against the Idaho Department of Correction. Several news organizations, including the Associated Press, the Idaho Statesman and Boise television station KTVB, joined with the Idaho Press Club in its brief. The Department of Correction didn’t have any comment on the filings, spokesman Jeff Ray said. Cover, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, sued after prison officials largely denied her request for execution-related records in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A new bill would require schools that want to keep using Native American mascots and logos to receive approval from local tribes if they want to participate in playoffs, among other requirements. State Rep. Maurice West, a Rockford Democrat, pitched the plan to the Interscholastic Athletic Organization Act after students at Hononegah High School in Rockton led a protest over the use of the Princess Hononegah Indian mascot and other Native American imagery and iconography. West’s bill would prohibit Hononegah and other schools from using their Indian mascots and logos unless they complied with certain rules, according to the Rockford Register Star. Failure to meet them would make the school ineligible to participate in playoff competitions. Some of the requirements include getting written approval from a tribe based within 500 miles and offering Native American culture programs and courses at the school.\n\nIndiana\n\nLebanon: The slopes of a former municipal landfill could become a park laced with trails for mountain bikes. City engineer Kevin Krulik pitched conceptual designs for the project to Lebanon City Council members last week, telling them the proposed $500,000 mountain bike park would be geared toward families. “This is not a Red Bull racing facility. This is not an extreme mountain bike facility. This is very much family-focused, family-friendly,” Krulik said. The park would be built on a former 110-acre landfill along U.S. 52 in the Boone County city about 20 miles northwest of Indianapolis. That city-owned site operated as Lebanon’s landfill until 1984, when it was shuttered and capped. Lebanon is considering developing the park under a partnership with the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, the Indianapolis Business Journal reports.\n\nIowa\n\nSpringville: A deteriorating Revolutionary War monument will be restored this summer in eastern Iowa if the Daughters of the American Revolution can raise enough money, organizers say. The 16.5-foot marble and granite monument honors a Revolutionary War soldier buried in Linn County. It’s being held together with wire, and the concrete base is falling apart. The monument was damaged by a tornado in 1977. The monument was built in honor of Nathan Brown, a former soldier who settled in Springville in the 1800s. It was commissioned by his son in 1886. Three local Daughters of the American Revolution chapters and the Springville Historical Society have worked for six years to raise money, secure grants and find someone to do the restoration work on the monument. The estimated repair cost: $44,000.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The number of women in prison in the state is growing far faster than the number of men, outpacing national trends, according to a new report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Kansas News Service reports that from 2000 to 2019, the women’s prison population in Kansas rose by 60%, while the men’s rose by 14%. It’s not clear why Kansas’ female prison population grew more than other states’ populations, but policy changes intended to reduce the number of people in prison likely have had different effects on men and women. Last year, 77% of women who entered Kansas prisons did so because they violated probation or parole, compared to 65% of men. According to a senior research analyst at the Kansas Sentencing Commission, the number of female prisoners grew after a 2013 state law that changed probation. Across the country, the population of women in state prisons rose by 26% from 2000 to 2016, while the men’s population rose by 8%.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Knox: It’s going to get loud at Fort Knox. The U.S. Army says to expect more noise than normal at the central Kentucky post over the next couple of weeks as it hosts a training session March 3-16. The training will involve larger caliber weapons than usual, military aircraft and land vehicles, news outlets report, citing a post on the Fort Knox Facebook page. Fort Knox said it was posting the alert as a courtesy to residents in surrounding communities who should expect to hear increased noise and vibrations. “Military training involving aircraft, maneuvers and weapons firing in the daytime and nighttime hours is an important aspect of maintaining critical capabilities and readiness of all units,” the post said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The voter registration deadline is nearing for the state’s presidential primary, and officials are reminding voters that the election is a rare closed primary that allows only registered Democrats and Republicans to cast ballots. Nearly all of Louisiana’s elections are open primaries, where all candidates regardless of party run against each other on the ballot – and all voters can choose among all the candidates. But the April 4 presidential primary is closed. Only Republicans can vote in the GOP primary to select the Republican nominee for president, and only Democrats can choose among the Democratic candidates for president. Those who aren’t registered with either political party cannot vote in the presidential primary. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office said the deadline to register in person or by mail to vote in the election is Wednesday. The deadline for online registration is March 14.\n\nMaine\n\nFort Kent: A Canadian musher crossed the finish line 35 seconds ahead of his closest competitor Monday to win the Can-Am Crown, a 250-mile dog sled race across the wilderness of northern Maine. Denis Tremblay, of Saint Michel des Saints, Quebec, was the Can-Am Crown runner-up four times before notching his dramatic victory. Second-place finisher Katherine Langlais, of Glenwood, New Brunswick, was 12 minutes behind at the start of the final 43-mile sprint, but she closed the gap to 35 seconds for the closest finish in race history, said Can-Am President Dennis Cyr. Neither Tremblay nor Langlais knew how close they were because the hilly course prevented them from seeing each other. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent. The grueling course took mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate has voted to ban a pesticide that has been found to damage children’s brain development. The Senate voted 31-14 on Tuesday for the measure, which now goes to the House. The Senate measure bans the pesticide called chlorpyrifos for four years, beginning Dec. 31. Supporters of a complete ban hope to make it permanent this legislative session. Supporters of the measure say the pesticide also poses threats to aquatic life and the Chesapeake Bay. The Maryland Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would develop regulations to phase out the regular use of the pesticide, but supporters of the legislation are pushing for a ban in the law. California, Hawaii and New York have approved bans on the pesticide.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston area public transit agency has again taken several new rail cars out of service after identifying a potential problem, the agency announced Tuesday. “The new Orange Line trains have been temporarily taken out of service,” the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said in a tweet. “Inspectors identified a fault with the bolsters which is being corrected to ensure the vehicles are reliable & safe for the duration of their service lives.” The trains are expected to return to service later in the week. This is the third time the new train cars have been pulled since two sets of six cars made their debut in August. In September, when a door on one car came open while it was in motion, all were taken out of service to replace a part. They were taken out of service in December to address an “uncommon noise” coming from part of the wheel assembly. One of the new cars derailed in November when there were no passengers on board.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A church in the city has been declared a basilica by Pope Francis, a rare honor for a Roman Catholic parish in the U.S., officials announced Sunday. Ste. Anne Church is one of only 86 churches in the United States, including three in Michigan, to carry the title of Minor Basilica, the Archdiocese of Detroit said. Ste. Anne parish, near the Detroit River, began in 1701 and is the second-oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the U.S., with 575 families, the archdiocese said. The current church was built in 1886. “To demonstrate it met criteria for becoming a Minor Basilica, Ste. Anne extensively documented its heightened liturgical activity and its architectural stature. … It contains many artifacts from the so-called stone church, the church building that preceded the present structure,” the archdiocese said. Archbishop Allen Vigneron will celebrate the designation at a Mass on April 26.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A police officer was justified in fatally shooting a man in a north Minneapolis neighborhood last August, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. In a statement released Monday, Freeman said he determined that the deadly use of force by Officer Jason Wolff was reasonable and therefore not criminal. Police responded to a call about 3 a.m. Aug. 2 and found 32-year-old Mario Benjamin kneeling next to an injured woman in the street. In his interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension conducted two days after the shooting, Wolff said at first he thought Benjamin was trying to help the woman. Then, Wolff saw Benjamin stand up with a gun in his right hand, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Wolff’s body camera footage shows Benjamin holding the gun to his head while Wolff repeatedly orders him to drop the gun. Wolff said he shot Benjamin three or four times after he refused to drop the weapon.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Republican-led Legislature is trying to restrict the reasons women may seek abortion, after federal courts blocked time limitations that the state tried to put on the procedure the past two years. Abortion would be prohibited if a woman is seeking the procedure because of the race, sex or genetic abnormality of the fetus, under a bill that passed a state House committee Tuesday. The only exception would be in case of a medical emergency. Other states have been sued over similar laws, and opponents questioned whether Mississippi is inviting another lawsuit over abortion. House Bill 1295 moves to the full House for more debate. Anyone who performs an abortion because of race, sex or genetic abnormality could face one year to 10 years in prison. The woman having the abortion would not face penalties.\n\nMissouri\n\nSikeston: Strong winds from a thunderstorm are being blamed for the deaths of more than 1,000 birds, all of them found in this southeast Missouri town. The storm rolled through Sikeston on Sunday night. KFVS-TV reports Scott County Conservation Agent Andrew Mothershead and a conservation department biologist were called to the western part of Sikeston after a large number of dead birds were seen near the power plant. Mothershead said in a statement that they found carcasses of red-winged blackbirds, brown-headed cowbirds, grackles and European starlings in fields. They also found several other birds showing signs of injury.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Schools must test drinking water for lead content following state rule changes related to school health, officials said. Schools may begin this month, with a December 2021 deadline to complete testing, The Daily Inter Lake reports. Schools are required to test all fixtures providing water for human consumption or food preparation, including sinks, drinking fountains and water bottle refill stations. State officials encouraged elementary schools to begin testing first because young, developing children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure. Schools are required to test once every three years or submit requests for alternative schedules.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Goodwill Omaha fired its longtime CEO in 2017 amid a scandal over his six-figure salary, $100,000 annual performance bonuses, a $519,000 lump-sum retirement payout and a country club membership. But after it parted ways with Frank McGree, he was paid an additional $610,000, according to Goodwill’s latest public disclosure statement, the Omaha World-Herald reports. He’d sued Goodwill in September 2017 because its board had refused to pay his negotiated severance. In 2018 the charity’s board acknowledged that it settled the lawsuit. Until now, the settlement figure wasn’t publicly known. Goodwill trains and employ people with disabilities and others who may have a hard time getting and keeping jobs. McGree received total compensation of more than $933,000 in 2014, and 13 Goodwill executives were paid more than $100,000, reducing the amount of money available for job training programs.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state’s largest utility has filed a request for more than $30 million in rate reductions for ratepayers beginning in October. Under the request filed with the state Public Utilities Commission, ratepayers in northern Nevada would enjoy about a $24.1 million savings and those in southern Nevada about $6.7 million effective Oct. 1. Utility President and CEO Doug Cannon says the proposed rate cuts are in addition to earlier rate reductions effective April 1 that will reduce the cost of monthly electric bills about $2.10 for northern Nevada customers using 760 kilowatt hours of power. Southern Nevada residential electric customers using 1,092 kilowatt hours of electricity a month will see a decrease of $3.88 on their monthly bills. That reduction is tied to the lower cost of fuel used to produce power at NV Energy’s generating stations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLisbon: A 19th-century farm will be conserved forever by the Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust. The trust has closed on the conservation easement of 30 acres donated by Dori Hamilton, the Caledonian Record reports. The farmhouse, dubbed Tranquil Vewe Croft, was built in 1885 and started by an Irish farmer, Hamilton said. The trust is working with retiring farmers to determine what will happen to similar properties, ACT Executive Director Rebecca Brown said. Brown said food security and potential disruptions to the supply chain are among the concerns being addressed in farmland conservation. “Can we grow all of our food locally?” Brown said. “No, that’s not realistic. But we have to do better than what we are doing now.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nShamong: An emergency medical services crew will fight a $108,000 fine proposed by state officials for sending an unlicensed ambulance to 90 emergencies. Shamong Medical Services, part of the Indian Mills Volunteer Fire Company, operates two vehicles that are licensed through the state’s health department. An audit prompted by an anonymous complaint found that a third unlicensed ambulance had responded to calls between Oct. 7, 2018, and Oct. 9, 2019, according to a notice from the state. The state’s Office of Emergency Medical Services also found that Shamong didn’t staff its ambulances with at least two EMTs as required by state law on 36 occasions, according to the notice. Shamong EMS Chief Dave Taylor told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday that there was “a verbal understanding with the state” that the EMS could operate one unlicensed ambulance with one EMT as long as it did not bill health insurance companies.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Low-income students who qualified for reduced-price school breakfast and lunch no longer have to come up with co-payments for the meals under a measure signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. In signing the bill Monday, the governor said that while many families meet the criteria for reduced fees, they still have difficulty coming up with the money when they have multiple children in school. “A 40-cent copay should never come between a child and the food they need to grow and learn,” she said in a statement. The legislation comes with a $650,000 appropriation that the state Public Education Department will use to reimburse school districts for the fees the children normally would have paid. Supporters say the change will make school meals accessible to an additional 12,500 students.\n\nNew York\n\nNew Rochelle: After months of legal turmoil, the rebirth of the city’s long-vacant armory may be at hand. The city and a developer began renovations to the building last summer, with the intent of enticing another company to develop a project there. But a group of veterans, skeptical of the project, sued New Rochelle and the developer in charge of renovations, Twining, accusing the city of neglecting the armory and even planning to tear it down. If the lawsuit is successful, the city would be stopped from transferring the property to Twining. The city and Twining want the lawsuit thrown out, claiming that renovations have begun, including a new roof. A court date is set for Wednesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDuck: A surfer has won a legal battle to gain access to an 8-foot-wide path that cuts through private property to the ocean on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The Virginian-Pilot reports the legal battle was waged by Bob Hovey and his wife, Tanya, in the town of Duck. The couple had sued the Sand Dollar Shores Homeowners Association for the right to use the path where they go surfing. The walkway passes between two oceanfront houses. A sign said the path was private and only for homeowners and their guests. A judge in Camden Superior Court recently ruled in Hovey’s favor. The ruling could open up other access points at the end of streets near the ocean. Hovey, 50, said on Facebook: “It’s been a long struggle, but the public can now enjoy the beach in Duck.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Community leaders in the state’s oil patch areas are ramping up efforts to encourage census involvement, noting that population totals have a decadelong impact on federal funding. County officials are hoping the next census, which begins this month, accurately reflects their population size, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Since the shale oil boom in places like Williston and Watford City, the population increase has not matched their official census counts. Williams County, which includes Williston, had 22,398 people for the 2010 census. Lindsey Harriman, co-chair of the Williams County Complete Count Committee, suspects the number was lower than the county’s actual population at the time, when the oil boom started. Officials estimate Williams County has more than 47,000 residents today, Harriman said. Under counting is also a concern in McKenzie County.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A Ku Klux Klan group that caused tensions with a rally last year has applied to hold another one this year. The Honorable Sacred Knights of Indiana recently asked for a permit for a Sept. 5 rally in Dayton. Montgomery County’s administrator said the application hasn’t yet been approved, the Dayton Daily News reports. At least 10 people want to speak publicly while defending “white Christian American rights,” the application states. Fewer than 10 people rallied last May on Dayton’s courthouse square, badly outnumbered by hundreds of anti-Klan protesters. A massive police presence kept order without direct clashes or injuries after many downtown businesses shut down and roads were blocked. Mayor Nan Whaley said she’s incredibly frustrated and understands people in Dayton are upset and angry about the group’s plans to return. “Let me be clear: I’m angry too,” she said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStringtown: A prison was on lockdown with no visitation following what prison officials called a “disturbance” among about a half-dozen inmates, the state Department of Corrections said Tuesday. There were no serious injuries as a result of the disturbance Monday night at Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown, about 105 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, said DOC spokesman Matt Elliott. Elliott said the cause of the disturbance was under investigation, and the lockdown was ordered after investigators learned of more potential violence at other state prisons. “We’re trying to head off anything serious” at other facilities, Elliott said. All state prisons were locked down in September after an outbreak of apparent gang-related violence left one inmate dead and more than a dozen injured.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Leaders of an American Indian reservation shut down its casino and several other facilities Monday after an employee contracted coronavirus, and a state health official said the virus is likely circulating and will appear in additional locations in the state. The employee of the Wildhorse Resort and Casino on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation is hospitalized and is the third such case to emerge in Oregon, state and tribal officials said. The previous two other known cases occurred in the Portland area and had household contacts with each other, but the casino is 215 miles east of the city. Meanwhile, dozens of employees of a hospital in a Portland suburb – Kaiser Permanente Westside Medical Center – have been quarantined at home after they may have had contact, unprotected, with the first Oregonian to come down with the virus, The Oregonian reports.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state-owned university system will implement a plan to reduce the size of its faculties by creating an early retirement incentive program. At least 200 members of the faculty at the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education have indicated they will opt for the one-time incentive program, the system said in a statement Monday. The system’s governing board approved the plan in January to align staffing with the decrease in student enrollment. The incentive increases the maximum number of unused sick days for which retirees can be paid out. At least 200 full-time faculty members had to sign up in order to make the plan cost-effective. Faculty members who opted into the program will receive an additional payout of sick leave if they retire on or before Aug. 14, according to the statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is enacting tougher environmental regulations in an effort to contain the spread of invasive species. The state Department of Environmental Management introduced changes that prohibit the transport of any plants and $100 fine for each violation, The Westerly Sun reports. The state has more than 100 ponds and lakes and 27 river segments that are hosting at least one invasive plant species. The species disrupt the habitats of native plants and animals, degrade water quality and hurt recreation. The state’s initiative plans to align Rhode Island with other states in New England, says Katie DeGoosh-DiMarzio, an environmental analyst with state agency’s Office of Water Resources. The new regulations require that freshwater fishermen remove all plants, animals and mud from gear and equipment, as well as drain all water-containing devices. They must also dry equipment for 24 hours before using it again.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state once had one of the county’s highest rates of execution, even putting two prisoners to death in one night. But now it hasn’t executed a prisoner in nine years and lacks the drugs to carry out lethal injections for any of the 37 inmates on the state’s death row. Some lawmakers are pushing to give the state an option to start executing prisoners again by giving them no choice but to go to the electric chair. Currently, condemned South Carolina prisoners have a choice between lethal injection or electrocution, with lethal injection as the default if they do not pick. The bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday forces inmates to be electrocuted if lethal injection is not available, like the current situation in which South Carolina’s supply of lethal injection drugs has expired and no pharmaceutical companies will sell them any more without a guarantee they won’t be publicly identified. The proposal now heads to the House floor.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers and Gov. Kristi Noem floated vastly different cost estimates for legalizing industrial hemp Tuesday, presenting a final hang-up to the resolution of their yearlong dispute. The governor’s office argued that the legalization of industrial hemp would fundamentally change how the state enforces its marijuana laws and require an expansion of staff, drug testing and law enforcement across three state agencies. Lawmakers cast it as an agricultural program similar to other crops that would require oversight by just one person and part-time testing by law enforcement. Rep. Oren Lesmeister, a Democrat from Parade and a proponent of hemp, said the governor’s office inflated the numbers based on a false presumption that drug cases would “skyrocket” as a result of an industrial hemp program. He charged that the governor is using the high estimates as a tactic to thwart the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Eleven Nashville and Memphis parents are suing the state for its controversial Education Savings Account program, marking the second lawsuit filed contending the program is unconstitutional. The suit was filed Monday on behalf of the 11 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Education Law Center and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP. The petition, filed in Davidson County court, says the state’s program violates numerous provisions in Tennessee’s constitution. The lawsuit outlines similar complaints made in a February lawsuit by Nashville, Shelby County and Metro Nashville Public Schools. Education savings accounts, a voucher-style program, use taxpayer funds deposited for families who withdraw their children from public school. The program is limited to Memphis and Nashville and was a campaign promise of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Leaning Tower of Dallas, the nearly iconic remnant of a high-rise building implosion gone awry, finally collapsed in a cloud of dust Monday after two weeks of being whacked with a headache ball. The tower collapsed about 3:15 p.m. after a few last whacks with a wrecking ball swung by a high-rise crane. No injuries were reported. The tower was the core of an 11-story building that was imploded with explosives Feb. 16. The 11 floors surrounding the core duly collapsed, but the solid concrete core containing the stairway and elevator shafts remained standing at an angle. The demolition contractor has been whacking away at it ever since with a 5,600-pound wrecking ball. In the meantime, the tower drew hundreds of people who took often-whimsical photographs of themselves with the tower in the background.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A bill targeting a new Salt Lake County rule to require gun show vendors in county facilities to run background checks on customers passed the state House of Representatives. The bill passed without debate Friday aims to clarify state control over gun laws in Utah, The Deseret News reports. The bill would prevent cities or counties from being able to work around the state’s gun legislation. The bill passed after lawmakers approved an amendment clarifying guns can be banned in homeless shelters, as well as striking a clause allowing elected officials to be sued for voting to regulate firearms. The bill is sponsored by Republican Rep. Cory Maloy, an outspoken Second Amendment supporter, and faces opposition from Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson and Democrats who argue local governments should be able to pass regulations. The bill will proceed to the state Senate for consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city has a new public official whose job is part of Burlington’s long-running effort to advance equity. The hiring of Tyeastia Green, whose formal title is director of racial equity, inclusion and belonging, was announced last week by Mayor Miro Weinberger. “Breaking down the barriers of institutional racism and implicit bias requires hard, detailed and sustained organizational work,” Weinberger said. Green brings to Vermont her experience working with municipal employees on race and equity issues in Bloomington, Minnesota. There, she worked with a team to create the city’s first Racial Equity Toolkit, a policy document to inform decisions the city makes through the lens of racial equity. She also developed the Start Seeing Color campaign to bring visibility to race. Green said she is excited for her new position in Burlington because of its focus on inclusion.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A solar array at an elementary school is the first to receive the highest possible designation under a new program that encourages pollinator-friendly solar development. The Department of Conservation and Recreation announced Monday that Cople Elementary School in Westmoreland County had been awarded a Gold Certified Pollinator Smart Project label. The program includes recommendations to plan, build and monitor solar facilities that attract pollinators, lessen stormwater impacts and increase the visual appeal of the installations, according to the department. A key focus is the use of Virginia native plant species. Charlottesville-based Sun Tribe installed the project. The company said in a news release that the ground-mounted solar system meets 100% of the school’s energy needs and will save Westmoreland County Public Schools an estimated $3.6 million in energy costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The City Council has adopted a new law that seeks in part to dampen the loud protests outside the Planned Parenthood Spokane Health Center. The Spokesman-Review reports the ordinance passed 6-1 on Monday night, with Councilman Michael Cathcart casting the only “no” vote. Council members who supported the measure stressed it was not intended to restrict anti-abortion protesters’ rights to march, hold signs and pray. “All we’re asking is that you keep the noise down to a reasonable level,” Councilwoman Karen Stratton said. The ordinance was proposed in part because a group called the Church at Planned Parenthood has regular gatherings of anti-abortion activists who sing and pray outside the clinic’s walls. Planned Parenthood has said the demonstrations can be heard through its walls and interfere with the services it provides to patients, which include abortion but also STD and cancer screening, pregnancy testing and birth control.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It could soon be easier for power companies to use solar energy under a bill passed Tuesday in the House of Delegates. Lawmakers voted 75-23 to approve the measure after about an hour of debate that revolved around whether it’s better to focus on coal or renewable energy sources. The state commerce department pushed for the bill, saying big companies want to know that they can use renewable energy sources before relocating to a state. The proposal would create a regulatory program for utilities to use a small amount of renewables. The measure makes several nods to the coal business and says nothing in the bill can “displace any current levels of coal-fired generation capacity.” The bill now moves to the Senate for the chamber to approve some minor House amendments. Senators unanimously approved the measure last month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOak Creek: A survivor of a shooting at a suburban Milwaukee Sikh temple that killed six worshippers in 2012 has died of complications stemming from a bullet wound to his head. Baba Punjab Singh’s death Monday ties the temple shooting with a 2005 church shooting as the deadliest mass shootings in Wisconsin in the past 20 years. White supremacist Wade Michael Page burst into the temple in Oak Creek on Aug. 5, 2012, and shot 10 people, killing six and wounding four. He ultimately killed himself during a firefight with an arriving police officer in the temple parking lot. “I think, collectively as a community, (Singh’s death) reopens a lot of wounds that might have scabbed over,” said Pardeep Kaleka, whose father, temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, was killed in the shooting. “But we express condolences to his family and just hope that they over the next couple weeks can have some closure.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state had the second-highest suicide rate in the United States in 2018, a new report says. An American Association of Suicidology study released earlier this month found 25.4 out of every 100,000 Wyoming residents took their own lives in 2018, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The figure fell from 2017, when Wyoming had more than 27 people per 100,000 people who died by suicide. The 2018 national suicide rate was 14.8 per 100,000 people. New Mexico had the highest rate with 25.6 that year. Wyoming’s age group with the highest rate of suicide was between 20 and 24 years old. There were 16 cases of suicide in that group in 2018. The association found more than 73% of Wyoming residents who died by suicide used a firearm. The national percentage was 50%. Wyoming has been in the highest five of state suicide rates since 1996.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/18/roadrunner-van-monkeypox-quick-build-shelters-news-around-states/49396769/", "title": "Roadrunner by van, monkeypox: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Convicted former state House Speaker Mike Hubbard told people he was innocent and “held my nose” as he signed a letter apologizing for his crimes, according to state prosecutors who used Hubbard’s own phone calls and emails from prison to cast doubt on his claims of remorse as he seeks early release. The attorney general’s office combed through emails and 600 of Hubbard’s phone calls from prison and cited some of the conversations as they oppose his request for early release from prison. State attorneys said the communications show he was “not truthful” when he signed a letter apologizing for his 2016 conviction for violating state ethics law, including using his public office for personal financial gain. Hubbard submitted the letter – in which he said that “I recognize and admit my errors” – in September along with a request for early release from prison. He wrote that his conviction embarrassed the state and his family and that “for this, I am severely sorry and respectfully ask forgiveness from everyone affected.” According to the Monday court filing, Hubbard told a friend before submitting the apology letter that “I promise you I did nothing wrong.” Prosecutors said Hubbard also talked to friends about efforts to add language to community corrections legislation that could benefit his release.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fast-growing area north of Anchorage known as a hotbed of conservatism gained the most population since the 2010 census and will keep the same number of seats in the Legislature under a new map of state political boundaries that some critics say shortchanges the area. It’s not the only criticism of the plan approved by a divided state Redistricting Board, and court challenges are expected. Among the criticisms are House district pairings for Senate seats for the Anchorage and Eagle River areas that board member Nicole Borromeo said would open the board to “an unfortunate and very easily winnable argument of partisan gerrymandering.” Census data showed the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which is about the size of West Virginia and includes Palmer and former Gov. Sarah Palin’s hometown of Wasilla north of Anchorage, had 18,086 more people last year than in 2010, the biggest jump for any borough or census area in Alaska. The region also was the second most populous overall in the state, with an estimated 107,081 people, behind Anchorage, with 291,247, according to census data. While the region would have the same number of seats, new House maps would place two Wasilla incumbents in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s corrections chief says incarcerated people often have greater access to health services than people who aren’t locked up. Corrections Director David Shinn’s defense of the health care system for inmates came as he testified at a trial about the quality of medical and mental health care in state prisons, after the state has faced years of complaints and been fined $2.5 million for not complying with a settlement over the issue. A judge who threw the settlement out this summer concluded that the state showed little interest in making many improvements it promised under the 6-year-old deal and that inadequate care for prisoners had led to suffering and preventable deaths. “They often have greater access to care than I do as a private citizen,” Shinn said of people behind bars. Lawyers for the inmates are asking U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver to take over health care operations in state-run prisons, appoint an official to run medical and mental health services there, ensure prisons have enough health care workers, and reduce the use of isolation cells, including banning their use for prisoners under age 18 or those with serious mental illnesses. They say Arizona’s prison health care operations are understaffed and poorly supervised, routinely deny access to necessary medications, fail to provide adequate pain management for end-stage cancer patients and others, and don’t meet the minimum standards for mental health care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLonoke: A former sheriff’s deputy pleaded not guilty Monday in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of civil rights activists. Michael Davis entered the plea to a felony count of manslaughter in the June 23 shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Davis shot Brittain during a traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis was charged in September in Brittain’s death. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to Davis’ arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands, according to the affidavit. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Staples Center is getting a new name. Starting Christmas Day, it will be Crypto.com Arena. The downtown Los Angeles home of the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers, the NHL’s Kings and the WNBA’s Sparks will change its name after 22 years of operation, arena owner AEG announced Tuesday night. A person with knowledge of the deal said Crypto.com is paying $700 million over 20 years to rename the building. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the parties aren’t publicly announcing the terms of what’s believed to be the richest naming rights deal in sports history. The 20,000-seat arena has been the Staples Center since it opened in October 1999, with the naming rights owned by the American office-supplies retail company under a 20-year agreement. The name will change when the Lakers host the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA’s annual Christmas showcase. Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency platform and exchange headquartered in Singapore. Along with its sports tenants, the arena has hosted 19 Grammy Awards ceremonies, three NBA All-Star Games, two NHL All-Star Games, and countless high-profile concerts, performances and important public events, including memorials for Michael Jackson, Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant. The Lakers have won six NBA championships during their tenure in the cavernous arena.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A suburban Denver police department has agreed to reforms after the killing of Elijah McClain led to indictments against officers and a first-of-its-kind civil rights investigation that found a pattern of racially biased policing and excessive force. The plan, announced Tuesday by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Aurora’s city manager, police chief and fire chief, was reached in response to a civil rights investigation launched by Weiser amid outrage over the death of McClain, a Black man who was put into a chokehold by police and injected with ketamine by paramedics in 2019. The proposal calls for the city to revamp its use-of-force policies and launch new training programs in an effort to combat bias in the ranks. Another key goal of the agreement is eliminating unnecessary use of force and increasing tracking and transparency about how officers engage with the community, Weiser said. It also aims to create a more diverse workforce in the police and fire departments. Aurora city officials said they are on board with the plan, which also includes the city’s fire department. It still hinges on City Council approval. “We are not going to shy away from reform,” Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said. “To the officers on the street, this consent decree is nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Seven women who say they suffered excruciating pain after a nurse stole fentanyl for her personal use and replaced it with saline sued Yale University on Wednesday, alleging it failed to safeguard its supply of the painkilling opioid at a fertility clinic. The women say they underwent painful and invasive procedures for in vitro fertilization and were supposed to receive fentanyl at the Yale University Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic in Orange, Connecticut, last year. Unbeknownst to them, they received saline instead of fentanyl, and when they told staff of their extreme pain during and after the procedures, their concerns were dismissed, according to the lawsuit filed in state court in Waterbury by the women and their spouses. “Yale’s failure to develop and implement safety measures mandated by state and federal law to secure drugs like fentanyl resulted in these patients being traumatized,” Joshua Koskoff, a lawyer for the women, said in a statement. “What should have been a time of hope for these women and their families became one of unimaginable suffering.” Yale spokesperson Karen Peart Peart said university officials will not comment on the lawsuit, which seeks undisclosed damages.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A fledgling nonprofit’s efforts to address homelessness with temporary shelter villages are progressing in Sussex County and could become a statewide solution. “Our vision is to build across state,” said Judson Malone, Springboard Collaborative co-founder and director. “We think we have a provable model that actually has a solution to homelessness.” The Georgetown Town Council passed a resolution Oct. 27 allowing Springboard to build and manage a temporary shelter village, similar to a tiny home village. Conley’s Church, in the Angola area of Lewes, has offered its property for a second such site. Springboard will use shelters designed by an Everett, Washington, company called Pallet, named for how the shelters are shipped. They’re framed with aluminum, and the panels are made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic with a foam-insulating core, according to the company’s website. Like traditional houses, Pallet shelters are temperature-controlled, weather-resistant and lockable, but they can be assembled in less than an hour and cost as low as $5,500. They’re not quite tiny houses, though. Pallet shelters do not have plumbing, kitchens or bathrooms, as they’re meant to be temporary shelters. In typical Pallet villages, there are shared bathhouses, laundry facilities and eating areas.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After 34 days of protest at the Blackburn University Center, Howard University students have reached an agreement with the school, ending their weeks­long sit-in demonstration, WUSA-TV reports. “Howard University is pleased to announce that we have come to an agreement with the students who occupied Blackburn,” university President Wayne Frederick wrote in a statement released on Twitter and Youtube. “The health and well-being of our students is the most important part of my job as president. As I have said before, even one issue in one of our dormitories is too many, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our pledge to maintain safe and high-end housing.” Frederick’s statement also referenced the 2020 campus master plan, promising to “grow and invest in our beloved Hilltop” and to share more details soon of his plans to bring the campus back together following this division. Dozens of Howard University students had occupied the Blackburn University Center for weeks, setting up and living out of tents to bring attention to several issues, including living conditions in their dorm rooms, as they claim some were found to have mold. They also wanted student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 1,000 manatees have died in the state so far this year, eclipsing a previous annual record as the threatened marine mammals struggle with starvation due to pollution in the water. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported the updated total Wednesday. The 1,003 manatee deaths so far in 2021 are many more than the 637 recorded last year and well above the previous mark of 830 set in 2013. Slow-moving, bulky manatees have long struggled to coexist with humans. Boat strikes account for some deaths and many injuries. But state officials and environmental groups say polluted water runoff from agriculture, sewage and other man-made development has caused algae blooms in estuaries, choking off the seagrass upon which manatees rely. Climate change is worsening the problem. Authorities expected another bad year for manatees, with more deaths to come as Florida enters the winter months, when the animals congregate in warm-water areas where food supplies have dwindled. Seagrass beds on the state’s eastern coast have been hit especially hard. To compound the problem, manatees are slow to reproduce. According to the nonprofit Save the Manatee Club – co-founded by Florida troubadour Jimmy Buffet – one calf is born every two to five years after a manatee reaches sexual maturity at about age 5. Twin births are rare.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Scores of housing activists, tenants and lawmakers rallied Tuesday to pressure officials to speed up the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid aimed at preventing evictions in the state. Congress set aside nearly $1 billion in funding for Georgia to help tenants pay past-due rent and utility bills during the pandemic, but the state has struggled to get the money out. Georgia had distributed less than 10% of the first set of funds by the end of September, according to a report last week by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The report singled out Georgia, Ohio, Arizona and Tennessee for their slow disbursement of aid and large populations of renters. At Tuesday’s rally in downtown Atlanta, Lajoycelyn Bowles, 43, said she has repeatedly contacted the Georgia Department of Community Affairs – the state agency administering Georgia’s funds – but has never heard back. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in August and has been too sick to work. She received an eviction notice this week from her landlord in Lithonia. “I’m frustrated and pissed off,” she said. The Department of Community Affairs said in a statement that it has distributed $44.2 million to more than 6,900 tenants and landlords so far. It has also added staff and extended working hours to handle an increase in applications.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state ranks last in the nation for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, according to a new study from the American Lung Association. Just 2.8% of high-risk smokers in Hawaii undergo annual CT scans that capture detailed pictures of the lungs, compared to 5.7% nationally, the study said. A state-by-state analysis also found that just 19% of lung cancer cases in Hawaii are diagnosed early, compared to 24.5% nationally, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that smokers and former smokers who are at high risk of developing lung cancer undergo the CT scans. The high-risk category includes adults between the ages of 55 and 80 who smoke a pack a day or more and former heavy smokers who quit in the past 15 years. The annual screenings are limited to the highest-risk smokers, in part due to the risk of false positive results, which can cause anxiety and lead to follow-up tests and procedures that aren’t needed and carry their own risk. Detecting lung cancer early can dramatically improve the chances of successfully treating it. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed early is 60%. The survival rate drops to 6% when spotted at a late stage. The study found that Native Hawaiians are more likely to be diagnosed and die of lung cancer than other ethnic groups.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill making it easier for residents to get worker compensation if they become ill after taking an employee-mandated vaccine sailed through the state House and headed for the Senate on Tuesday. The measure passed the House on a 67-3 vote. It was among seven COVID-19-related bills the chamber pushed through with expedited voting and sent to the Senate. Supporters said workers are getting sick after being vaccinated against COVID-19, and some are having problems receiving compensation. The bill tilts the field toward employees for compensation of hard-to-prove claims such as illnesses caused by vaccines, backers said. “If the employer is telling you, ‘You have to do this in order to work here,’ if they’re doing that, then, by golly, I think our system ought to provide a fair compensation method,” Democratic Rep. John Gannon said. Bill opponents said THAT Idaho’s worker compensation has worked well for decades and that workers sickened by vaccines are already being compensated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines can include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. Also heading to the Senate was a bill that would prohibit questioning the sincerity of people claiming religious exemptions from vaccinations.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday signed a law making voting easier for people with disabilities and creating a group to study removal of further barriers. The law also makes adjustments in deadlines and other technical requirements for candidates in next year’s primary election because it’s later. Pritzker signed a law in June moving the primary from March 15 to June 28 because late-arriving 2020 census numbers delayed the drawing of new congressional district boundaries. Under the law, which takes effect immediately, any polling place that is accessible to voters with disabilities and elderly voters is to include at least one voting booth that is wheelchair-accessible. The Access to Voting for Persons with Disabilities Advisory Task Force will be composed of 15 members, three each appointed by the governor and leaders of the partisan caucuses in House and Senate. The group must meet at least four times and publish its results. Another change allows voters to designate sex on voter registration forms as “male,” “female” or “non-binary.” The measure was sponsored by Senate President Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, and Democratic Rep. Katie Stuart of Edwardsville.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest teachers union is calling on lawmakers to address educator burnout and ongoing teacher shortages during the next legislative session that begins in January. The state is “slowly making progress” on teacher pay, but additional action is needed to attract and retain teachers, Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill said during a news conference Monday. Teacher workload and burnout were already issues before the start of the pandemic, Gambill said, but the onset of the coronavirus has since worsened the teacher shortage. “We are now going into the third consecutive school year impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. “Our educators, already overburdened, are facing unsustainable levels of stress and stress-related illness.” The shortage of teachers – compounded by a substitute shortage – has meant more educators are required to work longer hours without time off or time for classroom planning, Gambill said. For some, he said that has included working 12-plus-hour days on top of second or third jobs. Gambill said educators cite a lack of professional respect as a contributing factor in the lack of teachers. In response, he said the union is calling on the Legislature to restore teachers’ ability to bargain contracts that include health and safety conditions, class sizes and prep periods.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most Iowans support United Auto Workers members over their Deere & Co. bosses in the 10,100-worker strike in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds. About 58% of Iowa adults say they mostly side with Deere workers, compared to just 16% who mostly side with the employers. Another 19% are unsure, and 7% support neither group. With the strike in its fifth week, the UAW announced Friday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Deere. Union members, who have rejected two previous offers, were voting Wednesday on the latest pact. Striking UAW members have a majority or plurality of Iowans’ support regardless of political party, age, gender, educational attainment, religious affiliation, income bracket, or whether they live in a rural or urban area. Selzer & Co. conducted the poll of 810 adults Nov. 7-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Elsie Carroll, 31, a customer service representative in Dubuque who participated in the poll, said she supports the workers because she believes they would sacrifice their paychecks to go on strike only if the company is failing them. UAW members on strike receive $275 a week from the union, far less than what they earn at Deere.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A high-ranking Republican lawmaker who is running for statewide office wants the upcoming special session to put an end to coronavirus contact tracing, calling the practice an invasion of privacy. State Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, made the suggestion to “stop this specific contact tracing” at a Monday meeting of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules and Regulations. The GOP supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature forced Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to call a special session starting Nov. 22. Lawmakers are set to debate proposals on COVID-19 vaccine mandate exemptions and unemployment insurance for unvaccinated workers who lose their jobs, though additional measures could be proposed. Tyson, who is running for state treasurer, said during and after the meeting that she would want legislation removing virus contact tracing language from last session’s appropriations bill. But she demurred on whether she would introduce a bill or an amendment herself. The budget bill granted the Kansas Department of Health and Environment the authority to hire contact tracers and to adopt related regulations. It is unclear whether repealing the contact tracing provision as Tyson proposed would end the practice or remove some of the more arduous rules imposed by the Legislature.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Appalachian Regional Commission has awarded more than $1.5 million in federal funds to five Kentucky projects that aim to address the region’s substance abuse crisis through recovery-to-work programs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The grants announced Tuesday are part of an ARC initiative that focuses on funding efforts that help create recovery-friendly work environments and provide supports to those in recovery and their employers. The projects can also include job training. Since April 2021, ARC has invested $14.9 million in 47 related projects. A request for proposals for a third round of awards will be be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state board granted parole Wednesday to Henry Montgomery, whose Supreme Court case was instrumental in extending the possibility of freedom to hundreds of people sentenced to life in prison without the opportunity for parole when they were juveniles. Montgomery, 75, was convicted in the 1963 killing of Charles Hurt, an East Baton Rouge sheriff’s deputy who caught him skipping school. Montgomery was 17 at the time. He was initially sentenced to death, but the state’s Supreme Court threw out his conviction in 1966, saying he didn’t get a fair trial. The case was retried and Montgomery convicted again, sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He served decades at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. A three-member board voted unanimously in favor of parole. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting was held on Zoom, with Montgomery appearing on camera from the prison where he has spent his entire adult life. “He’s been in prison for 57 years. He has an excellent … disciplinary record. He is a low risk by our assessment. He’s got good comments from the warden. He has a very good prison record,” board member Tony Marabella said as he voted to approve Montgomery’s release with certain conditions, including a curfew and that he have no contact with the victim’s family.\n\nMaine\n\nFreedom: A wayward roadrunner is on the mend in the Pine Tree State after traveling across the country in a moving van. The greater roadrunner, a species native to Southwestern states, hitched a ride in the storage area of a moving van from Las Vegas to Westbrook, Maine. Volunteers took the bird to Avian Haven, a bird rehabilitation facility. Avian Haven representatives said they took the call about the bird Nov. 13, and it continued to rest Tuesday. They said in a Facebook post that the bird was in “remarkably good shape” for having been stuck in a van for four days but might have lost weight during the journey. The center is looking at ways to return the roadrunner to Nevada once it is healthy enough, said Diane Winn, Avian Haven’s executive director. The center has created a special habitat for the bird that is warmer than its typical outdoor areas while also being sufficiently roomy, the group said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A case of monkeypox has been confirmed in a Maryland resident who recently returned from Nigeria, state health officials announced Tuesday. The person had mild symptoms and is recovering in isolation but isn’t hospitalized, the Department of Health said in a news release. The general public doesn’t need to take any special precautions, officials said. People who may have been in contact with the person who was diagnosed with the illness have been identified, and public health authorities are continuing to follow up with them, Deputy Secretary for Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan said in a statement. Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses as smallpox but generally causes a milder infection, officials said. It can be spread through direct contact with lesions or body fluids or via contaminated materials like clothing or large respiratory droplets. Illness typically begins with flu-like symptoms and lymph node swelling and progresses to a rash on the face and body. The people who may have been exposed in this case will be monitored for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Human monkeypox infections primarily occur in central and western African countries and have only rarely been documented outside of Africa.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michelle Wu was sworn in Tuesday as the first woman and first person of color elected mayor in the city’s long history. The swearing-in of Boston’s first Asian American mayor came two weeks after Wu won the election. Before Wu, Boston had elected only white men as mayor. “City government is special. We are the level closest to the people, so we must do the big and the small. Every streetlight, every pothole, every park and classroom lays the foundation for greater change,” Wu said after taking the oath of office. “After all, Boston was founded on a revolutionary promise: that things don’t have to be as they always have been. That we can chart a new path for families now, and for generations to come, grounded in justice and opportunity,” she said. Wu, 36, takes over for a fellow Democrat – former acting Mayor Kim Janey – who was Boston’s first woman and first Black resident to serve in the top post, to which she was not elected. To push back against soaring housing costs that have forced some former residents out of the city, Wu has promised to pursue rent stabilization or rent control. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is the fact that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide. Another of Wu’s top campaign promises is to create a “fare-free” public transit system.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A federal judge retained jurisdiction Tuesday in a dispute over a Canadian oil pipeline that runs through a section of the Great Lakes, rejecting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s contention that the case belongs in state court. The clash over whether Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 should continue operating raises issues “under consideration at the highest levels of this country’s government” involving a U.S.-Canada treaty and federal pipeline safety regulation, U.S. District Judge Janet Neff ruled. The matter “is properly in federal court,” she wrote in a 15-page opinion that drew praise from Enbridge. Whitmer’s office expressed disappointment, and environmentalists ramped up pressure on President Joe Biden to intervene. Line 5 moves 23 million gallons daily of crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, passing through northern Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A 4-mile section is divided into two pipes that cross the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. Whitmer ordered Enbridge last year to close the 68-year-old line, agreeing with Indigenous tribes, environmentalists and tourist businesses that it risks a devastating spill. Enbridge contends the line is safe and ignored the Democratic governor’s May 12 shutdown deadline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Department of Defense will send medical teams to two major hospitals to relieve doctors and nurses who are swamped by a growing wave of COVID-19 patients, Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday. The teams, each comprising 22 people, will arrive at Hennepin County Medical Center and St. Cloud Hospital next week and begin treating patients immediately, Walz said in a conference call from the Finnish capital, Helsinki. the latest stop on his European trade mission. Minnesota has become one of the country’s worst hot spots for new coronavirus infections. Hospital beds are filling up with unvaccinated people, and staffers are being worn down by the surge. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday that she’s ready to expand access to booster vaccines to all adults by the end of the week if the federal government doesn’t act first. “Our best defense against this is the vaccine,” Walz told reporters. He noted that Minnesota is No. 2 in the county for the number of booster shots given, behind only Vermont, and that first doses have risen 60% over the past week. “And we know that that is our way out of this. … I need Minnesotans to recognize, as we’ve been saying, this is a dangerous time.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Saying it could be days before tap water is safe to drink, officials issued a citywide boil-water order the same day the Environmental Protection Agency was in town to tout the newly passed federal infrastructure bill. About 15,000 residents and businesses, mostly in south and west Jackson, were without water Monday and early Tuesday, city officials said. Water pressure is gradually being restored, and most residents should have at least some water coming out of the tap. “Obviously, this is not a position that we want to be in,” Jackson City Engineer Charles Williams said. The water is not safe to drink anywhere in the city until the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water and declares it contaminant-free. The boil order will probably be lifted gradually as water pressure is restored, Williams said, with Thursday the soonest the order may be lifted in any part of Jackson. Williams said the city received a bad batch of aluminum chlorohydrate, a chemical used to treat drinking water, and workers shut down part of the water treatment system at the O.B. Curtis plant Saturday. None of the chemical made it into the city’s water supply, and residents were not exposed, Williams said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: State Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued the city’s school district Tuesday over its response to his office’s requests for records related to critical race theory and anti-racist teaching. Schmitt’s office submitted a Sunshine Law request in October seeking records from the district relating to how and whether it teaches critical race theory. Schmitt, a Republican running for Senate, alleges in the lawsuit that the district broke the law by demanding payment for services other than copies before it would make public records available to his office. He also contends the district didn’t use hourly rates that would have kept the cost of fulfilling the request as low as possible, as required by law. The district initially required a deposit of $37,000 to process the request before it began searching for records, according to the lawsuit. Schmitt’s lawsuit claims the district has used critical race theory in its teachers’ training for at least two years, citing as an example a training program in 2020 for about 170 teachers and staff that would “create shared understanding … around complex issues of systemic racism and xenophobia” and allow them to “receive tools on how to become anti-racist.” District spokesman Stephen Hall said in a statement that the district focuses on equity but does not teach critical race theory.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Native American tribes in the state – including the Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and Fort Belknap Indian Community, as well as the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council – have expressed support for a bill that would establish a panel to look into the history of U.S. efforts to force assimilation. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the U.S. Act would establish a formal, diverse commission to investigate and document Indian boarding school policies, including the U.S. government’s attempt to terminate Indigenous cultures, religions and languages. The commission should recommend practices for the federal government to acknowledge these atrocities and promote healing. The panel would also hold culturally sensitive public hearings for boarding school survivors and community members. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council in October passed a resolution supporting congressional efforts in approving the act. Lauren Monroe Jr., council secretary, said past atrocities still influence Indigenous people today. “For Blackfeet people that don’t speak the language or don’t know our history, this isn’t so much in the past as it is in the present,” he said. “Until we have this conversation, there can’t be progress or healing.”\n\nNebraska\n\nScottsbluff: A fire that had burned about 2,560 acres in northwest Nebraska was about 40% contained, officials said Tuesday. The fire in the Buffalo Creek Wildlife Management Area in Scotts Bluff and Banner counties began Sunday, and efforts to contain it are expected to last through the week, The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The Buffalo Creek wildlife area is about 7 miles southeast of Gering and Scottsbluff. No homes had been burned, no injuries were reported, and no evacuations had been necessary, according to an update provided Tuesday. The firefighting effort has included helicopters, with 27 departments supplying resources and firefighters, who have been working 16-hour shifts, the Scottsbluff Star Herald reports. The National Weather Service posted a red flag warning for the area, which means any fire that ignites could grow rapidly. The area was reporting temperatures in the 50s and the 60s, 20% humidity and wind speeds of 20-30 mph.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man’s admission that he voted twice in November 2020 in a case on which state Republicans seized to claim voter irregularities amounted to “a cheap political stunt” that backfired, a state court judge said Tuesday. Donald “Kirk” Hartle appeared by videoconference from his defense attorney’s office to plead guilty to a misdemeanor – voting more than once in the same election – and told Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny he accepted full responsibility for his actions and regrets them. Hartle’s attorney, David Chesnoff, prevented his client from having to describe publicly how he voted early using a ballot that had been mailed to his dead wife. Rosemarie Hartle died in 2017, but her name remained on the voter rolls. Chesnoff told the judge that state Attorney General Aaron Ford’s office agreed to reduce two felony charges against Hartle to the misdemeanor. Kierny made it clear she was unhappy with the deal but accepted it. Hartle was fined $2,000 and has to stay out of trouble for one year. The judge set a Nov. 17, 2022, date to review the result. “This seems to me to be a cheap political stunt that kind of backfired,” Kierny said, “and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The city is getting a $25 million federal grant to help improve transportation in the South Millyard area. The grant was announced by the state’s congressional delegation Tuesday. “This project will mitigate traffic congestion, provide increased transportation options including biking and walking trails and a pedestrian bridge over Granite Street and create opportunities for development throughout South Elm Street,” Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said in a statement. “This is a big deal for the City of Manchester.” The grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation will be allocated through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant program. Manchester’s award ties with the state of New Mexico for the largest RAISE grant in the country this year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are proposing financial relief for the city’s casinos to help them continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic by exempting two of the industry’s fastest-growing revenue streams from calculations on how much the casinos should pay the city. It would reduce payments for some casinos, including the Borgata, while imposing higher payments onto others, including Hard Rock. The bill, advanced Monday by a state Senate committee, is a renewal of a measure requiring the casinos to make payments in lieu of taxes to Atlantic City that was first enacted five years ago, when the city was reeling from the closure of five of its 12 casinos. There currently are nine casinos. Easily able back then to show that their businesses were worth less in a declining market, the casinos successfully appealed their property tax assessments year after year, helping to blow huge holes in Atlantic City’s budget. Meanwhile, New Jersey’s red-hot sports betting industry smashed its own national record in October for the highest amount of bets taken in a single month, topping $1.3 billion. That figure easily surpassed the $1.01 billion worth of bets that Atlantic City’s nine casinos and the three horse tracks that offer sports betting took in September.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nEunice: The city is looking to salty underground sources as it seeks an “unlimited” supply of water. The Eunice City Council recently voted to have a Hobbs-based engineering firm continue studying the benefits of building a desalination plant for the community. Amid depletion of fresh water from the Ogallala Aquifer continues, the council wants to know the feasibility of a proposed alternative: desalination of saline or brackish water. The Hobbs News-Sun reports it could cost about $5.5 million to build a plant, and the completion of the engineering study likely will provide a more accurate estimate. City Manager Jordan Yutzy told the councilors that the engineering work by Pettigrew and Associates will cost about $464,000. State funds are paying for the work. The engineering firm began the study last summer to determine whether water from underground brackish aquifers can economically be desalinated for human consumption. The Ogallala Aquifer underlies portions of eight states, in which agriculture, commercial industry and residences use more than is replenished from rainfall or snowmelt. Below the freshwater aquifer are saline and brackish water supplies that need to be treated, often at high cost, before human consumption.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new effort to find a mass-transit solution for LaGuardia Airport after a $2 billion rail link project was put on hold amid criticism from public officials will look at options including ferry service, a subway extension and dedicated bus lanes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, announced Tuesday that it has commissioned a panel to review alternatives for LaGuardia, one of the few major airports in the country without a rail link. The panel will consist of Mike Brown, former London transportation commissioner and managing director of Heathrow Airport; Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner; and Philip Washington, the CEO of Denver International Airport and a former CEO of Los Angeles Metro. Tom Wright, president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, a New York-based think tank, called the formation of the panel “the right move at a critical time for our region.” A 1.5-mile elevated railway linking the airport to a rail station near CitiField in Queens was given environmental approved by federal regulators in July, but the plan prompted criticism from Gov. Kathy Hochul and other officials, as well as a lawsuit from an environmental group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The largest school system in the state said none of its students went hungry Tuesday despite a sickout by school cafeteria workers demanding better pay and improved working conditions. Leaders at the Wake County Public School System warned parents that another sickout could affect food services at other schools Wednesday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Late Monday evening, the Wake County school system alerted families at 32 schools that they should bring their own lunch on Tuesday because the system couldn’t guarantee meal service. But a tweet sent in the morning indicated the district was able to provide meals to every student who wanted one. The district provided bagged lunches to students, according to Lisa Luten, a school spokeswoman. Luten also said parents and local businesses and restaurants also brought in food for students Tuesday. WCPSS warned Tuesday night that 15 schools could be affected by staffing shortages Wednesday. The sickout comes as a 19% vacancy rate is forcing the cafeteria workers to do more work than before. Two weeks ago, dozens of WCPSS school bus drivers called out sick for a three-day protest that disrupted bus service for many students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Defense Department’s internal watchdog said its investigation into a $400 million border wall contract found it was properly awarded to a North Dakota firm whose owner used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job. The Pentagon’s inspector general on Monday released results of the audit, requested last year by House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. He asked for the review of the contract awarded to Dickinson, North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that the company’s bid met standards and that the contract was awarded in accordance with federal procurement regulations. “We reviewed Fisher Sand and Gravel’s proposal, compared it to the solicitation, and agreed with (the Corps’) assessment that it was the LPTA (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable) and was properly awarded the contract,” the audit said. Company President Tommy Fisher is a GOP supporter and has appeared on conservative media touting his company as the best pick for building the wall that former President Donald Trump made a priority. The company was awarded a contract to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona but had little experience with such construction.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A transit officer who was captured on surveillance video shoving a 68-year-old man off a rail platform and onto the tracks in February has been charged. Patrick Rivera, 41, pleaded not guilty to three charges, including first-degree misdemeanor assault, on Saturday, cleveland.com reports. Rivera was placed on unpaid leave after charges were filed, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority spokesperson Linda Scardilli Krecic told the news outlet. Rivera was called to the site because the man refused to move his belongings when asked by a custodian, cleveland.com reports. Rivera wrote in a report that the man was aggressive and lunged at him, at which point he shoved the man. Video footage shows that the interaction happened quickly and that Rivera and another officer prevented the man from immediately climbing back up onto the platform even though trains were active on that track. Rivera wrote two citations for the man after he shoved him, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after a psychologist found the man was not competent to stand trial because of mental illness. Rivera was not fired or suspended because he signed an agreement with RTA that he would be fired if he “makes another mistake” in the next year. Former RTA Police Chief Michael Gettings called Rivera’s actions “unacceptable.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students across the metro area walked out of classes Wednesday in support of death row inmate Julius Jones, who is scheduled to be executed Thursday. Students at Northwest Classen, Classen SAS, Putnam City North, Harding Charter and John Marshall staged walkouts Wednesday morning. Students were seen congregating in parking lots and on football fields. The walkouts happened as Jones’ supporters awaited word from Gov. Kevin Stitt on whether he will grant Jones clemency ahead of his scheduled execution. Oklahoma City rapper and activist Jabee Williams, a longtime supporter of Jones, spoke to the students from Classen SAS, who marched about 10 blocks from their school to the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. “Julius loves you, he appreciates you, and he knows he is not alone,” Williams said. “What you guys did today was so brave.” He said there is a dark cloud hanging over Oklahoma right now. “If this man is executed, there’s a part of us that will be executed too. We won’t be the same,” Williams said. Greg Robinson, a community organizer and supporter of Jones from Tulsa, also praised the students for their walkout in support of Jones. “Why is it that a group of high schoolers,” Robinson said, “got more courage than the people that walk through this building?”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A philanthropist filed papers with the secretary of state on Tuesday to decriminalize sex work in Oregon, aiming to put the issue before voters in the 2022 election. “Sex worker rights are human rights, and the denial of those rights enables human trafficking,” said chief petitioner Aaron Boonshoft, who filed the prospective petition for the Sex Worker Rights Act. Advocates said Oregon’s laws that criminalize sex work make it difficult for workers to report rape, harassment and human trafficking to police, fearing they themselves could be arrested. Organizers of the effort said the proposal would end criminal penalties for participating in consensual adult sex work and add health and safety protections while maintaining laws against human trafficking. “Our current system is broken and harms sex workers,” said Anne Marie Backstrom, political director for the campaign. “Sex workers deserve to do their job without fear of arrest or violence, and, like all workers, they deserve access to health care, labor protections and public services.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A bill to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit was passed by a divided state House on Tuesday but faces a veto threat from the governor. The parties were split in the vote, as occurred in the state Senate last week, with Republicans mostly supporting it and Democrats mostly opposed. Supporters said that getting concealed carry permits under current law can be subject to the whims of county sheriffs and that permit holders can forget when their licenses expire and therefore unknowingly violate the law. Opponents pointed out the proposal is unlikely to be enacted, as Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s office said he will veto the legislation, and argued the bill would make people less safe by making guns more readily accessible. Pennsylvanians are generally allowed to openly carry loaded firearms, although current law is silent on it. Only in Philadelphia is a permit required for it. The legislation sent to Wolf would remove Philadelphia’s open-carry permit requirement, as well as the state’s requirement for people to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon, including for storing them in their cars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Civil rights organizations have sued the state’s Department of Corrections on behalf of a man who alleges his rights were violated when he was held in solitary confinement for eight months as punishment for his complaints about prison conditions. The Rhode Island Center for Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island sued the state’s corrections director and other prison administrators at the behest of Joseph Shepard, 28, on Monday. In the lawsuit, Shepard alleges his constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated when prison administrators put him in solitary confinement in retaliation for raising concerns. A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said the state disagreed that Shepard had served time in solitary confinement because the prison system “does not practice solitary confinement, as we have stated on the record numerous times.” Shepard claimed in the lawsuit that he brought concerns about prison conditions to administrators but was told to follow the formal grievance procedure. In response, Shepard sent documents to civil rights groups to bring attention to the cause. He was then placed in high-security segregation for eight months for being in possession of documents that had never been identified as contraband, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House will return to Columbia next month for a special session about redistricting. House Speaker Jay Lucas said the House will first meet at 2 p.m. Dec. 1 with the primary focus on approving the new state House, Senate and U.S. House districts based on 2020 U.S. census data. The chamber may also be in session Dec. 2 and Dec. 6 if necessary. The Senate hasn’t announced the dates it might meet in special session, but they are expected to gather in early December, too, because that would leave three months for legal challenges about the new maps to be resolved before filing for the new districts in the 2022 elections begins in March. The Legislature set aside only a few issues that can be taken up in the special session without a two-thirds vote. They include redistricting and spending billions of dollars in federal pandemic funds and from a settlement with the federal government over radioactive material stored past a deadline at the Savannah River Site. The list of items did not include COVID-19 vaccine or mask mandates. The General Assembly returns in January for the second year of its regular session.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem’s daughter says she’ll quit the real estate appraiser business following scrutiny over whether her mother used her influence to aid her application for an appraiser license. Kassidy Peters slammed a legislative inquiry and news reporting on the episode in a letter to Secretary of Labor Marcia Hultman on Tuesday. She also released a document that a legislative committee was seeking to subpoena. Lawmakers were zeroing in on the timeline of a meeting Noem called last year that included Peters and key decision-makers in a government agency that had moved days earlier to deny her application for an upgrade to her appraiser certification. “I am writing you today to express my disappointment and anger that my good name and professional reputation continue to be damaged by questions and misinformation concerning the Appraiser Certification Program,” Peters wrote to Hultman in the letter. She told Hultman she would turn in her license by the end of the year, adding: “I’m angry and I can acknowledge that this has successfully destroyed my business.” The Republican-dominated Government Operations and Audit Committee had requested the document to confirm Hultman’s assertion that state regulators had already decided to give Peters another chance to win her appraiser certification prior to the meeting in the governor’s mansion. Noem echoed that defense in a later news conference. But the signed agreement with Peters is dated the week after the July 27, 2020, meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Universities, transportation agencies and the operator of a national laboratory are among those landing exemptions to a new state law that strictly limits or prohibits most government entities and businesses from implementing COVID-19 prevention mandates. For some, approval was almost immediate. Six of the 19 entities that submitted requests Monday – the first day to apply – were granted exemptions to the new law’s stringent requirements. Tennessee now largely bars governments and businesses from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination and only lets schools and other public entities require masks in rare, dire public health situations. Exemptions also are allowed if groups can show they would lose federal funding by complying with the state law, which conflicts with policies implemented by President Joe Biden’s administration. Early exemptions have been given to Vanderbilt University, the University of Tennessee system, the University of Memphis, East Tennessee State University and UT-Batelle, which operates Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Crockett County Ambulance Service also was approved, though state officials noted that certain Medicare and Medicaid providers are already exempt. Other medical providers also applied.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrat Beto O’Rourke said Wednesday that he has raised more than $2 million after announcing his campaign for governor Monday, showing a persistent ability to quickly pile up cash after coming off failed runs for the U.S. Senate and presidency. The money came from more than 31,000 donations in the first 24 hours, with 57% of the contributions coming from Texas, spokesman Abhi Rahman said. Small donors have powered O’Rourke’s massive fundraising hauls in the past, but his campaign did not disclose a breakdown of contribution sizes so far. The numbers showed an early burst of enthusiasm for the former El Paso congressman, who in one day raised more money than the entire campaign of Democrats’ little-known candidate for Texas governor in 2018. But O’Rourke still has a long way to catch or even approach Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who this summer reported having at least $55 million in his campaign account, more than any incumbent governor in the country. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, routinely collects six-figure donations in big money from Texas executives. The Lone Star State’s sheer size makes mounting a statewide campaign costly, and Abbott and O’Rourke are likely to make this among the most expensive governor’s races in the country.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Gov. Spencer Cox cut the ceremonial opening ribbon Monday for a new business center. The Cedar City Business and Innovation Center is meant to provide a space for community members, students and businesses to come together to discuss entrepreneurial ideas, said Brennan Wood, president of Southwest Technical College. In a speech, Cox touted the center as a place that could be used as a “model” for other business centers to open in the state, saying he sees these centers as playing an important role in Utah’s economic future. “This is how we future-proof our education system,” he said. “It’s how we future-proof our economy. We do that by working together and innovating together.” The Cedar City center is located on the grounds of Southwest Technical College but isn’t technically an extension of the college, as the center had many other partners in its opening. Those include Southern Utah University, the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, the office of economic development for Cedar City and Iron County, and the Women’s Business Center of Utah. The center’s main mission is to help people handle the early challenges of starting a small business by offering office space, professional equipment, opportunities for business guidance and businesses classes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An audit has found that the cost of state employee health care jumped between 2010 and 2019 and urged changes to save money. The report released by State Auditor Doug Hoffer found that the cost of annual medical reimbursements for state employees, retirees and their families increased 51% in that time, from $94 million to $142 million. One reason the report identified for the increase was that different health providers charged different amounts for the same care. “The difference in prices paid for the exact same health care procedures under the State employee health plan is startling, especially since higher prices do not necessarily mean higher quality,” Hoffer said in a statement. The reports suggests that the state move to reference-based pricing, in which the state would set a maximum price it would pay for any service instead of paying the price negotiated by the health care provider and insurance company. Hoffer said that could save the state $16.3 million annually. A second suggestion is to provide state workers, retirees and their families with information about the cost of care and implement a cash incentive for them to use less expensive options. The report predicted this could save $202,000 annually if implemented for seven specific services.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A school board rescinded a directive for staff to pull books with “sexually explicit” books from libraries early Tuesday after hours of passionate public comment. The Spotsylvania County school board voted 5-2 to reverse the order amid public backlash, but some board members said they’ll continue to take a stance against the inclusion of what they view as offensive material in school library books, The Free Lance-Star reports. Board members Rabih Abuismail and Kirk Twigg, who spoke of burning books at last week’s meeting, did not support the reversal. “I think we should throw those books on the fire,” Abuismail said at the Nov. 8 school board meeting, while Twigg said many “would like to see the books before we burn them so we can identify within our community that we are eradicating this bad stuff.” Monday’s specially called meeting on the matter was held at the Chancellor High School auditorium to accommodate the large number of speakers expected. It stretched past midnight as dozens of parents, students, teachers and librarians spoke, most in support of libraries and books. Two speakers, both high school students, spoke in favor of removing books from library shelves. Comments were cut off at midnight.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The head of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission that failed to meet its deadline for redrawing political maps urged state Supreme Court justices to consider their work nonetheless now that the high court will have to complete the process. The panel had a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday to approve new boundaries for congressional and legislative districts following the 2020 census but acknowledged Tuesday that it had not been able to complete its task on time. This is the first time the panel has failed to finish its work on time since the state adopted a constitutional amendment giving redistricting authority to a bipartisan commission after the 1990 census. “While we acknowledge we missed the deadline for our maps to be considered by the Legislature, we see no reason why the Court can’t do so,” Commission Chair Sarah Augustine said in a statement late Tuesday night. “These maps reflect the input of the thousands of people who took part in the process with us. It would be a shame to see these maps go unconsidered simply because the clock struck 12.” Despite the plea to the Supreme Court, many were critical of the process by the panel – especially in the final hours Monday night, when there were complaints its deliberations were closed to the public and may have violated open meetings laws.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two trees to be displayed in the West Virginia Capitol during the holidays will feature photos recognizing military and first responders. West Virginians can submit photos to be displayed on the trees, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice and first lady Cathy Justice. The trees will be placed in the west rotunda of the main Capitol building. A third tree will be decorated by Gold Star mothers and families to honor people who died while serving the country. Photos will not be returned, and photocopies should be submitted. The military recognition form and the first responder recognition form and tag are available online. Photos, submission forms and tags must be received by Nov. 29. They can be submitted by email to first.lady@wv.gov or regular mail to attention of Katie Morris, West Virginia Governor’s Mansion, 1716 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two top state Republicans are criticizing mandatory University of Wisconsin-Madison sexual violence prevention training that includes references to privilege, identity and critical race theory. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Tuesday wrote a letter to the school chancellor demanding answers on why graduate students are required to watch the two-hour webinar that university spokesperson John Lucas said includes “a brief reference” to critical race theory, which he said is supported by academic research and noted in the citations. Critical race theory is an academic framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people. It has become a catchall political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history, and conservatives have seized on the concept to galvanize their base. Vos said it was “unacceptable” and “appalling” to mandate a class that “instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race.” Gubernatorial candidate and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch first drew attention to the training in a video she posted on Facebook last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: A small city in the top U.S. coal-mining state will be home to a Bill Gates-backed experimental nuclear power project near a coal-fired power plant that will soon close, officials announced Tuesday. Bellevue, Washington-based TerraPower will build its Natrium plant in Kemmerer, a southwestern Wyoming city of 2,600 where the coal-fired Naughton power plant operated by PacifiCorp subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power is set to close in 2025. “Our innovative technology will help ensure the continued production of reliable electricity while also transitioning our energy system and creating new, good-paying jobs in Wyoming,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a statement. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after officials from the U.S. and other countries pledged at a global climate-change summit in Scotland to continue working to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2019/08/15/barnegat-bay-dead-fish-poison-algae-lakewood-development/1569157001/", "title": "Barnegat Bay: Dead fish, poison algae may be its future.

Prisons have had to reformulate their lethal drug recipes after European drugmakers stopped shipping barbiturates and sedatives used in executions, raising a constitutional question of inmates' right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nA hearing on the constitutionality of Louisiana's proposed new protocol — a mixture of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller — is scheduled for April 7, where lawyers for the inmate will present pharmacologists and other experts to challenge the state's lethal cocktail, said Gary Clements, a lawyer for Sepulvado.\n\n\"We have severe questions,\" Clements said. \"We want to make sure they're giving us all the information they have.\"\n\nSepulvado, 70, was convicted of the 1992 murder of his 6-year-old stepson in Mansfield, La. Prosecutors said he beat the boy and stabbed him with a screwdriver before dunking him in a scalding hot bath.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday, officials of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections said, \"The Department has been committed throughout the entire process to following the court's direction and carrying out the sentence humanely and in accordance with the law.\"\n\nOther states are facing similar challenges. The family of an Ohio inmate executed last month is suing the state and a drug company, claiming Dennis McGuire was a victim of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" when he appeared to \"writhe in pain\" for 26 minutes before succumbing to the injected drugs. McGuire was injected with a similar mixture of midazolam and hydromorphone.\n\nAnd the Georgia Supreme Court is reviewing a case of a death row inmate who is challenging a state law shielding the identity and methods of companies that make the state's lethal injection drugs.\n\nThe new combinations of drugs raise questions of inmates' rights to know what drugs will lead to their deaths and avoid \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C., organization that opposes the death penalty. But prisons are being guarded with that information so as to not scare away more drugmakers, he said.\n\n\"Citizens, even convicted inmates, have an elementary right to know what's being done to them,\" Dieter said. \"You have a right to humane treatment.\"\n\nFor the past 30 years, U.S. prison officials used mostly sodium thiopental to carry out more than 1,000 lethal-injection executions, he said. But in 2011, U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped making the drug, citing complaints from officials in Italy, where the drug was made, that it was being used in capital punishment. Most prisons switched to pentobarbital until its Danish maker, Lundbeck, restricted its sale for executions, Dieter said.\n\nLouisiana ran out of its stock of pentobarbital and said last week it would switch to the midazolam-hydromorphone combination, prompting the court hearing.\n\nAs prisons' drug stocks dwindle, some states are considering reverting to previous methods, such as the electric chair or even a firing squad, said Tania Tetlow, a Tulane University Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. States switched to the more palatable lethal injection in the 1970s, but the electric chair and firing squad were never ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, she said.\n\nAs more states wrestle with lethal injection legality, the high court may revisit the death penalty issue, Tetlow said. \"It's an awkward conversation to have,\" she said. \"Even people who support the death penalty don't want to talk about the means.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2025/03/12/texas-execution-desert-killer-death-row-david-leonard-wood-stay-delay-el-paso/82304154007/", "title": "Texas 'Desert Killer' David Leonard Wood gets rare stay of execution", "text": "The highest court in Texas on Tuesday issued a rare stay of execution for David Leonard Wood, who has always denied being the so-called \"Desert Killer\" and reiterated his innocence in a recent hourlong interview with USA TODAY.\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued the stay \"until further order of this court\" without explanation. The order came just over 48 hours before Wood, 67, was set to be executed by lethal injection on Thursday.\n\nWood has been on Texas Death Row for nearly four decades even though no DNA evidence linked him to the murders of six women and girls in El Paso in 1987.\n\n“I’m accused of killing six people when an entire police force couldn’t find a single shred of evidence of anything,” Wood told USA TODAY on Feb. 26 during an interview at a Texas state prison north of Houston. “How can I not be angry at the corruption that put me here? How can you let people just dump cases on you and not be angry?”\n\nThe incredible move by the Texas court came almost simultaneously as a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily blocked that state's first nitrogen gas execution, scheduled for March 18, ruling that it could cause the inmate \"pain and terror\" and violate his constitutional rights.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Wood's case.\n\nMore from Texas death row: Robert Roberson again asks Texas' highest criminal court to free him, citing new evidence\n\nWhat was David Leonard Wood convicted of?\n\nA jury convicted Wood of killing six women and girls in 1987 in a case dubbed by local media as the \"Desert Killer.\" The victims are: 14-year-old Dawn Marie Smith, 15-year-old Desiree Wheatley, 17-year-old Angelica Frausto, 20-year-old Karen Baker, 23-year-old Ivy Susanna Williams, and 24-year-old Rosa Maria Casio.\n\nTheir bodies were all found in various states of decomposition in shallow graves in the same desert area in northeast El Paso. Investigators couldn’t determine how many of them were killed, though at least one had been strangled.\n\nPolice believed three missing girls – 12-year-old Melissa Alaniz, 14-year-old Marjorie Knox and 19-year-old Cheryl Vasquez-Dismukes − were also victims of the Desert Killer, but their bodies were never found.\n\nWood’s conviction was based mainly on circumstantial evidence. No DNA evidence has ever connected him to the murders.\n\nEl Paso Assistant District Attorney Karen Shook told jurors during trial that the “case in the totality points to David Wood.”\n\n\"It’s clear that the signature aspect of these murders was the shallow graves in this dark, isolated desert area,\" she said. \"It became the private graveyard of the defendant, David Wood.\"\n\nJurors heard testimony from two jailhouse informants who said Wood confessed to the killings, and a sex worker who said Wood raped her in the same desert area where the bodies were found and had begun digging her grave when a nearby noise startled him.\n\nWood, who was convicted of the sex worker’s rape, told USA TODAY that all three were lying and were only helping prosecutors in exchange for leniency in their own cases. “I’ve never confessed anything to anybody about anything,” he said.\n\nIn a recent court filing, Wood’s attorneys said that both jailhouse informants and the sex worker either got many years shaved off of prison sentences or were seeking a financial reward. The filing also details a statement from a man named George Hall, who described how El Paso police tried to get him to lie that Wood had confessed to the murders while they were jailed together.\n\nAdditional testimony came from a 26-year-old woman who said Wood raped her under an El Paso bridge when she was 13, according to archived coverage by the Associated Press at the time. Another woman testified that she was 12 when Wood lured her by saying he needed help finding a lost dog and then raped her at a nearby construction site, AP reported.\n\nThe state’s remaining evidence included testimony from witnesses saying they had seen some of the women and girls with Wood ahead of their murders and microscopic orange fibers that prosecutors argued connected one of the women’s bodies with Wood’s vacuum cleaner and a blanket in his truck.\n\nWhy was Wood's execution halted?\n\nSix of the justices voted to stay the execution, while Judge Mary Lou Keel and Judge Gina G. Parker voted against stopping it, records show. Judge Bert Richardson did not participate in the vote.\n\nWhile the justices' motivations remain unclear, Wood has claimed his constitutional rights were violated in the following ways:\n\nWood's claiming he is innocent.\n\nThe state obtained a conviction by presenting false testimony.\n\nThe suppression of evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland.\n\nClaims that the state destroyed evidence in violation of due process.\n\nWood's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.\n\nWood's counsel represented him while operating under an actual conflict of interest.\n\nWood's rights to a unanimous jury verdict.\n\nThe confrontation of witnesses.\n\nTexas court heard recent arguments from Wood's attorney\n\nWood’s attorney, Gregory Wiercioch, told USA TODAY last week that the state’s evidence connecting him to the murders is weak and criticized prosecutors for failing to test barely any of the items collected from the scene for DNA.\n\nOnly three pieces of evidence of hundreds were ever tested − fingernail scrapings from one victim and bloodstains on the clothing of two other victims. Tests on the fingernail scraping and one of the bloodstains were inconclusive. The other bloodstain belonged to a man but couldn’t have been Wood’s, new DNA testing obtained by defense attorneys in 2010 found.\n\n“This is a serial murder case, a case with six victims, and in a serial murder case, I would expect the government, the state, to have a mountain of evidence − direct evidence tying David Wood to these victims, and there’s not,” Wiercioch said. “It’s incomprehensible to me how little evidence there is.”\n\nWiercioch filed recent actions seeking to stop the execution with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Feb. 21. That court, the same one that issued Tuesday's stay of execution, rejected previous requests for more DNA testing.\n\n\"To this day, it is still mind-boggling why (the state) didn’t agree to more testing,\" Wiercioch said. \"I think they’re afraid of what they would find. If they believe David Wood is the desert serial murderer, then why are they afraid of additional testing? We’ve never tested anything other than those three items out of 135, and one excluded David Wood. That’s very troubling.\"\n\nThe Texas Attorney General’s Office has not responded to repeated requests for comment from USA TODAY. The El Paso District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment about the strength of the evidence, saying it recused itself from the matter in 1993 over a conflict of interest.\n\nWood sees second stay of execution\n\nThis isn't the first time Wood's execution has been delayed. Just 24 hours before his scheduled execution in 2009, it was halted due to claims that Wood was intellectually disabled and therefore not fit for the death penalty, NBC News reports. A judge has since rejected the claims.\n\nHow do the victims' families feel about the stay?\n\nJolieen Denise Gonzalez, 17-year-old victim Angelica Frausto's sister, told USA TODAY that Tuesday’s development was “fair.”\n\n“I don’t think he should die for my sister's murder,” Gonzalez said. “I do not believe that I’m going to live to see my sister get justice.”\n\nShe previously told USA TODAY that she thought Wood helped plan her sister's murder but didn't kill her himself.\n\nBut Marcia Fulton, mother of 15-year-old victim Desiree Wheatley, told USA TODAY that she was disappointed in the stay but not surprised.\n\nFulton was planning to drive 720 miles from El Paso to Huntsville to witness Wood’s execution on Thursday.\n\n\"I’m waiting for justice for my daughter because I promised her that at her gravesite. Each time this happens, it breaks my heart again, that I can't follow through,\" Fulton said. \"Victims have no justice system. Disappointed yes, but it's not like I am waiting for him to die.\"\n\nSouth Carolina sees first firing squad execution in modern history\n\nThe execution of a death row inmate in South Carolina made national news last week.\n\nBrad Keith Sigmon on Friday for the beating deaths of his ex-girlfriend's parents, marking the first firing squad execution in the state in modern history and the first in the U.S. since 2010.\n\nHow does a firing squad execution work? Brad Keith Sigmon executed in South Carolina in 'bloody spectacle'\n\n— USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/28/pancake-record-battered-sea-tortoise-tourist-coronado-motel-news-around-states/118974670/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal judge paved the way for Alabama to proceed with a lethal injection next month, but also reprimanded the state attorney general’s office for giving false information to the court during the litigation centered on forms given to death-row inmates for selecting an execution method. Chief U.S. District Judge Emily C. Marks dismissed a lawsuit that argued the state failed to give Willie Smith, who has an IQ below 75, required help under the Americans with Disabilities Act in filling out forms that affected the timing of his execution. Smith is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 21 by lethal injection for the 1991 kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham. After Alabama authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, the state gave death row inmates a brief window to select that as their execution method. The state has not yet developed a protocol for using nitrogen hypoxia and is not setting execution dates for inmates who requested it. Smith did not turn in a form selecting nitrogen. His attorneys argued that the state was required by law to help intellectually disabled inmates like Smith with the form. Marks dismissed the claim, saying the form was not required by state law and that Smith could have have written on his own to request nitrogen.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state plans to emphasize telework for state employees for the next month as the COVID-19 pandemic strains Alaska’s health care system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a memo to state department leaders last week, said the state “must take measures to protect its health care infrastructure while still providing essential government services to its residents.” He wrote that, effective Monday, the state will emphasize telework “to the maximum extent practical, while still maintaining public facing presence and services.” This is to be in effect until Oct. 29, he said. A determination on any possible extensions will be made later, he said. Brian Penner, director of the union that represents supervisory employees, told the Anchorage Daily News the decision was welcomed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Gov. Doug Ducey has ousted and replaced all five members of the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy in the wake of a newspaper’s critical report about the occupational regulatory panel’s handling of complaints about alleged sexual abuse by therapists. Ducey’s announcement Friday didn’t mention the Arizona Republic’s Sept. 15 investigative report that the board was lax in disciplining therapists accused of abuse, but he said it was crucial that the board “protects massage clients, especially those who are in a vulnerable position.” The announcement also said Ducey’s appointments implemented legislation enacted in 2020 to have the massage board and certain other regulatory panels have majorities of public members once current members’ terms expired. Public members are people not in the regulated occupations. Ducey noted that three of the five new members have experience in victim advocacy and support. The other two are licensed massage therapists with more than 25 years of experience.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:A new individualized-approached, tuition-free charter school will open for Fort Smith high school students next year. The Premier High School-Fort Smith will start enrolling in May and start its first school year in August, said Dennis Felton, state director of Premier schools. The school offers an educational environment that is individualized and small by design, according to the Premier website. “(It’s) for students when traditional school isn’t a fit for them,” said Jake Kurz, director of communications for Responsive Ed. “Sometimes that means a schedule and sometimes that means they need to recover credits (from where) they got behind. Sometimes that means they want to graduate early.” The school's curriculum is more student mastery-based, giving them a chance to work at their pace as opposed to a teacher’s pace, Felton said. The school offers different sessions for students so they can deal with a job or attend to other obligations if needed, Kurz said. The first Premier high school in Arkansas opened in Little Rock in 2013. The Fort Smith school will mark the fourth location in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: U.S. Rep Karen Bass, D-Calif., intends to launch a campaign for Los Angeles mayor, joining a field of candidates that has rapidly grown over the last week, according to three people familiar with her plans. Such a move would deliver another shakeup to a contest that had been a sleepy affair for much of the year. Bass, a high-profile Democrat who has served in Sacramento and Washington, could announce her entry into the mayor’s race as early as this week, those sources told the Los Angeles Times. If Bass enters the race, she would be a formidable competitor, said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who described himself as an ally of Bass since 1978.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:The Coronado Motel, once one of the few spots in the city Black travelers could rely on for safe accommodation – it was one of a handful of places listed in “The Negro Traveler’s Green Book,” a guidebook that identified facilities hospitable to Black guests during the Jim Crow era – received the Stephen H. Hart Award from History Colorado’s State Historical Fund for its commercial, architectural and ethnic significance. It is one of five sites in Colorado to receive the award this year. The motel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places last year. The owners of the then-Coronado Lodge began officially listing the motel in the Green Book in 1957. The Green Book listed hotels, service stations, restaurants, drug stores and other locations that were safe ports of call for Black travelers, who faced discrimination and the threat of harm while traveling throughout the segregated country. Victor Hugo Green published the book annually until just after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 70 members of the Connecticut National Guard were honored Saturday for their service after completing nearly one-year tours of duty. A welcome home ceremony was held for members of the Middletown-based 143rd Regional Support Group and several members of Detachment 2, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 641st Aviation Regiment at the state armory in Hartford. The Middletown-based soldiers supported Operation Spartan Shield in Jordan from October 2020 to July 2021, overseeing base operations and contracts at various facilities. The Windsor Locks-based aviation regiment conducted 166 C-12 air movement missions throughout eastern Africa in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa from September 2020 to July 2021. “These soldiers left their homes and families during a very difficult time in this country to answer the nation’s call and support U.S. security interests abroad,” Maj. Gen. Francis Evon said in a written statement. “We thank them for their sacrifice and their families who took care of the home front for almost a year. It’s always a great feeling when we get to welcome our people back home after completion of a successful mission.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings has filed a lawsuit against chemical company Monsanto and spinoffs Solutia and Pharmacia, alleging long-lasting damage to the state’s natural resources. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court last Wednesday alleged Monsanto knew as early as 1937 that polychlorinated biphenyls had systemic toxic effects on humans and animals and it seeks to recover damages and clean-up costs, Jennings said in a news release. “Monsanto knew that PCBs were toxic and that once they entered the environment, they would be there to stay,” Jennings said. “Even as PCBs’ environmental harms became undeniable, Monsanto not only continued to manufacture and sell PCBs, but increased production. Now, decades since PCBs were banned, Delaware taxpayers are still footing the cleanup bill. We’re suing Monsanto and its spinoffs to make them pay to clean up their mess.” The suit also claims Monsanto understood and “actively promoted the fact that PCBs do not naturally break down; and continued to manufacture, market and sell PCBs despite full awareness of these dangers.” Bayer, which purchased Monsanto in 2016, responded to the lawsuit saying the company voluntarily ceased all PCB production in 1977, two years before production was banned, The News-Journal reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Students at George Washington University continue to voice concerns about possible mold exposure on campus. In early September, the university ordered 175 students to temporarily evacuate their housing in Townhouse Row, along 23rd Street NW, because of environmental concerns. According to Maralee Csellar, director of communications at George Washington University, a team that inspected the housing identified conditions “conducive to biological growth”. The university did not say it had discovered mold. Around the same time of that investigation, another GW student also claimed he and his roommates had found a mold-like substance in Shenkman Hall, which is a residential tower located across the street from Townhouse Row. Shenkman resident and GW sophomore Luc Saint-Genies said his roommates were coughing for over a week after they found the material in parts of their living unit. Saint-Genies said he and his roommates were recently moved by the university to emergency housing at the River Inn hotel in Foggy Bottom after GW’s facilities division conducted an inspection of their residence. GW moved Townhouse Row students to two hotels, including the River Inn, after its inspection of that site as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral:Space Florida, the state’s spaceport authority and aerospace development agency, is investigating what it will take to bring more Space Force operations to Brevard County, an area already home to two military installations, NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, and dozens of commercial spaceflight companies. The branch established in late 2019 still needs to make decisions on where to establish some operations like training centers. Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station were among the first former Air Force facilities to be renamed as Space Force installations. Much like the Marine Corps falls under the purview of the Navy, the Space Force is positioned under Air Force leadership. Mark Bontrager, Space Florida’s vice president for spaceport operations, said, Florida could be an ideal location for training facilities, or what are known as technical schools. Tech schools usually come immediately after basic training and prepare new military members – in this case, Space Force guardians – for their specific roles. Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles, California, was already selected for the first of five STARCOM sub-commands, or “deltas,” but more selections are expected in the coming months. Its command headquarters, however, is still up for grabs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: Leaders on one of Georgia’s most popular coastal islands are considering letting developers build closer to sand dunes. The Brunswick News reported that a planning commission that governs construction on St. Simons Island is discussing reducing the required setback for new construction in areas with active dunes from 40 feet to 25 feet. The new rule would increase the required setback from 20 feet to 25 feet for an area without dunes. Commissioners agreed Tuesday to postpone action until November to allow time for a public workshop. The idea originated from a planning commission meeting with Glynn County commissioners to discuss growth on the island. Glynn County Commissioner Cap Fendig said the proposed changes would match Georgia Department of Natural Resources rules. Current Glynn County rules are more restrictive. Dunes can protect beaches and inland areas and also provide habitat for plants and wildlife. Alice Keyes of the environmental group One Hundred Miles said rising sea levels make setbacks even more important.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The island of Kauai is planning to revise its coronavirus restriction structure as the delta variant continues to impact the county. Mayor Derek Kawakami said officials will continue to enforce strict COVID-19 safety measures even as the state approaches a vaccination rate of 70%, a milestone earlier set for loosening rules under a tiered reopening plan, The Garden Island reported Friday. “Throughout this pandemic, we have adjusted to the changing realities of COVID-19, and we continually work to keep our community safe while doing everything we can to keep our businesses and activities open,” Kawakami said. Changes will need to be approved by Gov. David Ige. The current tier system would have allowed for all restrictions, including business capacity rules and gathering sizes, to be dropped when the population was 70% vaccinated. About 67% of state residents and 65% of Kauai residents are fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene:, The Coeur d’Alene School District’s Board of Trustees canceled a special meeting on Friday to consider a temporary COVID-19 mask mandate after protesters swarmed the building. The crowd gathered outside of the Midtown Center Meeting Room at 1 p.m., KREM-TV reported. The meeting agenda included a reopening plan for the 2021-2022 school year, including masking and quarantine. Earlier this month, the board adopted a plan that strongly recommended masks be worn in schools. The school district has seen hundreds of positive COVID-19 cases since the first day of school Sept. 7. The meeting was postponed officials said for safety reasons after the crowd banged on doors and shouted at police. A video tweeted by a reporter for KREM showed a large group of people standing outside of the meeting room chanting, “No more masks.” Estimated at up to 200 people, the group then moved to the district’s administrative center, which was placed on lockdown for safety precautions. Many protesters said school board members should be fired for refusing to hold the meeting.\n\nIllinois\n\nEast Moline: Inmates at East Moline Correctional Center have begun a Bachelor of Arts program through Augustana College. State officials said 10 students began studies late in the summer. They are taking courses from professors who lecture on the same subjects on Augustana’s Rock Island campus. It’s the first BA program offered East Moline inmates in more than 20 years. The initial program offers a communications studies major with other majors to be added. The liberal arts curriculum includes history, literature, math, foreign languages, religion, science and the arts. Illinois Department of Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys said a college degree is key to those in custody who want to change their lives and provide financially for their families. Augustana modeled its program after the Bard Prison Initiative. It was featured in the 2019 PBS documentary “College Behind Bars.” Students in the Augustana Prison Education Program pay no tuition or any costs associated with coursework. The program is funded by the Austin E. Knowlton Foundation.\n\nIndiana\n\nGreenwood: Another Indiana school board meeting was disrupted when residents refused to wear face masks while objecting to the district’s requirement. Sheriff’s deputies were called to the Center Grove school board meeting last Thursday night after those not wearing masks wouldn’t leave so the meeting could start, the (Franklin) Daily Journal reported. Those protesting left after two deputies arrived. A similar disruption happened in the southern Indianapolis suburbs as the Clark-Pleasant board meeting in Whiteland was adjourned after just two minutes last week because some people refused to wear masks. State officials have allowed mask rules and other steps to stem COVID-19 spread even as several school boards have faced vocal – and sometimes misleading – opposition to such actions. A man was arrested in July when a handgun fell from his pocket during a Carmel school board meeting, The Bartholomew Consolidated school board in Columbus decided this past week it will hold meetings virtually because of parent conduct. Center Grove’s board could make a similar move, district Superintendent Rich Arkanoff said.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville:Residents gathered to help break a syrupy Guinness World Record on Saturday by plating 14,280 pancakes in a single-serving. A Hy-Vee store in Blue Springs, Missouri, a Kansas City suburb, set the record of 13,000 pancakes in June. Hy-Vee donated 2,400 pounds of pancake mix to help residents break the record during Centerville’s Pancake Day celebration. The Guinness World Record attempt took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. Pancake Day started in 1948 as a way for manufacturers, including a Pillsbury facility, across Centerville show appreciation for their employees by giving them free pancakes. Community members took on the event and turned it into a regional celebration as manufacturers left Centerville. The town typically serves about 17,000 pancakes on Pancake Day, said Centerville Tourism Director Delaney Evers. This year, pancakes had to be made to strict specifications of at least 5 inches in diameter, but no more than 1 centimeter in thickness. About 100 people volunteered to accomplish the feat.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: A suburban Kansas City school district is investigating after a student asked a girl to homecoming using an offensive sign. The sign reads: “If I was Black I would be picking cotton but I’m white so I’m picking you for HOCO.” A picture of two white students holding the sign and smiling that was posted online drew sharp criticism on social media, according to the Kansas City Star. School officials in Olathe said they are working to contact everyone involved, including the parents of the students. “The type of behavior displayed in the social media post does not meet the expectations of our core values,” Olathe South High School Principal Dale Longenecker said in a letter sent to parents. “Any behavior like this will be immediately addressed in accordance with our Student Code of Conduct.” A copy of the photo posted on Twitter was criticized by the Arizona Cardinals Isaiah Simmons’, who grew up in Olathe. “This is disgusting. Sad that people think this is funny or acceptable,” he wrote. “Very disappointing and honestly just sad to see this kind of stuff happening in my hometown. I hope this is handled in the correct manner.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Horse Soldier Bourbon plans to create more than 50 jobs with a new $200 million tourism project in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The Pulaski County site will contain a 27,585-square-foot distillery visitor center; 5,000-person amphitheater; 500-person outdoor event space; 3,200-square-foot wedding chapel; and an activity center, shops and more. Horse Soldier Bourbon was founded by retired members of the U.S. Special Forces who were among the first to enter Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The company has been approved by the Kentucky Tourism Development Finance Authority for $29.9 million in incentives for the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGrand Isle: Grand Isle officials said the narrow barrier island is closed to all but people who live there or those who own camps there as residents try to recover from Hurricane Ida’s devastating impacts. In a posting on the town’s website Saturday, officials said the widespread devastation caused the town council and the mayor to make the decision to close the island, which is a destination spot for fishing and vacation getaways. “The decision to close the island was a difficult one,” said Mayor David Camardelle in the announcement, “but it is in everyone’s best interest.” Ida came ashore on Aug. 29 just a few miles away near Port Fourchon. The Category 4 hurricane’s ferocious winds and storm surge destroyed the city’s electrical infrastructure. The town said in its announcement that 80% of the structures on the island sustained damage. According to the post, about 200 personnel from various agencies are on the island specifically to help with the recovery. That number is expected to increase as energy provider, Entergy, works to restore the grid, the statement said. But Grand Isle residents have vowed to come back, despite the damage.\n\nMaine\n\nHampden: The northbound stretch of a $45 million bridge replacement project in the Bangor area is almost finished. The project is called the Hampden Bridge Bundle. The Maine Department of Transportation said it planned to shift traffic onto the fourth of four new northbound Interstate 95 bridges on Monday. The transportation department said traffic is still using three temporary bridges to accommodate construction work on the southbound side of the highway. The department said more southbound traffic shifts are expected, and the project will continue into next year. The entire project requires rebuilding eight bridges and rehabilitating a ninth along a 4-mile stretch of the interstate in Hampden.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four enormous container cranes have arrived in their new home in Baltimore after a two-month trip from China. The cranes, which are some of the tallest in the world, squeezed under the Chesapeake Bay and Key Bridges on their way to the Port of Baltimore, stopping traffic on the spans on Sept. 9, news outlets reported. Each crane is about 450 feet tall, about 25 feet taller than the current cranes, port officials said. With the cranes hanging off each side of the ship, they were about 176 feet tall, leaving just about 10 feet of clearance under the bridges, according to the state and Coast Guard. The new cranes will help double the port’s container capacity once the Howard Street Tunnel is expanded to allow freight trains to carry containers stacked two-high. Ports America Chesapeake, which runs the Seagirt Marine Terminal under a lease with the state, purchased the massive cranes, which will allow longshoremen to unload two even larger and wider container ships at once. The 1,740-ton cranes can reach 23 containers across a container ship and each can lift 187,500 pounds of cargo at once.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLowell: A University of Massachusetts Lowell researcher has received a $2.7 million federal grant to continue her research into the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The National Institutes of Health grant will help engineering associate professor Joyita Dutta look at the disease from a network perspective, viewing the interconnections between the regions of the brain, the university said in a statement last week. She will use machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to build models from existing patient imaging data. She aims to develop models that predict the progression of primary protein markers for Alzheimer’s disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 5.8 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s last year. That number is projected to rise to 14 million by 2060. There is no known cure for the disease.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast China Township:Three years after DTE Energy paid more than $5,000 to relocate rare milkweed plants at its future Blue Water Energy Center site in East China Township, the plants are thriving. Daniel Okon, a DTE Energy senior environmental specialist, said 400 Sullivant’s milkweed stems were relocated in 2018 and the population has grown to 502 stems. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch butterfly, a candidate under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Milkweed and flowering plants are needed for monarch habitat. Adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many flowers, but they breed only where milkweeds are found, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Sullivant’s milkweed differs from common milkweed, with smooth leaves instead of the common variety’s rough leaves, and a pink vein pressed closely to the stems. Sullivant’s milkweed is classified as threatened and legally protected in Michigan. It has been observed in eight Michigan counties with the most occurrences found in St. Clair County, according to scientific biodiversity resource the Michigan Natural Features Inventory.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz proposed a $10 million relief package for farmers who suffered losses because of drought across most of Minnesota this summer – a plan that would require a special legislative session to approve. The Democratic governor’s proposal includes $5 million in rapid response grants for livestock producers and specialty crop growers for costs of water-related equipment such as tanks, pipelines, wells, water wagons and irrigation equipment. It also includes $5 million for zero-interest disaster recovery loans for losses not covered by insurance. But Walz said he’s still insisting that Senate Republicans agree not to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm if he calls lawmakers back for a special session that was already in the works for a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Negotiators from the House Democratic and Senate GOP majorities and the Walz administration missed a Labor Day target for agreeing to which workers are most deserving and how much money they should get. Republicans so far have not backed off a threat to use the Senate’s confirmation powers to oust Malcolm over the administration’s pandemic response. Walz called on them to “put the political posturing and things aside” and get both packages done without ousting his health commissioner.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A hospital in the Mississippi Delta has been losing millions of dollars a year, and its CEO said the problems are exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic as nurses, laboratory technicians and respiratory therapists are being hired by out-of-state hospitals for short-term contract work at higher salaries. Leaders of Greenwood Leflore Hospital held closed-door hearings in the past week to brief local officials and its employees about proposals for a financial turnaround. CEO Jason Studley said no layoffs or terminations are anticipated, although some positions might not be filled as employees leave, the Greenwood Commonwealth reported. Studley told the newspaper he would publicly release details of the financial plan in the coming week. The hospital has about 1,000 employees and is owned by the city of Greenwood and Leflore County. Local government officials asked for Tuesday’s meeting. “I think we’re on the right track to move forward,” said Leflore County Supervisor Sam Abraham after emerging from the closed-door session with the hospital board and top administrators. The hospital has spent nearly all of the $25 million in federal pandemic relief money. For the first 11 months of the current budget year, it has lost $13.2 million, even after using $11 million in federal grant money. For the same period last year, the loss was $755,000 when $15.5 million in coronavirus grant money was used. The hospital started the current budget year with $52.8 million cash on hand. By the end of August, it had $28.3 million.\n\nMissouri\n\nWoodson Terrace: The FBI has opened an investigation into the arrest of a Black man during which cellphone video showed three white officers allowing a police dog to repeatedly bite him. Woodson Terrace police Chief Randy Halstead said in an email to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his department was “fully cooperating” with the investigations being conducted by the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office into last week’s arrest. Federal officials and St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell declined to discuss their investigations with the newspaper. Officers were called Monday morning to a report that a man had broken into a business in Woodson Terrace, according to a police statement posted on Facebook. The man appeared to be on drugs and threatened officers, and they warned him the dog would be used if he continued to resist arrest, the department wrote. Cellphone video from an onlooker showed the dog biting the man’s foot as he yells. The dog’s handler holds it by a leash but allows the biting to go on for about 30 seconds. After the officer pulls off the dog, the man appears to take a step but stumbles and the dog lunges at him again, biting a leg for another 30 seconds until the officer stops the animal. The man was treated at a hospital and released. He hasn’t been charged with any crimes. Protesters gathered outside the Woodson Terrace Police Department on Friday to demand the firing and prosecution of the three officers.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A coalition including worker unions and a disability rights group filed a lawsuit last Wednesday against Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over a law passed earlier this year that eliminates same-day voter registration. The lawsuit was filed by the Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana AFL-CIO, the Montana Association of Centers for Independent Living, and several citizens. Montana Federal of Public Employees president Amanda Curtis called the law “a slap in the face” to the tens of thousands of Montana residents who use same-day voter registration and to the majority of Montanans who voted to maintain election-day registration when the question was on the ballot in 2014. “People who work for a living do not always have the privilege to register to vote or address their issues with their registration during the regular business hours,” said Montana AFL-CIO Executive Secretary James Holbrook. County election offices are open later on Election Day. Montana Independent Living Project advocacy coordinator Joel Peden said same-day registration eases the experience of people living with disabilities by saving the need for two trips to election offices. Republicans who supported the measure have said the law would help election officials conduct elections more efficiently while reducing long lines and voter frustration on election day. Secretary of State spokesman Richie Melby called the lawsuit “completely baseless.” This is the fourth lawsuit challenging the same law passed earlier this year by the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\nNebraska\n\nDakota City: The owners of a defunct biogas plant in northeast Nebraska have agreed to pay a $1.1 million fine to the state and federal governments for repeated violations of environmental rules. Big Ox Energy and its owners agreed to pay the fine as part of a settlement with regulators. The company and its insurers previously agreed to be part of a separate $1.75 million settlement with homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. “The Big Ox facility’s operations presented a significant risk to their workers and nearby property owners,” said acting regional EPA Administrator Edward H. Chu. The EPA said that some of the liquid wastewater went over the sides of the facility’s roof and onto the ground at least 16 times between 2017 and 2019. On one occasion in 2018, a malfunction at the plant resulted in 80,000 gallons of liquid wastewater overflowing from its equipment. At times the plant was also discharging methane at levels that could be flammable and hydrogen sulfide in amounts that could cause injury or death if it was inhaled.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Great Basin Institute has been awarded a $160,000 federal grant to establish a professional recreational trail building school, which would be the first of its kind in the nation. The funds came from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The proposed school will be in Ely. The hope is to draw outdoor recreation professionals from all over the U.S. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto praised the idea of the school. She said it will enhance Nevada’s reputation as an outdoor recreation destination, create more jobs and give students practical experience. Kyle Horvath, director of White Pine County Tourism and Recreation, said Ely is an ideal spot with its proximity to the Mountain West.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is making some of its pandemic-related graduation ceremony changes permanent. The school traditionally has held one large ceremony in its outdoor football stadium, but because of the pandemic, it divided seniors up by their colleges and held a handful of separate ceremonies. That gave students the chance to walk across the stage and receive their diplomas instead of being recognized all at once, and officials have decided to keep that practice going forward. Starting in May, commencement exercises will be moved indoors to the Whittemore Center and graduates will be split up by academic college, the Foster’s Daily Democrat reported.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Construction of a nearly 120-mile-long proposed natural gas pipeline from northeastern Pennsylvania to central New Jersey will not go forward, the group behind the project said Monday. PennEast Pipeline Company, which won a recent legal fight against New Jersey at the Supreme Court, nonetheless said the state has failed to provide certain permits and is putting the project on ice. “PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the Project no longer is supported. Accordingly, PennEast has ceased all further development of the Project,” spokesperson Pat Kornick said in an email. The decision is the latest swing in a long-running effort to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. It’s also a major victory for environmental groups who opposed the project, arguing it would cut a scar across the landscape, threaten wildlife and contribute the use of fossil fuels. PennEast, a company made up of five energy firms, won federal and Pennsylvania permitting approvals including a key Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate that could allow the firm to use eminent domain to acquire land. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court said companies building interstate pipelines can obtain the land they need even in the face of state opposition, once their projects have been given the green light by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Trump and Biden administrations had supported PennEast. Nineteen states had urged the Supreme Court to rule the other way and side with New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Rio Rancho Public Schools canceled classes Monday because of an internet service outage. Officials sent a letter to parents Sunday saying a damaged fiber optic circuit was causing the outage. With no internet, some key systems that involve safety and student transportation would be at risk. District officials said contractors are coming from out of state to do the repairs. Classes were expected to resume Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has stopped paying legal bills for employees who worked for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as he faces ongoing investigations on the state and federal levels. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s spokesperson Haley Viccaro said last Wednesday that the state stopped paying for those aides’ legal bills after Sept. 2. The administration is now deciding whether there is a legal basis for the state to pay bills for legal services on or before Sept. 2. Viccaro did not specify how many staffers had legal bills paid for by the state. Cuomo and his former aides face an ongoing investigation by the state attorney general into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote about his leadership during the pandemic and scrutiny from federal prosecutors who are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. Cuomo is also facing a state ethics commission inquiry. The state has agreed to pay a maximum of $9.5 million in bills for attorneys representing Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, as well as for attorneys investigating the former governor and his administration, according to the Associated Press’ review of available contracts. That figure includes up to $5 million for attorneys who have represented Cuomo’s office. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, Rita Glavin, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A construction company founded by former NFL players and brothers Torry and Terrence Holt will build a project designed to honor the contributions of African Americans in North Carolina. Leaders of the North Carolina Freedom Park initiative announced Monday that the Black-owned Holt Brothers Construction has been awarded the contract to complete the $5.4 million project in Raleigh. The park, to be located between the Executive Mansion and the Legislative Building. will be anchored by the Beacon of Freedom, a piece of public art that will be illuminated at night. Freedom Park’s leaders broke ground last fall on the park, which is expected to be completed by next year. The Holts grew up in Gibsonville and played at North Carolina State University. Torry Holt was an All-America wide receiver and played on the Super Bowl-winning St. Louis Rams in 2000. The brothers’ construction company has completed other projects such as a Durham County library renovation and North Carolina Central University’s new student center. Freedom Park was designed by the late architect Phil Freelon, who also designed the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, and the Durham firm Perkins & Will.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota’s only congressman, is in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus. Armstrong said in a Twitter post Sunday that he had been experiencing mild coronavirus symptoms and took a test which came back positive. The 44-year-old Republican said he has been vaccinated. “I have been fully vaccinated since January, and I am taking all precautions and recovering at home in North Dakota. I have been advised by my doctor to quarantine for ten days,” Armstrong wrote. Armstrong said he has contacted friends in Congress and will be casting his votes this week by proxy, as Capitol Hill gears up for a busy week that includes a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package. “Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to be in D.C. next week,” Armstrong wrote. “However, the votes we are taking are simply too important to miss, so I have reached out to friends in Congress and I will be casting my votes by proxy.”\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:Summa Health is reducing inpatient hospital beds by more than 20% and temporarily stopping some elective surgeries while the Akron-based health system tries to adjust to a nationwide staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a memo distributed to staff at 9 a.m. Monday, hospital executives said Summa would make multiple adjustments to help the care of patients as health care staff at Summa and nationwide are in some cases burned out and leaving the health care field. “We are no longer able to maintain the current level of capacity in our hospitals and we must make adjustments to align with the current level of clinical staff,” Summa executives said. The following measures will go into effect immediately: adjusting the combined inpatient bed capacity at Akron City and Barberton hospitals from 551 to about 430 by Oct. 24; the number of available inpatient beds will be cut from 439 to about 350 at Akron City Hospital and 112 to 80 at Barberton Hospital; improve Emergency Department flow by embeding specialists, primary care physicians and/or hospitalists in the emergency department on the Akron and Barberton campuses to initiate care more efficiently. There will be no changes at St. Thomas Hospital, which treats Summa’s behavioral health patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:A northwest Oklahoma City church hopes to become a transitional living community to temporarily house individuals experiencing homelessness and provide support to help them find permanent housing and a brighter future. Clark Memorial United Methodist Church wants to build up to 20 small structures similar to tiny homes or tiny housing units on its property. The Rev. Bo Ireland, the church’s senior pastor, is also executive director of what is being called the Lazarus Community at Clark Memorial. The name of the new housing community comes from well-known scripture which told the story of Jesus raising a man named Lazarus from the dead. “It’s a ministry that will be bringing back those who are homeless to a restored state,” Ireland said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Despite a threat to block new political maps, Republican state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday – the final day for the Legislature to complete redistricting. Enough GOP lawmakers returned to the House floor to achieve a quorum required to vote. With the Republican reverse, it is likely Democrats will pass new district maps – including a sixth, U.S. House seat. Congressional plans were sent to the redistricting committee on Monday morning to be formally adopted and the House was scheduled to reconvene at 1 p.m. Although Oregon Democrats hold the majority in both legislative chambers, they don’t have enough seats to vote without a few Republicans present. As the House convened Monday morning,47 of 60 House members were present – 40 lawmakers are needed to meet quorum. The Oregon Legislature had until the end of the day on Monday to participate in the once-a-decade job of redrawing the state’s congressional and legislative districts in accordance with new U.S. Census numbers. If lawmakers missed the deadline, the job of redrawing congressional maps would fall to a panel of five current and former judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court, and Democratic Secretary of State Shemia Fagan will be tasked with redrawing the state’s legislative districts. On Saturday, Republicans in the House did not show up for a floor session, upset that Democratic House Speaker Tina Kotek earlier this week rescinded a deal she made with them to split power in the redistricting debate, even though Democrats have large majorities in the Senate and House.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Transgender women in Pennsylvania tried again Monday to knock down state rules that govern legal name changes for people with felony records. The state requires them to wait two years after completing their sentence to apply for a name change. People who have committed the most serious felonies, including rape and murder, are barred from changing their legal names. The 1998 rules are meant to enhance public safety and thwart fraud attempts. However, advocates said the transgender community simply wants the right to use names that match their identities rather than their dead or given names. Gabriel Arkles, senior counsel of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, said his clients risk being harassed if they apply for jobs, or are stopped by police, and show identification that doesn’t match their gender identities. “For the people it affects, it has such a profound affect,” Arkles said. “Our clients are transgender people who are just trying to live their lives and are not trying to commit any fraud.” Similar efforts have been underway in other states, with varying degrees of success, he said. Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court, which handles cases involving state agencies, dismissed a related lawsuit last year on procedural grounds without addressing the underlying constitutional claims.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An open government coalition is asking Democratic Gov. Dan McKee to allow public agencies to hold meetings online because of a surge of COVID-19 infections. ACCESS/RI said it sent a letter to McKee asking him to issue an executive order because his previous order to waive the requirement that members of public bodies meet in person expired in July. Since then, the coalition said, some public bodies have had difficulty getting enough members to attend in person for a quorum and some members of the public have been reluctant to attend. “Members of the public face a choice between their health and their ability to participate in our democracy,” the coalition said. State legislatures in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts codified similar executive orders to allow for online meetings until the spring, the coalition added. Rhode Island’s legislature considered allowing online meetings until July 2023, which ACCESS/RI opposed because of the length of time and the belief that in-person meetings should be the default.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: Crews are getting ready to start restoring windows in a century-old building in Beaufort that were damaged by hurricanes over the past several years. The work on the 29 windows of the Carnegie Library building is being paid for through a $188,000 federal grant, The Island Packet of Hilton Head reported. Work is expected to start in October and last six months. The windows were damaged when Hurricane Matthew passed just offshore in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Beaufort officials also hired a building preservation expert to look at the entire former library and provide an estimate for any other worked needed to preserve it. The library in downtown Beaufort is one of 14 in South Carolina and more than 1,600 public libraries across the United States funded by steel industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The old library now houses the Beaufort/Port Royal Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been awarded an $11 million federal grant to develop better material and manufacturing technology to withstand cold weather. South Dakota Mines will partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Cold Regions and Engineering Lab. The research will be done over five years and is aimed at developing better materials and technology to support the Army’s military objectives in cold and remote regions. U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said funding for the project has been his top defense appropriation request for three years, the Rapid City Journal reported. Dr. Jim Rankin, president of South Dakota Mines, said the research is a win-win for the university and for national defense.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:A state senator charged with stealing $600,000 in federal grant money from a health care school she operated has been acquitted on 15 of 20 charges, according to court records. U.S. District Court Judge Sheryl Lipman filed the order Sunday after attorneys for Sen. Katrina Robinson filed a motion Friday seeking acquittal on all charges, Memphis news outlets reported. Robinson, 40, a Memphis Democrat elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2018, was charged in July 2020 with wire fraud, as well as theft and embezzlement involving government programs after the FBI searched the school and her home. She was accused of stealing federal grant money awarded to The Healthcare Institute, which provides training in the health care field, including nursing assistant jobs in geriatric care. The school received more than $2.2 million in federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The federal grant money was earmarked for student scholarships from 2015 through 2019. Robinson’s attorneys argued for an acquittal Friday after federal prosecutors rested their case. They argued that prosecutors didn’t prove allegations that Robinson used the federal grant funds on personal expenses. The trial was expected to continue Tuesday on the five remaining charges, court filings showed..\n\nTexas\n\nSouth Padre Island: A large loggerhead sea turtle rehabilitated at the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital was flown by private plane Sunday to live at a conservation facility in Texas. The 230-pound female turtle took the nearly 5-hour flight from the Middle Keys to South Padre Island, with the help of “Turtles Fly Too,” a nonprofit group that works with general aviation pilots who donate their aircraft, fuel and time to provide emergency transport for endangered species. Matthew, named for one of her rescuers before her sex was determined, suffered injuries to her shell in May 2020 from a boat strike that left her unable to dive and forage for food – a condition termed “bubble butt syndrome” by the hospital’s rehabilitation staff. “She’s being transported to Sea Turtle Inc. in South Padre Island because she’s unable to dive,” said Bette Zirkelbach, the Turtle Hospital’s general manager, who accompanied the reptile during the flight. “That makes her nonreleasable and she will act as an ambassador for her species there at the Texas facility where they see lots of visitors.” The reptile joins other rehabilitated, nonreleasable turtle patients at Sea Turtle Inc., located on the Gulf of Mexico. The organization’s conservation outreach programs are designed to raise public awareness about sea turtles and the threats to their survival. Matthew’s carapace has been fitted with weights, fashioned to adhere to the shell and help the turtle submerge and rest comfortably during her residency at the Texas center.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The St. George Marathon returns Saturday for its 45th edition and the first since 2019 after the 2020 race was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is set to start at its usual spot north of the city along State Route 18 at the base of the Pine Valley Mountains and descending nearly 2,600 feet in elevation back to the finish line downtown. The race starts at 7 a.m. and will force some road closures and detours along SR-18 and a number of streets in and around downtown. “We are so excited to have the marathon back in 2021. It is St. George’s signature event,” said Michelle Graves, race director and the Deputy Director of Arts and Events for the city of St. George. “This might be the best St. George Marathon ever. There has been a vibrant return to racing and we are happy to have a strong field of runners for this year's event.” This year's event will include a mini-marathon starting at 6:15 a.m, with races of 1 mile and 200 meters at Vernon Worthen Park. Children ages 3 to 12 and people with special needs are invited to participate. After the races, a party in the park is set to last until 8 a.m. Organizers expect about 7,000 runners to participate. Many others have signed on to be volunteers. The annual Mayor's Walk is also scheduled for Saturday morning, with Mayor Michele Randall leading a 1-mile walk from the Washington County School District offices at 121 W. Tabernacle Street over to Vernon Worthen. The marathon has been run every year except last year since 1977 and is regularly rated as one of the most scenic races in the country, as well as one of the fastest because of its downhill course.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Registration opened Monday for Vermonters ages 75 and older to get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster. On Wednesday, people 70 and older can start signing up followed by the 65-and-older age group on Friday. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed booster shots for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans six months after receiving their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. On Friday, those ages 18 to 64 with underlying medical conditions or who work in certain occupational settings will become eligible for boosters, the state said. The state is waiting for guidance from the CDC on the type of underlying medical conditions and occupational settings. Booster shots are available where Pfizer vaccines are offered, including at a Health Department clinic, pharmacy or health care provider, state officials said. People must make an appointment to get a shot at a state clinic and are asked to bring their vaccine cards with them. Information can be found on the Vermont Health Department website.\n\nVirginia\n\nLafayette: A small earthquake shook southwestern Virginia on Monday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 2.6 happened about 9:37 a.m. It was centered about 2.5 miles north of Lafayette, and was about 8 miles deep. News outlets reported that people in nearby Salem reported feeling the ground shaking, but there were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Twenty-five media and transparency groups are asking the state Supreme Court to allow the release of the names of the Seattle police officers who attended events in the nation’s caital on Jan. 6. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press and the news organizations filed an amicus brief Friday asking the court to deny an injunction filed by the officers that seeks to block the release of public records that identify the officers. Police officers “are public servants who, when on-duty, wield tremendous power to detain, arrest, jail, and, in extreme circumstances, employ deadly force in connection with their duties,” the groups said. “Without access to officer names, the public has no insight into whether certain officers have been the subject of multiple misconduct investigations or whether police oversight boards are effectively evaluating and responding to repeated misconduct complaints, particularly when such complaints are deemed unsubstantiated.” The officers have argued that they did nothing wrong and revealing their names would violate their privacy. But the media groups said their attendance at a public demonstration that drew thousands of people and news organizations was not a private activity. A message left for Mike Solan, the president of the Seattle Police Officer’s Guild, seeking comment was not immediately returned. Arguments before the Supreme Court are set for Nov. 9.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia internet customers are being asked to take a broadband speed test to improve access in the state. “Data collected from the speed test will be instrumental in making decisions about broadband access in West Virginia moving forward,” state Department of Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael said in a news release. Information from the tests will be used to create a map identifying where investment in broadband is needed most, the agency said. The test is available at broadband.wv.gov. Click the red button that reads “TAKE THE SPEED TEST” at the top of the page and follow the steps. A few additional questions about location and internet service follow the test, and the whole process takes about 5 minutes. The Broadband Enhancement Council is also involved in publicizing the speed test through a campaign using text messages and digital advertising.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Cardinal Raymond Burke, 73, one of Catholic Church’s most outspoken conservatives and a vaccine skeptic who was placed on a ventilator after contracting COVID-19, said he has moved into a house but is still struggling to recover from the disease. Burke posted a letter on his website Saturday saying he left a hospital Sept. 3 and moved into a house near his family. He didn’t say where. Burke said he’s going through in-home rehabilitation, still suffers from fatigue and has difficulty breathing. He didn’t detail what his rehabilitation regimen included but said he is making steady but slow progress. He said a secretary from Rome has moved in with him to help him with his rehabilitation and catch up on his work. “I cannot predict when I will be able to return to my normal activities,” Burke wrote. “Seemingly, it will be several more weeks.” He said God saved him for “some work” he wants him to carry out with the help of the church and asked people to pray for him, the world and the church, all of which are “beset with so much confusion and error to the great and even mortal harm of many souls.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Felicia, a mama grizzly bear whose troubles won the hearts of the Internet, has successfully shepherded her cubs through a perilous summer. Her fans miss seeing the bear family grazing and frolicking along Togwotee Pass. But they hope, for Felicia’s sake, that she will stay out of sight. This spring, record numbers of tourists were clogging the roads around Wyoming’s national parks when Felicia emerged from hibernation with two fuzzy, bumbling, roly-poly cubs, and established herself by the side of the highway. Passersby were mesmerized. Bear jams proliferated. The congestion wasn’t just a nuisance, however. Too many drivers were spotting Felicia and her cubs, swerving to the side of a 55 mph highway and leaving their cars to approach the bears – in violation of posted signs that forbade exactly that, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Three government agencies that watch over Felicia, the highway and the land she inhabited, lacked the resources to continually enforce parking laws or uphold the protections that grizzlies, a threatened species, are afforded under the Endangered Species Act. So rather than attempt to manage the people, officials managed the bear. Rangers typically use pain and noise to train bears to fear undesirable locations. That strategy, known as hazing, separated Felicia from her surviving cub for a month in 2019. Though the two ultimately reunited, the cub didn’t survive the following winter. Hazing, though less risky than relocation, isn’t a perfect solution. It can cause bears to act erratically around roads, increasing the risk of collisions. It can separate mothers from their cubs – sometimes temporarily, like with Felicia in 2019, and sometimes permanently. But it can also work. In Felicia’s case, hazing has been effective. Nearly four months after Felicia – known to rangers as grizzly 863 – fled a barrage of rubber bullets, beanbags and noisemakers, the bear has maintained her distance from roads, vehicles and people, and has kept her cubs by her side.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/23/texas-travis-mullis-execution/75107634007/", "title": "Texas death row inmate Travis Mullis: 'Consumed by shame and ...", "text": "This story includes graphic descriptions of crimes committed against an infant.\n\nA death row inmate set to be executed in Texas this week destroyed the only family he ever knew about 16 years ago.\n\nTravis James Mullis, 38, is set to be executed Tuesday for killing his 3-month-old son, who was molested, stomped to death and abandoned at Galveston’s Seawall, a popular tourist destination just south of Houston, on Jan. 29, 2008.\n\nMullis murdered his son after he described hitting his “breaking point,” failing to soothe the crying child while they were parked along the seawall, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\n“I tried all the little things that would comfort him since he was born, but none of them worked,” Mullis said. “I thought to myself that the only way to stop him from crying was to kill him.”\n\nIf the execution proceeds as scheduled, Mullis will be the fourth person executed in the state this year and the 15th or 16th in the nation, depending on whether he's declared dead before or after Marcellus Williams, another inmate set for execution in Missouri on the same day.\n\nAs Mullis' execution day approaches, USA TODAY is looking back at who the man is, the crime he was convicted of and what led him down a path that ended in the murder of his infant son.\n\nAdoptive mother 'completely overwhelmed' by behavior\n\nTravis “TJ” Mullis was taken in by relatives in Maryland when he was a baby, following his mother’s unexpected death. He grew up in Abingdon, an unincorporated community just outside Baltimore, with his uncle Gary Mills and his wife, Anne.\n\nTJ began to give the couple trouble at the age of 3, exhibiting alarming behaviors like banging his head against furniture, and talking about fire and wanting to burn things down, court documents show.\n\nAnne Mullis decided to put him in therapy, and TJ soon confided in his therapist that his adoptive father had sexually abused him repeatedly from ages 3 to 6, according to court documents.\n\nTJ had a “tough” time adjusting to life without his adoptive father, who was kicked out of the home and served prison time after the sexual abuse came to light. But the “garbage really hit the fan,” Anne Mullis shared with attorneys, when TJ hit puberty.\n\nA one-way ticket to Texas\n\nMullis spent his childhood and teen years in and out of hospitals, receiving intermittent mental health treatment and medication for behavioral issues. He was struggling in school, dealing with traumatic flashbacks and had threatened suicide on a number of occasions, court records say.\n\nThere were also isolated episodes of violent and sometimes sexual aggression inflicted on those closest to him, including his grandmother, a younger cousin and a couple of peers, court records say. He stayed with his adoptive mother until he turned 18, at which point he was told that he either needed to take his medications or get out, according to court documents.\n\n“I was completely overwhelmed and had no idea what to do with him,” Anne Mullis wrote in court documents. “He eventually decided to leave.”\n\nShe bought Mullis a one-way ticket to Texas, where he planned to live with a woman he met online but that was short-lived, court documents say.\n\nMullis lived in and around Houston for a while, crashing with anyone who would take him in. When he moved back in with the woman and her family a year later, he brought his girlfriend, Caren Kohberger, and the couple's then-1-month-old son, Alijah. They all lived together in a trailer in Alvin in metro Houston.\n\nThe young family was broke, hoping to find a solution to their financial woes by February 2008, which was when they were expected to start paying rent.\n\nMullis was ‘consumed by shame and madness’ before murder\n\nMullis and his family had run out of options by late January 2008. He had been applying for jobs, even interviewing for two, but was still out of work.\n\nHe decided to get some air early that Tuesday morning on Jan. 29, inviting his roommate’s 8-year-old daughter to join him on his quest for cigarettes and Snickers bars from a gas station. On their way back, they stopped by the girl’s school and that's when Mullis tried to get her to pull down her pants before driving back to the trailer after she started to cry, according to court records.\n\nMullis pulled his girlfriend aside when they got back to tell her what he had done. Mullis and Kohberger bickered for hours about what they were going to do, both scared that they would be thrown out of the house and that Mullis would mentally relapse and act out on his impulses again.\n\nMullis came up with an excuse to get away, promising Kohberger he would return after running a quick errand. Kohberger insisted Mullis take baby Alijah with him − that way she knew he was going to come back, court documents show.\n\nMullis drove south toward Galveston with Alijah, who was sound asleep in the car seat. But when Alijah was startled awake, he began to cry. Mullis said he tried to console the baby, but Alijah wouldn’t stop crying. Mullis then molested and choked the infant before he pulled Alijah out of the car, put him on the ground and stomped on his head, court records say.\n\nAs Mullis' attorneys said in court documents, Mullis was \"consumed by shame and madness\" moments before he committed the murder.\n\nAfterward, Mullis flung the car seat and Alijah's body toward the other side of the seawall to get rid of all the evidence. He then fled the state but soon after he turned himself in, offering a full confession to Philadelphia police four days later. Mullis was extradited back to Texas, convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.\n\nJudge: Mullis has 'enjoyed all the process he is due'\n\nWith help from court-appointed counsel, Mullis decided to forgo appeals following his death sentence but later changed his mind and tried to file a state court appeal. He didn't file the appeal in time, which ended his prospects in state court.\n\nMullis revived his claims in federal district court with new counsel in July 2013, with his attorneys arguing that his trial was \"beset by constitutional errors\" and that state courts allowed him to waive appeals \"despite his severe mental illness, and as a result of ineffective lawyering and court error.”\n\nMullis' current attorneys argued that his previous lawyers failed to rebut false evidence, properly investigate and present compelling evidence, and ultimately protect his rights. A federal court eventually dismissed Mullis' request to throw out his death sentence and sided with the state. An appeals court affirmed the dismissal.\n\nU.S. District Judge George Hanks described Mullis as “a disturbed individual whose mental illness has permeated his life.”\n\n“Questions about mental illness have colored this whole case − from the commission of the crime, to the various waivers, to federal review,” according to Hanks. “As concerns about Mullis’ mental health have come up at each stage, state counsel and various courts have acted with competence and zeal to assure that Mullis has enjoyed all the process he is due.”\n\nMullis is set to be executed at the Huntsville Unit north of Houston on Tuesday, Sept. 24.\n\nMullis is one of 5 men being executed in less than a week\n\nMullis is one of five men expected to be executed in the U.S. in a six-day period.

A flurry of last-minute legal efforts to stop it followed recent problems with executions in several states, as the stock of lethal-injection drugs and willing suppliers has dried up.\n\nSells, 49, was sentenced to death for the 1999 stabbing of a 13-year-old girl. He claimed to have killed up to 70 people across the country.\n\nHe won his petition for a stay of execution Wednesday in federal district court, which ruled that the state must inform lawyers how they planned to kill him and another death row inmate scheduled for execution next week.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals immediately overturned the ruling in Sells' case and said the drug supplier's name should remain secret to protect against threats of violence.\n\nSells' Supreme Court petition listed as defendants a variety of state officials and \"unknown executioners.\" It demanded to know the source of the pentobarbital the state planned to use in his execution, how it was prepared and who had tested it, citing the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nSells \"has a constitutional interest — and consequent due process rights — in not being executed in a torturous manner,\" his attorneys told the high court just hours before his execution.\n\nAfter the high court turned down Sells' request, attorneys Maurie Levin and Jonathan Ross said: \"Without transparency about lethal injections, particularly the source and purity of drugs to be used, it is impossible to ensure that executions are humane and constitutional.\"\n\nThe state uses a compounding pharmacy to get its drugs, which have become scarce coast to coast as supplies from Europe have dried up and amid concerns about legal liability. Such pharmacies are subject to less government regulation. The drugs they dispense, used in combination with others, have caused problems in some recent executions.\n\nThe state defended its death penalty policy in its briefs in Sells' case, arguing that \"there is no pharmacy, no drug, and no assurance of quality that would be satisfactory to him.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected a similar request last month from a death row inmate in Missouri who was subsequently executed. It has pending petitions from death row prisoners in Louisiana and Missouri, either of which could become a test case next fall on the standards states use to ensure condemned prisoners aren't denied their constitutional rights during execution.\n\nTexas executes the most prisoners in the country; Sells was its fifth lethal-injection execution this year. Some states that use capital punishment have delayed executions, and some courts have blocked them, because of the difficulty in finding drugs and suppliers.\n\nLast month, judges in Oklahoma and Louisiana ruled that those states could not hide the identities of their suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nThe struggle to find lethal-injection drugs comes as executions are on the decline. While 32 states still have capital punishment on their books, the number of executions has dropped from 98 in 1999 to 39 last year.\n\nIn recent years, Connecticut Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York have abolished the death sentence. Governors in Colorado, Oregon and Washington have suspended the punishment. Courts have halted executions in Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee over lethal-injection issues.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2021/11/01/robert-durst-murder-case-timeline-history/6233327001/", "title": "Robert Durst timeline details history of criminal cases", "text": "Robert Durst was the cross-dressing scion of a billion-dollar Manhattan real estate empire, who left the business when passed over by a younger brother as their father's successor.\n\nFor nearly four decades he was suspected in the disappearance of his wife Kathie from their cottage in South Salem.\n\nDurst was indicted in her killing by a Westchester grand jury on Nov. 1, 2021.

The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/14/malcolm-country-benefit-show-rising-tide-news-around-states/50734257/", "title": "Malcolm X, country benefit show: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge that it could soon be ready to use a new, untried execution method called nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/02/failing-register-draft-women-court-consequences-men/3205425002/", "title": "Failing to register for draft has serious, long-term consequences", "text": "Men who don't register for the draft by age 26 often have problems later in life with federal and state benefits\n\nMore than 1 million men have requested a formal confirmation of their draft status since 1993\n\nThe most common consequences for failing to register are a loss of student aid, citizenship, and federal employment\n\nFor 39 years, it's been a rite of passage for American men. Within 30 days of his 18th birthday, every male citizen and legal resident is required to register for Selective Service, either by filling out a postcard-size form or going online.\n\nWhat's less well known is what happens on a man's 26th birthday.\n\nMen who fail to register for the draft by then can no longer do so – forever closing the door to government benefits like student aid, a government job or even U.S. citizenship.\n\nMen under 26 can get those benefits by taking advantage of what has effectively become an eight-year grace period, signing up for Selective Service on the spot.\n\nAfter that, an appeal can be costly and time-consuming. Selective Service statistics suggest that more than 1 million men have been denied some government benefit because they weren't registered for the draft.\n\nWith the current male-only draft requirement declared unconstitutional, Congress will have to decide whether to eliminate Selective Service registration or expand it to women.\n\nUnable to decide that question for decades, Congress created the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service in 2016. It's studying the future of the draft with a report due next year.\n\nAmong the issues it's examining: Should draft registration be mandatory? If so, what's fairest way to enforce it? Should the same consequences that have followed men for nearly four decades also apply to women?\n\n\"We're taking a look at all of these questions,\" says Vice Chairwoman Debra Wada, a former assistant secretary of the Army. \"And that means looking at whether the current system is both fair and equitable – but also transparent.\"\n\nMen who have been caught in the over-26 trap say the system is anything but.\n\nSince 1993, more than 1 million American men have requested a formal copy of their draft status from the Selective Service System, according to data obtained by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Those status-information letters are the first step in trying to appeal the denial of benefits, and are the best indication of how many men have been impacted by legal consequences of failing to register.\n\nOn paper, it's a crime to \"knowingly fail or neglect or refuse\" to register for the draft. The penalty is up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nLast year, Selective Service referred 112,051 names and addresses of suspected violators to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.\n\nStill, only 20 men have been criminally charged with refusing to register for the draft since President Jimmy Carter reinstated it in 1980 in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Only 14 were convicted. The last indictment, in 1986, was dismissed before it went to trial.\n\nSo now the system relies largely on voluntary compliance, a patchwork of state laws, and the risk of losing federal benefits.\n\nCongress passed two provisions to tighten enforcement in the 1980s. The Solomon amendment in 1982 made Selective Service registration a requirement for federal student aid. The Thurmond Amendment in 1985 did the same for federal employment.\n\nFederal student aid is the most common problem for men who haven't registered for the draft, according Selective Service data obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nForty states and the District of Columbia link Selective Service to a driver's license. But some of those allow men to opt out of registration, and about a quarter of Americans in their early 20s don't have a driver's license.\n\nThirty-one states have legislation mirroring federal laws on student aid and employment, applying those bans to state-funded student aid programs and state employment.\n\nSome states go even further:\n\n► In eight states, men are not allowed men to register at a state college or university – even without financial aid – if they aren't registered for Selective Service. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Tennessee.\n\n► In Ohio, men who live in the state but don't register for Selective Service must pay out-of-state tuition rates.\n\n► In Alaska, men who fail to register for the draft can't receive an annual dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which gave Alaska residents $1,600 from state oil revenue in 2018.\n\nAs a result, registration rates vary from 100 percent in New Hampshire to 63 percent in North Dakota – and just 51 percent in the District of Columbia, according to Selective Service data.\n\n\"It's very uneven across the country,\" said Shawn Skelly, a former Navy commander and member of the 11-member commission studying the draft.\n\n\"How people register is predominately passively. Most men who register, register though secondary means when they apply for student aid or get a driver's license. There isn't a real deliberate education of people about the law.\"\n\nLike the Vietnam War draft that helped fuel the social upheaval of the 1960s and '70s, today's draft registration requirement puts a disproportionate burden on lower-class Americans. They're more likely to put off college until later in life – and to need student aid when they do go to school.\n\nIn comments to the national service commission, critics of the policy called that policy \"exceptionally cruel.\"\n\n'It was an honest mistake'\n\nDepending on how you look at it, Brandon Prudhomme either had a very good or very bad reason for failing to register for the draft: He was in prison for most of the time between the ages of 18 and 25.\n\nHis arrest record includes assault, drug possession and resisting arrest.\n\n\"It was an honest mistake,\" he said. \"I was on my own since I was 14 years old. I got involved in gang-type stuff.\"\n\nBut now he's 39 and trying to turn his life around. While living in a homeless shelter, he started his own landscaping company \"with two rakes and four lawn bags,\" he said.\n\nHe'd like to go back to school for business. But since Prudhomme didn't register for Selective Service, he can't get student loans. \"The financial aid people called me and said, 'Sir, do yo know anything about Selective Service?' I said no. They said my application had been red-flagged,\" he said.\n\n\"If it was mandatory, how was there not the opportunity for me to sign those papers?\" Prudhomme asked. \"He said that was my responsibility.\"\n\nThe law has also snagged federal information technology workers, Forest Service firefighters, Veterans Administration doctors and even federal contractors.\n\nRichard Henry, a contractor for the Internal Revenue Service, lost his access to IRS facilities because he failed to register for Selective Service. They found out because Henry told them, repeatedly, beginning in 2001. But in 2011, the IRS changed the rules to make Selective Service a requirement. He was over 26, so he couldn't register.\n\nSo he sued, and lost in 2017.\n\n\"If they're going to enforce this law, you should know about the law and you should know about the consequences,\" said Henry's lawyer, Rachel L.T. Rodriguez. \"The problem here is, you don't know the consequences that follow you forever like this.\"\n\nBut officials say that for draft registration to work, the law has to have teeth.\n\n\"If there were no penalties for failing to register, the rates would plummet, and fairness and equity would go out the window,\" said Matthew Tittman, a spokesman for the Selective Service System, a civilian agency that administers draft registration.\n\nMen who are over 26 and denied benefits can appeal the decision if they can prove that their failure to register was not \"knowing and willful.\"\n\nIt's unclear how many men succeed. The Office of Personnel Management says it got 160 requests for waivers in the last fiscal year. The Department of Education would not release data or discuss its process on the record.\n\nAnd proving that someone didn't intentionally evade the draft can be costly and time consuming, taking as long as 18 months to decide.\n\nMarc J. Smith, a Rockville, Maryland, federal employment lawyer who handles such cases, says the process can cost $3,500 to $4,000 in legal fees.\n\nAn appeal can involve researching when and where the Selective Service sent reminder letters, and gathering sworn statements from parents, childhood friends and school officials.\n\nThe cases rarely make it to court. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the courts didn't have jurisdiction over federal employment cases because there was an administrative process to handle those claims.\n\nEven if Congress eliminates the draft, Smith said, it's unclear whether those old penalties will go away.\n\n\"People will still have this issue,\" he said. \"And I guess that means a much larger pool of potential clients for me.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/17/carbon-storage-commissioner-comeback-hand-recounts-news-around-states/50609615/", "title": "Carbon storage, commissioner comeback: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A project that’s been planned for more than a decade is nearing fruition, thanks to a $20 million federal grant. The Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor has been on hold for years because of a lack of funding, city officials said. Known unofficially as the skybridge, the PARC project will safely connect the downtown, Mill Creek and Lower Mill communities through greenways and a suspended pedestrian bridge, al.com reports. Those three areas are now separated by two major state and federal roads. The funding comes from the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. “We appreciate our partnership with the federal government and this grant, which will help us take Huntsville to the next level,” Mayor Tommy Battle said. Two other Alabama projects also received funding through similar grants. The town of Cordova received $5.2 million to improve deteriorating roadways, and the Northwest Alabama Council of Local Governments received $2 million for the Shoals Area Railroad Overpass in Colbert County. Shane Davis, Huntsville’s director of Urban & Economic Development, said the city’s skybridge project has been a goal since 2006.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Baby boomers who retired early as the COVID-19 pandemic set in are a key factor behind the state’s labor shortage, Alaska Public Media reports. State economist Dan Robinson told the news outlet that many older workers felt they could afford to take the leap early, while many others who left the labor market in recent years were in their 30s and stymied by a lack of child care. He told APM that while the pandemic was a factor, employers will just have to adjust to a new reality, as a lack of stable funding for government services means Alaska’s population loss trend is unlikely to abate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Proponents of three voter initiatives who each turned in hundreds of thousands of signatures last month to qualify them for the November ballot are trying to beat back legal challenges that could prevent them from going before voters. Two of the measures – one requiring disclosure of who is funding political campaigns and another rolling back or blocking efforts by Republicans to tighten voting rules – are being challenged by pro-business groups. They alleged that paid petition circulators made errors or omitted required information on their registrations with the secretary of state or petitions. The third measure, backed by a California-based employee union, would protect residents from predatory bill collection and raise the amount of assets shielded from bill collectors. It faces a similar challenge from a newly formed group funded by Arizona debt collection agencies, who say the description voters saw when they asked to sign was illegally misleading. Lawyers for challengers and the initiative proponents have spent the past two weeks in court, and three different Phoenix judges will decide who is correct. Whichever sides lose are are expected to appeal directly to the state Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the state’s use of the sedative midazolam in its lethal injections. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court judge’s ruling upholding Arkansas’ execution process. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker ruled in 2020 that the state’s use of midazolam in injections is constitutional and dismissed claims that less painful methods of execution are available. “With no scientific consensus and a paucity of reliable scientific evidence concerning the effect of large doses of midazolam on humans, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the prisoners failed to demonstrate that the Arkansas execution protocol is sure or very likely to cause severe pain,” the appeals panel said in its ruling. The ruling comes more than five years since Arkansas raced to execute eight inmates over 11 days before its batch of midazolam expired. The state ultimately put four men to death after courts halted the other four executions. It hasn’t executed any inmates since 2017 and has none scheduled. “It is past time that justice be carried out in these cases of defendants killing innocent people, and the Eighth Circuit’s decision reaffirms that Arkansas’ execution protocol is constitutional,” Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente psychologists, therapists, social workers and other mental health workers in Northern California began an open-ended strike Monday over staffing shortages that their union said have led patients to wait for months to get help. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents the workers, is negotiating a new contract with the Oakland-based health giant. It said the strike is to demand Kaiser hire more mental health workers to ease the burden put on the current staff. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement it has hired hundreds of new mental health workers, including 200 since January 2021, and pointed out the shortage in mental health care professionals is happening nationwide. It said that what’s at issue is the union’s demand to increase the time therapists spend on tasks other than seeing patients. The union is demanding 9 hours be allotted for administrative work, which would leave only 31 hours to see patients per week, the company said. It said it proposed increasing the time for administrative tasks from 6 to 7.2 hours, leaving 32.8 hours to see patients. Jeffrey Chen-Harding, a clinical social worker with Kaiser who was picketing Monday in San Francisco, said that what Kaiser calls an administrative task is actually important work directly related to patient care.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man had a rude awaking early Saturday morning when a roughly 400-pound bear flipped the lever doorknob to his home and rummaged through some dog food, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said Monday. The homeowner, Ken Mauldin, grabbed a gun and shot the bear multiple times until it collapsed and died just after 2 a.m., said Rachael Gonzalez, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Nobody was injured, she said. Officers removed the animal from the house, located in the ski resort town of Steamboat Springs. The couple had a legal right to shoot the bear if they felt threatened, Gonzalez said. Colorado has roughly 12,000 bears, and break-ins aren’t uncommon in Rocky Mountain towns. People shooting and killing bears in self-defense, however, is rare, Gonzalez said. This particular male bear was not tagged, and the department does not know if it was involved in other break-ins, she said. “Steamboat, that area, they’ve been dealing with bears getting into homes all summer long,” Gonzalez said. “It’s not impossible that this bear learned the behavior from another bear.” Residents of Steamboat Springs are warned by the agency to lock doors and windows, secure their trash and recycling in bear-proof bins, and even take down bird feeders to prevent these kind of confrontations.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday cleared the way for a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut to proceed against Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The case was filed by relatives of some victims of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Jones has falsely claimed that the nation’s deadliest school shooting – which killed 20 students and six educators – was a hoax. Jones’ lawyer had sought to transfer the case to a federal bankruptcy court, rather than continue the case in Connecticut state court. That move brought the first day of jury selection to a sudden halt earlier this month. However, Monday’s ruling by Judge Julie Manning essentially allows the plaintiffs to continue the defamation lawsuit against just Jones as an individual, without Free Speech Systems, a company owned by Jones and a defendant in the Connecticut case. “The plaintiffs’ rights to have that process continue in the Connecticut Superior Court should not be disturbed,” Manning wrote in the decision, adding that the plaintiffs’ claims for damages were ready for trial. A Texas jury this month ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook and another $4.1 million for the suffering he put them through by claiming for years that the shooting was a hoax.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A family is hoping for change after a 37-year-old man with an intellectual disability had his arm broken while he was taken into police custody earlier this year in an encounter advocates say could have gone differently if crisis intervention tactics were used. The man, who was violating a court order when he stood across the street from his aunt’s house in the New Castle area and is now facing charges, called police himself to report an argument with his aunt. The encounter ended with him being leg-swiped by an officer, which landed him on the ground with a broken arm that required surgery. New Castle County Police investigated the use of force officers exhibited that night and found that officer conduct was appropriate. But the encounter is one from which family and advocates say police can and should learn, as people with disabilities are more likely to be victims of police brutality. “Disability-related behaviors can be misunderstood by law enforcement officers who are trained to gain control and compliance on a scene but typically not trained to identify a disability or know how to interact or communicate with persons with disabilities,” said Carlean Ponder, director of disability rights and housing policy at The Arc, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Homeland Security Department’s inspector general has refused congressional requests for documents and staff testimony about the erasure of Secret Service communication related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, angering top Democrats who accuse him of unlawfully obstructing their investigation. In an Aug. 8 letter disclosed Tuesday, Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the leaders of the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees that his office will not comply with their requests for internal documents and sit-down interviews due to the ongoing criminal investigation into deleted Secret Service text messages. In response, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter Tuesday demanding Cuffari turn over documents and make his staff available to lawmakers or risk facing a potential congressional subpoena “Your obstruction of the Committees’ investigations is unacceptable, and your justifications for this noncompliance appear to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Congress’s authority and your duties as an Inspector General,” Maloney and Thompson wrote in the letter. “If you continue to refuse to comply with our requests, we will have no choice but to consider alternate measures to ensure your compliance,” they wrote.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Tracks used by the nation’s deadliest railroad will see added fencing to keep pedestrians away and safety improvements at crossings under a $25 million federal grant announced Monday. Brightline and government officials announced the grant as the privately owned passenger line continues to be plagued by deaths along its tracks between Miami and West Palm Beach. In the past two weeks, Brightline trains have killed three people – and 68 since the service began its first runs five years ago. That’s about one death for every 33,000 miles its trains travel, the worst fatality rate among the nation’s more than 800 railroads, according to an ongoing Associated Press analysis of Federal Railroad Administration data. The grant, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program, will cover safety features, including 33 miles of fencing at locations of frequent trespassing along with extensive crossing improvements at all 333 crossings along the corridor, which will eventually stretch from Miami to Orlando, Brightline President Patrick Goddard said. The company will also install an additional 150 warning signs and 170 more suicide crisis hotline signs “to better reach those who might be struggling with suicide,” Goddard said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he will spend up to $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 aid on payments of $350 apiece to more than 3 million Georgians who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps or cash welfare assistance. The payments will start in September, said Katie Byrd, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move comes atop Kemp’s proposals last week to spend $2 billion in state surplus, split between property tax rebates and a second round of income tax rebates, if voters choose him for a second term in November over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Those separate plans would require legislative approval next year. Monday’s announcement will put money in the hands of less affluent Georgians in the months before the nationally watched election in a narrowly contested swing state. Those are voters to whom Abrams has been tailoring her economic platform. She also backs another round of income tax rebates, like those Kemp already pushed though, but has been arguing that Georgia also needs to do more to invest in long-term expansions of health, education and small-business assistance to try to create a less unequal economy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new monk seal on Oahu’s North Shore has marine officials asking the public to give the mother and pup plenty of room, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The baby monk seal is the 14th birthed by mother Right Spot and her first on Oahu, having typically given birth on the island of Molokai, where she was born.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge says the Legislature can intervene in the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit targeting the state’s total abortion ban – but only to present evidence about emergency abortions performed in Medicaid-funded emergency rooms. In the written ruling handed down Saturday, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the Legislature’s interests are already well-represented by the Idaho Attorney General’s office and Gov. Brad Little, so there’s no legitimate reason to add another party to the lawsuit. The Justice Department sued Idaho last week over the state’s strict abortion ban, saying it would force doctors to violate the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law that requires anyone coming to a medical facility for emergency treatment to be stabilized and treated. Allowing a state legislature the right to intervene in every federal case without first proving a distinct need would allow a state to “turn into a nine-headed Hydra whenever it chooses,” Winmill said. The abortion ban was enacted in 2020 and set up as a “trigger law,” set to take effect Aug. 25 now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions, and anyone who performs, attempts or assists with abortions can face two to five years in prison and lose their health care license. Physicians who perform abortions to save a patient’s life or in cases of rape or incest can use that information as a legal defense during the criminal trial.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A suburban Chicago police officer who fatally shot a hatchet-wielding man during a June traffic stop was justified in the deadly shooting, a prosecutor has determined. DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said Monday that Naperville police Officer Frank Tonkovich “reasonably believed” Edward Samaan, 28, of Naperville, was trying to kill either him or a driver Tonkovich had pulled over separately. Berlin said in a news release that Tonkovich’s actions were not just reasonable “but necessary in order to prevent great bodily harm or death to himself or the motorist he had stopped,” The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reports. The officer had pulled over a car June 3 and was standing at that driver’s window when Samaan pulled his vehicle up nearby, exited it and charged Tonkovich with a hatchet in his hand, Berlin said. Tonkovich then shot at Samaan six times, hitting him five times. Samaan was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officer, a 22-year-veteran of the Naperville Police Department, was not injured.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Preliminary autopsy results released Monday for the three victims of a house explosion in a southern Indiana neighborhood show they died of blunt force trauma and compression asphyxia. A married couple who lived at the center of the Wednesday explosion in Evansville, 43-year-old Charles Hite and 37-year-old Martina Hite, both died of blunt force trauma to their chests, and 29-year-old neighbor Jessica Teague died of compression asphyxia, the Vanderburgh County Coroner’s Office said in a news release. Final autopsy reports and toxicology are pending, Chief Deputy Coroner David Anson said in the news release. The explosion injured a fourth person and damaged 39 homes, leaving 11 uninhabitable, authorities have said. A statement Monday by the Evansville Fire Department said the investigation is still in its early stages and likely will be lengthy. Suzanne Dabkowski, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said last week that the agency can’t speak to any possible causes of the explosion. Dabkowski said the ATF has explosive specialists and firearms investigators on site helping with the investigation. Evansville authorities have declined to speculate whether natural gas or another issue is responsible for the explosion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The developer of a proposed $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline must release the names of landowners who could be affected along its roughly 680-mile route, a district judge ruled. Summit Carbon Solutions, an Ames company that has proposed building a pipeline to transport liquefied carbon dioxide, failed to win a permanent injunction to keep secret the names of thousands of landowners it said could be in the pipeline’s path. Under state law, Summit was required to hold public meetings for landowners potentially affected by the pipeline project, and the company compiled a list with more than 10,000 names along the route. After the Iowa Utilities Board asked Summit to submit the names, the company asked state regulators to keep the list confidential. Summit also filed a petition with the court to keep the names secret. The Sierra Club of Iowa asked regulators to release the names under state’s open records law, a move state Consumer Advocate Jennifer Easler also supported. In November, the Iowa Utilities Board decided it would keep secret most of the names, saying property owners’ right to privacy outweighed the public’s interest. On Friday, Polk County District Judge David Nelmark said Summit had failed to show landowner information should be excluded from state public records law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to do a partial hand recount that won’t change the outcome of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights after abortion opponents charged almost $120,000 to credit cards Monday to cover the cost. The Kansas secretary of state’s office said the recount will occur in nine of the state’s 105 counties that account for more than half of the votes cast on the Aug. 2 abortion ballot question, including four of the state’s five most populous counties. Voters who want to keep the abortion rights allowed under the Kansas Constitution prevailed in eight of the nine counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby in far western Kansas, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita who also promotes election conspiracies, pledged to help pay for the recount. Gietzen used a credit card to pay for all but $1,500 of the costs, which Leavitt will cover. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Leavitt has an online fundraising effort that had received more than $41,000 in donations as of Monday evening.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Experts who are visiting disaster centers can help people whose heirlooms and keepsakes were damaged in recent flooding. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force experts may be able to help save photos, artwork, quilts, important documents and other items, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The experts are visiting Clay County Community Center this week Friday through Sunday, Knott County Sportsplex Tuesday through Sunday, and Hazard Community College First Federal Center Wednesday through Sunday. FEMA said the experts will discuss how to handle, dry and clean the items, and they can provide information about personal safety during the restoration process. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force is co-sponsored by FEMA and the Smithsonian Institution. The task force was created to protect cultural heritage from damage from natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Law enforcement officers have ended a three-day peaceful protest by jail inmates who demanded improvements to living conditions, including quicker attention to requests for medical care. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson issued a statement saying her deputies and state Department of Public Safety and Corrections officers entered a pod inside the Orleans Justice Center on Sunday night after inmates activated the sprinkler system and began to flood the area, WDSU-TV reports. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported inmates had barricaded a pod and refused food, water and medication. Hutson said deputies repeatedly offered to bring food and medication, and inmates refused to accept it. Inmates produced a list of desired changes that Hutson released Sunday. It included demands for more recreation time, a new washer and dryer, a second television, and the lifting of restrictions on how many books and photos inmates may receive each month. They also demanded proper medication and said they wanted sick calls to be treated seriously. An altercation at the jail in June resulted in the death of an inmate, and three stabbings recently occurred in the pod where the protest happened.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators who want to enforce new vessel speed rules to help protect rare whales can expect some pushback from ship operators. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the new proposed rules, which are designed to protect the last remaining North Atlantic right whales, last month. The rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast and require more vessels to comply with the rules. The agency’s National Marine Fisheries Service is holding a series of informational meetings on the new rules. Some shipping and maritime groups said they have concerns the rules could make their jobs more difficult or less safe. The American Pilots’ Association is concerned the new rules would make operations more hazardous for pilot boats, said Clayton Diamond, executive director of the group. Pilot boats transport maritime pilots to and from larger ships, often in bad weather and at carefully calculated speeds, Diamond said. “We think that the NOAA/NMFS proposal to apply the speed restriction to pilot boats is unwise and unsafe,” Diamond said, adding that the group “strongly” supports protecting marine mammals. The agency isn’t commenting on industry concerns during the rulemaking process, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Maryland State Board of Elections voted Monday to file an emergency petition in court that seeks an earlier count of mail-in ballots for the general election in November. The board voted 4-0 to seek a legal remedy in hopes of speeding up the vote count for mail-in ballots, which have become much more popular with voters in the state. In a statement after the vote, the board said that the continued expansion of mail-in balloting and the inability of the local boards of elections to count mail-in ballots before Election Day could have significant implications. “It could leave local, statewide, and even federal contests without certified results until late December 2022 or early January 2023,” the board said. “Maryland is currently the only state in the union that forbids any kind of processing of mail-in ballots until after Election Day.” Currently, mail-in ballots can’t be counted until two days after Election Day. That caused delays in determining winners in the state’s primary last month. The state elections board certified the primary election Monday. Maryland’s primary was delayed by three weeks due to legal challenges involving congressional and legislative redistricting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michael Cox, a Boston police veteran who was brutally beaten by fellow officers while chasing a suspect and fought against efforts to cover up his assault, was sworn in Monday as commissioner of the police department. After taking the oath during a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, Cox thanked his family and friends who supported him through the incident that he said changed his life forever but does not define him. “I’ve worked to change policing since that incident occurred, and I will continue to do all I can to make sure that no Black or brown person or any individual, no matter their gender identity or race, is the victim of any kind of unconstitutional policing,” said Cox, who is Black. Mayor Michelle Wu called Cox a leader that Boston “deserves.” “I’m incredibly proud, grateful and inspired in the future for this city with Commissioner Michael Cox at the helm of the Boston Police Department,” she said. The Boston native most recently served as police chief in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Before taking that job in 2019, Cox served three decades in the Boston Police Department, where he took on the so-called blue wall of silence after he was attacked by colleagues who mistook him for a fleeing suspect whom he was trying to grab as he scaled a fence.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint Township: A name change for Flint Township will not appear on the fall ballot. Township trustees voted 4-2 Monday against placing the question on the ballot. The result would not have been binding, but there had been interest in getting the public’s opinion about a change to Oak Hills Township, MLive.com reports. Supporters of a name change say “Flint” carries baggage. The city is nearby. “In my business world, I have a really hard time selling Flint Township to outside folks,” said Winfield Cooper, a real estate broker. “I have to explain to them it’s not the city of Flint. I have to explain to them it’s not lead-contaminated water.” Flint’s water was contaminated in 2014-15 because state regulators didn’t require that water from the Flint River be treated to reduce corrosion. Changing the township name would cost at least $72,000 to change uniforms, vehicles and buildings at the fire and police departments. “It does nothing to change the township other than to spend money,” said resident Roger Powell, who opposed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Corrections has dropped its order that 18 prisoners who were released from prison to protect their health during the coronavirus pandemic report back to prison. The state had ordered the 18 to return to prison by Monday. But a Ramsey County judge has granted a temporary restraining order, saying reincarcerating the individuals could still be detrimental to their health. Assistant Attorney General Corinne Wright on Friday asked Judge Mark Ireland to cancel further hearings on the corrections order and said the state instead will make individual determinations for the 18 people remaining on conditional medical release, according to an email shared by American Civil Liberties Union Minnesota attorney Daniel Shulman, who sued on behalf of the inmates. “I applaud them for taking this step, and I hope that they will let these people remain on (medical release) where they should be,” Shulman told the Star Tribune. The 18 former prisoners were among the 158 people granted conditional medical release as COVID-19 swept through the prison population in Minnesota. Nearly 2,300 prisoners had applied for release.\n\nMississippi\n\nFlowood: For the second time in less than a month, an innocent bystander was killed during a police chase involving the same department. One person was killed Sunday during a police chase that began in Pearl. The chase ended when the vehicle that was being pursued crashed into a motorcycle, killing the driver. Public information officer Greg Flynn said a Pearl police officer attempted to make a traffic stop when a silver sedan took off. The officer pursued the vehicle into the neighboring city of Flowood, where police there joined the chase until it ended after the fleeing vehicle struck a motorcycle. Flynn said police later discovered the man was driving with a suspended license and had felony convictions at the federal and state levels. He is being charged with felony fleeing resulting in death. Pearl police, Flowood police, the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office and the Flowood Fire Department responded to the scene. Three weeks ago, another vehicle being pursued by Pearl police crashed into a U.S. Postal Service truck in Jackson, killing mail carrier Brad Pennington, 32. That chase began when police attempted to pull over a man for speeding. The man allegedly failed to pull over, and police chased him into Jackson until he crashed his Toyota Camry into Pennington’s mail truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nWyatt: A gas explosion Monday at a southeast Missouri home killed one person and injured nine others, authorities said. The explosion happened about 7 a.m. in Wyatt, a town of about 280 people that’s about 130 miles south of St. Louis, said Capt. Barry Morgan with the Mississippi County Sheriff’s Office. He said authorities were trying to determine whether a water heater or stove was to blame. He identified the person killed only as a man in his mid-20s. Nine other people – the youngest just 6 months old – had serious or critical burn injuries. Several were flown to hospitals in St. Louis and Memphis, Tennessee. “That is a ton of people in a house,” Morgan said. “So that’s what we’re trying to determine, why there were so many people in there, because when I arrived on scene, it was just there was victims lying everywhere, badly burned.” The garage of a neighboring home also caught fire, but no one inside that structure was hurt, Morgan said. The State Fire Marshal and a state propane commission were investigating.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans who must travel long distances to election offices and cope with unreliable and infrequent mail delivery are further disenfranchised under election laws approved last year, a lawyer said Monday during opening statements in a trial challenging the laws’ constitutionality. Jacqueline De León, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, said she would present evidence that the laws ending Election Day voter registration in Montana and banning the paid collection of voted ballots put unreasonable barriers on Native Americans who already face other economic and logistical obstacles. The new laws were passed by the Legislature in 2021, and a similar ballot collection law was declared unconstitutional by two state judges in 2020. “We should not have to bring this case again. But we will certainly prove, once again, that Native Americans are disproportionately and unfairly impacted” by the two bills, De León said. The trial that began Monday in Billings also challenges a law that requires additional proof of residency besides student IDs for college students to register and vote. The trial before District Court Judge Michael Moses is scheduled to last 10 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state audit says the former head of the nonprofit History Nebraska organization diverted COVID-19 relief money to a private foundation, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek’s report suggested potential criminal liability for former History Nebraska Executive Director Trevor Jones over the 2020 transfer of two pandemic aid checks representing more than $270,000 to the History Nebraska Foundation, a then-new group that rivaled History Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As officials in some rural parts of the state vow to bypass voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots this November, the Nevada secretary of state’s office is proposing statewide rules that would specify how to do it, including requiring bipartisan vote counters, creating room for observation and instructing how many ballots to count at a time. On Friday, four voting rights groups came out against the proposal, calling it an “admirable attempt to ensure higher standards” for counting votes by hand but urging the secretary of state to prohibit the practice outright, noting that the push for hand-counting stems from “unfounded speculation” about voting machines. “The regulations are not enough to address the underlying accuracy issues and remediate the legal deficiencies of hand count processes,” the groups Brennan Center, All Voting is Local, ACLU Nevada and Silver State Voices said in a statement Friday. Both voting rights groups and hand-counting proponents spoke at an online hearing Friday, the first meeting convened to discuss the regulations. Voting rights groups lobbied to prohibit hand counts, while voting machine skeptics, a majority of the speakers, said the proposed regulations were a power grab meant to sabotage hand-counting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: As COAST enters its 40th year, the regional bus transportation service is preparing to build a new operations, maintenance and administrative facility, funded in large part by $7.7 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas were among those legislators instrumental in getting the $7.7 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to improve public transportation in the area. “COAST has provided reliable public transportation throughout the Seacoast region for more than 40 years,” Shaheen said. “Its current Dover facility is too small and outdated to achieve its full potential, which is why I helped secure this $7.7 million grant to construct a new facility. This improved facility will advance the quality and sustainability of public transit in the region, which will help drive local economic growth.” Hassan said the grant will “ensure that Granite Staters can get where they need to go safely and efficiently,” while Pappas noted “this grant will help COAST achieve its mission of providing affordable and accessible public transportation.” COAST said the federal funding will greatly enhance its ability to meet the Seacoast’s public transportation needs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With three state Supreme Court seats vacant, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner announced that a trio of appellate court judges would be temporarily promoted to fill the gaps. The order, issued Monday, comes amid a “crisis” of judicial vacancies statewide, causing massive backlogs for cases such as divorces and estate settlements. That shortage includes the New Jersey Supreme Court, which hasn’t had as many vacancies as it does now in recent memory – an “outrageous” scenario, one lawyer said. “Assigning one appellate judge is not uncommon, but three may be unprecedented,” said Carl Golden, who was director of communications for the judiciary from 1990 to 1993 under then-Chief Justice Robert Wilentz. Rabner’s order named Judges Clarkson Fisher Jr., Jack Sabatino and Douglas Fasciale to the state’s highest court. These judges, “who are senior in service,” Rabner said, will “participate in new matters presented for the court’s consideration.” Jeralyn Lawrence, president of the state’s bar association, said these jurists are the “best of the best,” but this is “not what the constitution envisioned, and the triage continues.” “All three levels of our courts are being impacted solely because our governor and our Legislature can’t fill these vacancies, and they are hurting the public,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Cowboys for Trump founder Couy Griffin is fighting to keep his seat as a county commissioner as he faces possible removal and disqualification from public office for his participation in last year’s insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Griffin was previously convicted of a misdemeanor for entering Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Three residents of Santa Fe and Los Alamos counties filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Griffin from being commissioner of Otero County’s 2nd district for the rest of his term. Griffin, a 47-year-old Republican, is representing himself in the two-day bench trial that began Monday. “This lawsuit is about removing a duly elected county commissioner from office through the civil court,” Griffin said in court. “By allowing this case to move forward, you’re going to set a very dangerous precedent.” On the witness stand Monday, Griffin said he went to Washington, D.C., to peacefully protest and pray with other Trump supporters. “I had no intention of breaking the law on that day,” he said. The three plaintiffs in the case argued in a 259-page petition that Griffin should be disqualified from holding public office on the basis of a clause in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is endorsing Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler in his contentious primary contest with another veteran U.S. House member from the state, Carolyn Maloney. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that “New York has a lot of outstanding leaders but few of them lead with the courage, conviction, and brilliant legislative effectiveness” that Nadler has. He called Nadler a “critical partner” who “was right on the issues years before so many others.” Nadler, 75, and Maloney, 76, have each represented Manhattan-area districts in Congress for 30 years but have gone from allies to rivals after their Upper West Side and Upper East Side districts were drawn together under new redistricting maps. Schumer’s backing comes on the heels of Nadler winning an endorsement from The New York Times over the weekend ahead of the Aug. 23 primary. The newspaper’s endorsement carries a lot of weight in deep-blue New York City but is expected to be especially decisive in a contest featuring two veteran lawmakers. Nadler and Maloney chair the powerful House Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectively. Another Democrat, 38-year-old attorney Suraj Patel, is also running in the primary race for New York’s 12th District.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: After receiving more than a dozen reports of conduct violations by party-appointed poll watchers during the May primaries, the state elections board tightened regulations for precinct observers Tuesday to prevent partisan interference in the November general election. The board unanimously voted to approve temporary rules for the upcoming election that more clearly outline the code of conduct for partisan observers, prohibiting them from standing close to a “tabulator, laptop, pollbook or other voting document” where they could view marked ballots or confidential voter information. The revisions heighten scrutiny for observers and poll workers alike, adding to a list of prohibited conduct for precinct officials that forbids them from tampering with voting equipment or expressing their political views on the job. While poll watching has been an element of electoral transparency since the 1800s, the practice grew in prominence in the 2020 election cycle due to ex-President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. A survey of county elections directors in late May found violations in 15 North Carolina counties, where officials observed poll watchers harassing voters and attempting to enter restricted areas to view confidential voting records.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Monday that he’ll work with legislators on a bill next session to “guarantee that the opportunity exists” for students and elected governing bodies to say the Pledge of Allegiance, if they choose. The Republican governor’s announcement comes after the Fargo School Board last week announced plans to stop reciting the pledge on the grounds that it doesn’t align with the district’s diversity code. Under current state law, governing bodies and schools can’t be required to recite the pledge. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor’s aim is to ensure that those who wish to say it may legally do so. “America is the land of opportunity. And students in every public school in North Dakota, along with elected governing bodies and those who attend their meetings, should have the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and express support for the American ideals upon which our country was founded,” Burgum said in a statement. “Our administration is creating a framework for legislation to guarantee that the opportunity exists to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, as other states have done,” the statement said. Burgum said he is working with state Sen. Scott Meyer of Grand Forks and state Reps. Pat Heinert of Bismarck and Todd Porter of Mandan to draft the legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio mothers who rely on Medicaid will now be eligible for up to a year of health coverage after the birth of a child, up from 60 days previously. Up to 21,000 low-income and disabled people annually will benefit from this change, said the Ohio Department of Medicaid, which announced the change before April but only received final approval from the federal government Tuesday. “We know that access to postpartum care not only saves lives but leads to better health outcomes for moms and their babies,” Maureen Corcoran, director of Ohio Medicaid, said in a statement. “Extending eligibility for a full year postpartum ensures women have access to critical services that impact maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the health of their baby.” Available coverage includes treatment for postpartum depression; medical care for chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes; breastfeeding resources; and nurse home visits. The change was initiated by state lawmakers in the previous state budget. Ohio suffers from one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation, at 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. The extended coverage, for now, will be available for a five-year period through April 2027.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt granted death row inmate Richard Glossip a 60-day stay of execution Tuesday while a state appeals court considers his claim of innocence. Stitt signed an executive order delaying Glossip’s execution for the 1997 killing of Glossip’s boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, that was scheduled for Sept. 22. “This stay is granted to allow time for the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to address a pending legal proceeding,” the order said. A Stitt spokeswoman declined to comment on the governor’s decision, which also means that a clemency hearing before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that was scheduled for next week will be delayed. Glossip asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for a new evidentiary hearing following the release of an independent investigation by Houston law firm Reed Smith that raised new questions about his guilt. The firm’s report did not find any definitive proof of Glossip’s innocence but raised concerns about lost or destroyed evidence and a detective asking leading questions to Glossip’s co-defendant, Justin Sneed, to implicate Glossip in the slaying. Sneed admitted killing Van Treese but said he did so at Glossip’s direction. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison and was a key witness against Glossip.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s chief justice fired all the members of the Public Defense Services Commission on Monday, frustrated that hundreds of defendants charged with crimes and who cannot afford an attorney have been unable to obtain public defenders to represent them. The unprecedented action comes as Oregon’s unique public defender system has come under such strain that it is at the breaking point. Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation due to a shortage of public defenders filed a lawsuit in May that alleges the state is violating their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. In a letter to the commission members, Chief Justice Martha Walters said that “it is now clear that it is time to reconstitute the current commission.” Oregon’s public defender system is the only one in the nation that relies entirely on contractors: Large nonprofit defense firms, smaller cooperating groups of private defense attorneys that contract for cases and independent attorneys who can take cases at will. But some firms and private attorneys are periodically refusing to take new cases because of the workload. Poor pay rates and late payments from the state are also a disincentive. The American Bar Association found that Oregon has only 31% of the public defenders it needs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBerwick: Two people remained in critical condition Tuesday after a car drove through a crowd at a weekend fundraiser for victims of a house fire, killing one woman and injuring 17 other people, authorities said. Of the 17 injured, two remained in critical condition in Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, while five others were listed as fair, a hospital spokesperson said. Ten other people had been released following treatment at several hospitals, state police said. Adrian Oswaldo Sura Reyes, 24, is charged with homicide in the death of 50-year-old Rebecca Reese, of Wilkes-Barre, at the fundraiser in Berwick shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He faces another homicide count in the slaying of his mother at their Nescopeck home minutes later. Police allege in a criminal complaint that Sura Reyes told investigators he was driving in Berwick after arguing with his mother. At the time, about 75 people were in a blocked-off parking lot outside the Intoxicology Department bar for a fundraiser to benefit victims of the Aug. 5 blaze in Nescopeck that killed seven adults and three children. Police say Sura Reyes told them he drove past, then turned and headed back “to drive through the crowd of people.” They allege that video corroborates his alleged statement to investigators that he “sped up into the crowd purposefully.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A carousel that’s the last vestige of an amusement park next to the Providence River is spinning again after getting a new foundation. The Crescent Park carousel started running again Aug. 6 and will continue to operate Saturdays and Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. until Oct. 10, as well as on three Fridays: Aug. 26, Sept. 23 and Oct. 21. Rides cost $2. Having sat closed since the start of the pandemic, as cleaning procedures would have damaged the antique horses, dragons and a camel, crews used the time to stabilize and then replace the carousel’s foundation. This month, as it cranked up again after the hiatus, the carousel gave 958 rides. Carousel Manager Tracy Johnson is training new staff members on how to operate the attraction. Caretaker Ed Serowik said he started working at what was then the Crescent Amusement Park as a child in 1948, setting up pins at the bowling alley before working the carousel in 1950. He is now one of the primary people conducting maintenance on the ride. “It’s exactly the same,” he said, looking up at the mirrors that ring the carousel.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A small group of state lawmakers have given their approval to a near-total abortion ban that does not include exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The 3-1 vote Tuesday – all Republicans on a House subcomittee for it and the lone Democrat against – set up a showdown later in the day on whether to send the restrictive bill to the House floor. South Carolina currently has a six-week ban passed in 2021 that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Republican lawmakers plan a special sessions over the next month to consider even more restrictions. The bill bans all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. It lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into the exceptions. The legislation still has a long way to go before it could reach Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who has said he wants to see no abortions in the state. Opponents and supporters alike said the proposal could change considerably on its way through the General Assembly. Outside the House’s office building on Statehouse grounds, about a dozen demonstrators with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic gathered. They were outnumbered by law enforcement, who set fencing and barricades expected to stay up most of the week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Final vehicle counts for vehicles entering Sturgis indicate traffic was up 2% from the past five years during the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation. A total of 502,835 vehicles entered Sturgis over 10 days, according to SDDOT. The previous five-year average was 492,535 vehicles. The first day of the rally on Aug. 5 had 11% more traffic than the past five years, according to SDDOT.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Predators Foundation is teaming up on an event offering people gift cards, preseason vouchers and giveaways if they turn in guns to the city’s police. The NHL team says its foundation is partnering on the event Saturday at Greater Revelations Missionary Baptist Church. People can turn in guns to the Metro Nashville Police Department there with no questions asked. They can also drop off unused or expired medication that police will destroy. In seven Gift Card for Guns days since 2011, people turned in 658 firearms. It’s the first year the Preds Foundation has been involved in the event. Predators Vice President of Community Relations Rebecca King expressed hope that the initiative would make the community safer.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As they consider pay raises for other city employees, the Austin City Council’s members this week are poised to give themselves a 40% pay raise – one some members defend as long overdue and more reflective of the hours they work. The topic will come up Wednesday as the council works on setting the city’s operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The money for the pay increase would come from the additional $20 million the city recently discovered for the council to spend in any way it sees fit. Several council members say there is enough money available not only to boost their pay but also to identify an estimated $5 million to $10 million needed to raise the minimum hourly wage for city employees to $20. In total, the council pay raises would cost the city’s taxpayers an additional $371,000 per year. “The dollar amount we’re talking about is very little in the scheme of things,” Council Member Ann Kitchen said. This year, Austin’s 10 district council members are each making $83,158 – about the same as a sixth-year officer with the Austin Police Department. The last time the council approved a pay increase for themselves was in 2006, when a council member made $57,736 and the mayor made $67,981. Since then, they’ve received only cost-of-living increases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Democratic Party is suspending a longtime lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct from party-related activities at all levels and has called for state Sen. Gene Davis to step down from the Legislature. The decision, announced in a statement over the weekend, came after a former intern’s allegation exposed a rift in the party over its handling of sexual harassment. In prior statements, the party’s stance was that it couldn’t take action unless it received an official complaint, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Following Ms. Weglinski’s statement last week, party leaders and members of the Executive Committee spoke privately with Senator Davis,” Utah Democratic Party Executive Director Thom DeSirant wrote in the statement. “Though he denied specifics of the allegations in his interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, we believe the behavior he acknowledged, regardless of context or intent, was unacceptable. We requested he voluntarily step down.” University of Utah student Sonia Weglinski, a former intern who also worked on the senator’s reelection campaign this spring, said in an Aug. 3 Instagram post that Davis touched her in ways that made her feel uncomfortable on multiple occasions during the five months she worked with him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The certification of last week’s primary election results in Vermont has been delayed by a technical issue, the secretary of state’s office announced Tuesday. The statewide and federal primary election canvassing was expected to take place Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office said a state software contractor has been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks. The process is separate from the official counting of ballots and local certification by town clerks, the office said, adding that the delay does not impact its 100% confidence in the accuracy of the vote totals reported by town clerks. “The Secretary of State’s mission is to provide a secure and accurate election. The office will always default to a delay to ensure integrity and confidence of the results when they are certified,” the office said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An author’s investigative effort to uncover the origins of a racist photo on Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page has ended inconclusively, according to the author, who has written a book that offers new details about the 2019 scandal and the former governor’s remarkable political survival. “Of course, I would like to have determined exactly who was in the photograph. And I gave that my best effort,” Margaret Edds, a retired journalist and the author of “What the Eyes Can’t See,” told The Associated Press ahead of the book’s November publication. Although Edds – like journalists and two groups of law firm investigators before her – did not arrive at any definitive answer about the photo of one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume, her 296-page book offers a behind-the-scenes look at the turmoil the image sparked. The book details Northam’s decision to remain in office despite tremendous pressure, as well as the steps he took to become better informed about the legacy of racism, redeem his reputation and work with Black leaders to sharpen his administration’s focus on racial justice. Northam participated in 14 interviews for the book. “What the Eyes Can’t See” also draws on interviews with Northam’s wife, staffers, consultants, friends and public officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The West Seattle Bridge will open Sept. 18, according to the Seattle Department of Transportation. The date is the most specific milestone set by the city since the bridge closed more than two years ago due to safety concerns, and it provides weary West Seattle travelers with a beacon of hope. The city previously set the week of Sept. 12 as its window for reopening the bridge but hedged the announcement with caveats about possible unanticipated hiccups in the final stretch of construction. The date provided Thursday reflects the progress crews have made in recent months, most notably the final post-tensioning of nearly 50 miles of new cable, which compress the span of the bridge to strengthen the concrete, The Seattle Times reports. The cables are anchored by concrete blocks capable of holding 20 million pounds of force. SDOT previously hoped to open the bridge in July, but a labor strike of concrete workers delayed progress. The 40-year-old bridge is among the city’s most important, previously allowing 100,000 drivers and 20,000 transit users to move between West Seattle and the rest of the city every day.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is making it easier for residents to get a REAL ID ahead of the May 3 federal deadline. The department recently announced a new online service that offers a guided path through pre-enrollment and cuts the time spent at the DMV, according to a news release. REAL ID Headstart allows applicants to verify their identities, upload required documents, and schedule their REAL ID appointments online. While the federal REAL ID Act requires documents be presented in person, a change is in progress. Once the act is amended, the DMV aims to enhance REAL ID Headstart so that no in-person visit is needed. Congress passed the Real ID Act in 2005 to establish minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The updated identification cards will be required for airport check-in and to enter federal facilities. REAL ID Headstart is available at dmv.wv.gov.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state can’t impose property taxes on tribal lands that have changed hands unless it gets congressional approval, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The decision from a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marks another chapter in a lawsuit four Chippewa tribes from northern Wisconsin filed in 2018. The Lac Courte Oreilles, the Lac du Flambeau, the Red Cliff and the Bad River sued after the state imposed property taxes on land within their reservations. Such land is immune from state property taxes under an 1854 treaty, but the state argued that the land is eligible because tribal members sold it to non-American Indians before the land was were sold back to tribal members. The three-judge panel affirmed that the land isn’t taxable without congressional approval, saying only Congress can diminish tribes’ sovereignty, and the treaty is best read to promise tax immunity even for reacquired lands.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The tax incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act and a $2.5 billion infusion from Congress last year are spurring hopes of more carbon storage projects in the rolling prairie lands of northeastern Wyoming. Geologist Fred McLaughlin has been drilling nearly 2 miles into the ground, far deeper than the thick coal seams that make this the top coal-mining region in the United States. McLaughlin and his University of Wyoming colleagues are studying whether tiny spaces in rock deep underground can permanently store vast volumes of greenhouse gas emitted by a coal-fired power plant. The concept known as carbon storage has long been touted as an answer to global warming that preserves the energy industry’s burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity. One goal of McLaughlin’s project is to preserve the lifespan of a relatively new coal-fired power plant, Dry Fork Station, run by Basin Electric Power Cooperative. State officials hope it will do the same for the whole beleaguered coal industry that still underpins Wyoming’s economy. The state produces about 40% of the nation’s coal, but declining production and a series of layoffs and bankruptcies have beset the Gillette area’s vast, open-pit coal mines over the past decade.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}]}

A resident attempted to make s'mores and used cardboard to light up the fire.\n\nDetectives suspect that strong winds on Saturday quickly spread embers from the backyard fire, which ignited several blazes in eastern Long Island, Catalina added. Twenty-five detectives are still investigating the cause of the fires. The investigation involves drones, helicopters, and a review of everyone who called 911 about the blazes, Catalina said.\n\n\"Our investigation is pointing strongly towards an accidental origin for Saturday's fires,\" Catalina asserted during a news conference Monday afternoon. \"We still have a couple of things to do. We want to interview every 911 caller. We want to run down every crime stopper's lead — just to rule every possibility out.\"\n\nAt least four wildfires erupted, burning an estimated 600 acres. By Sunday evening, the largest of the wildfires, which burned in the Pine Barrens, was 100% contained and other fires were under control, authorities added.\n\nOn Monday, authorities confirmed that the fires were completely contained with a hard line. Amanda Lefton, the acting commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said crews will continue to patrol over the next few days to prevent any spot fires.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency and implemented a burn ban for Long Island.\n\n\"The New York State burn ban, which generally takes into effect on March 16, takes effect immediately on places like Long Island, where we're seeing a heightened risk of fire,\" Lefton said. \"Make sure that you are complying with that burn ban. Make sure that we are really minimizing our risk of fire as we continue to see high winds, relatively low humidity and other conditions that make this region a little bit more prone to the fire risk.\"\n\nLong Island authorities offer preliminary timeline of fires\n\nDuring Monday's news conference, Catalina provided a preliminary timeline for the suspected cause of the fires.\n\nDetectives believe that the initial fire started at around 9:30 a.m. Saturday when a person in Manorville was trying to make s’mores, according to Catalina. The police commissioner said the person was initially unable to light a fire due to the winds.\n\nThe person then used cardboard to spark the fire, which caused the backyard area to erupt in flames, Catalina said. That fire was extinguished at about 10:30 a.m.\n\nBut a few hours later, shortly before 1 p.m., Catalina said authorities received a fire report on the south side of Sunrise Highway — less than a quarter mile from the backyard fire. Catalina added that two other fires were later reported.\n\n\"If you remember that day, the wind was blowing very strongly from the northwest, so that path makes perfect sense,\" Catalina said. \"It is believed that the embers from each fire traveled and continuously started more fires.\"\n\nAuthorities previously said two firefighters were injured while battling the blazes, including one firefighter who suffered burns to his face. Two commercial buildings were also damaged, but no residential buildings were impacted.\n\nSouth Carolina authorities arrest suspect accused of igniting wildfire\n\nElsewhere, authorities in South Carolina arrested a woman they say started a blaze that triggered evacuations and consumed more than 2,000 acres near Myrtle Beach.\n\nAlexandra Bialousow, 40, of Myrtle Beach, faces two charges related to accusations that she did not take proper precautions while burning debris in her backyard and negligently allowed the fire to spread well past her property line, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.\n\nThe commission said witnesses reported seeing Bialousow start a fire without \"an appropriate water source readily available\" and without \"any garden tools on hand to control the fire.\" As of Sunday, the fire was 55% contained, the commission confirmed.\n\nNearly 85% of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans, whether unknowingly or intentionally, according to the National Parks Service.

When Young tried to flee the officers in her vehicle, one of them fired his weapon, striking and killing the woman and her unborn daughter.\n\nThe death of Young, who is Black, sparked outrage and sadness across a country that had just three years earlier endured waves of protests – some of them violent – after the murder of George Floyd. In a series of protests and vigils after Young's shooting death, activists and family members called for the arrest of the officer who fired the gun.\n\nNow, little more than a week shy of the first anniversary of Young's death, that officer, Connor Grubb, has been indicted by a grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, according to the Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nHere's what to know about Young's death and Grubb's indictment on Tuesday.\n\nWho is Ta'Kiya Young?\n\nYoung was the mother of two sons, who were 6 and 3 years old at the time of her death. When she was shot, Young was also pregnant with a daughter who her family said was due that November.\n\nYoung's death sparked several peaceful vigils in her memory and in honor of her unborn daughter.\n\nIn the days after her death, local activists and protest groups met at the Kroger to call for justice and accountability in the shooting. More than two dozen family and friends also gathered within days of her death at Young's grandmother's home, where they lit candles in memory of Young and her unborn child.\n\nAt Young's funeral Sept. 7, mourners wore pink and white to celebrate her favorite colors.\n\nWhat do we know about Ta'Kiya Young's death?\n\nBody camera footage released by Blendon Township police within about a week of Young's death showed the point of view of the two officers who approached Young on Aug. 24, 2023.\n\nThe officers, who were in the parking lot of a Kroger on an unrelated call, had been flagged down by a store employee who accused Young and several others of shoplifting items from the store, including liquor.\n\nIn the footage, Young can be seen already in the four-door sedan when one officer approaches the driver's side and the other approaches the front of the vehicle. One officer tells her to step out of the vehicle, prompting Young to partially roll down her window and ask, \"For what?\"\n\nEventually, the video shows Young driving forward and hitting the officer in front of her car – now identified as Grubb –whose feet are seen off the ground when he fires a single shot through the windshield. Young's vehicle continued moving forward until it hit the building.\n\nA passerby who happened to be an emergency room doctor assisted police at the scene until paramedics arrived and took Young to Mount Carmel St. Ann's hospital, where she died.\n\nAn autopsy confirmed that Young died from gunshot wounds to her chest. The officers were not aware Young was pregnant, police later said.\n\nAfter the shooting, Blendon Township police requested that the Ohio Attorney General's Bureau of Criminal Investigation investigate the shooting. The procedure is standard among police agencies in Ohio when one of their officers kills or injures someone in a shooting.\n\nWho is Connor Grubb, officer who shot Young?\n\nGrubb, 29, has been a Blendon Township police officer since 2019, according to records from the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy.\n\nIt is the only police agency Grubb has worked for in Ohio. He and the other officer who approached Young that day were initially placed on paid administrative leave, but as of Monday, Grubb was listed as a full-time officer with the agency.\n\nAfter news of Grubb's indictment, Blendon Township Police Chief John Belford said in a video statement that the agency is starting the disciplinary process \"immediately.\"\n\n\"I want to be very clear: We're not passing any judgment on whether officer Grubb acted properly,\" Belford said. \"We haven't seen the evidence.\"\n\nGrubb attended the Delaware Area Career Center’s law enforcement program before being hired in Blendon Township.\n\nWhat has Grubb been charged with in Young's death?\n\nGrubb faces four counts of murder, four counts of felonious assault and two counts of involuntary manslaughter, according to an indictment filed Tuesday in Franklin County Common Pleas Court.\n\nTwo of the murder counts are related to Young's death, and the other two counts stem from the death of her unborn baby.\n\nUnder Ohio law, a person can be charged with multiple counts related to different theories of how a death occurred. In Grubb's case, he is charged in all four counts of causing the death of Young and her unborn daughter as a proximate cause of a felonious assault, commonly called felony murder.\n\nThough a Franklin County grand jury heard the case against Grubb, it was the Montgomery County Prosecutor's office west of Columbus that presented it. The Franklin County Prosecutor's office had requested the outside agency review and present the case because of a simple conflict of interested: The prosecutor's office would be the agency to represent Blendon Township in any civil lawsuits.\n\nYoung's family has not filed a civil lawsuit but could file one at any time up to two years from the date of her death.\n\nWhat are people saying about Grubb's murder indictment?\n\nColumbus attorney Sean Walton, who represents Young's family, said in a statement: \"Ta'Kiya’s life and that of her daughter were extinguished in an act of brutality, becoming yet another symbol of the urgent need for reform in police conduct and accountability.\"\n\nNadine Young, Young's grandmother, said at a news conference Tuesday: \"It was wrong for him to take her and that baby out of this world.\"\n\nMark Collins and Kaitlyn Stephens , local attorneys who have represented other police officers indicted in on-duty shootings, said in a statement Tuesday that \"when viewed through the eyes of a reasonable police officer, the evidence will show that our client's actions were justified when there is video evidence that Officer Grubb was hit by a moving vehicle. ... This case is not about if Connor Grubb made the decision to use deadly force, but why he made the decision to use deadly force.\"\n\n, local attorneys who have represented other police officers indicted in on-duty shootings, said in a statement Tuesday that \"when viewed through the eyes of a reasonable police officer, the evidence will show that our client's actions were justified when there is video evidence that Officer Grubb was hit by a moving vehicle. ...

Curing typically results from a signature mismatch between the state’s electronic records system and the signature on the ballot.\n\n“Curing is normal,” said Ahtar Haseebullah, executive director for the ACLU of Nevada, who’s noticed the high rate of rejected ballots in statewide elections since 2020. “It’s not unexpected these last few years.”\n\nHaseebullah said while the current number is high, the curing measure ensures ballot accuracy.\n\n“That number is expected to decrease in the next few days compared to where it is today,” Haseebullah said. “Everybody’s working to get the number reduced. it’s just a part of the process here.\"\n\nHaseebullah said the problem typically works itself out once the mail-in ballot signatures are verified.\n\n“It’s either they relax the current rule or they eliminate the ability to vote by mail and both of those options would be problematic,” he said.\n\n−Terry Collins\n\nPennsylvania poll sites targeted with bomb threats\n\nSeveral polling places in Pennsylvania were targeted with bomb threats less than two hours before polls closed on Election Day, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nGov.

But they were turning away students who lacked a state-issued ID, she said.By 4 p.m., countywide, about 1,200 ballots had been set aside to be “cured,” typically caused by a signature mismatch between the state’s electronic records system and the signature on the ballot.

Absolutely.”\n\nWhen the opponents to the amendment set up there during early voting, “we were very upset,” Boye said. “We escalated it to our state lawyers, and they said there’s nothing we can do.”\n\n“There’s an advisory opinion that leaves it an open question whether that kind of activity can occur on private property,” Boye said. The six-page advisory opinion was issued in 2020 on state letterhead by Maria Matthews, director of the state division of the elections in response to a query by Hillsborough County’s elections supervisor.\n\nThe opinion outlined previous case law, but ultimately declined to advise whether the supervisor could impose the no-solicitation zone against a private property owner, unless the activity begins to interfere with maintenance of order at the polls.\n\n“If the rule is there that no one should be in the zone, no one should be in the zone,” said Jewel Dickson, chair of the Volusia County Democratic Party. “I couldn’t care whether it’s private property or not no one should be in that zone if it’s protected for voters.”\n\n“If you live there, you should be allowed to have a sign, but we don’t want them trying to proselytize voters,” she added.\n\n-Dinah Pulver\n\nMilwaukee rerunning more than 30,000 absentee ballots over machine error, delaying results\n\nMilwaukee's central count location will rerun about 31,000 ballots after a \"sealing\" error with the tabulation machines was discovered at the downtown site, potentially delaying a final count by one to three hours, city spokesman Jeff Fleming said.\n\n\"It's just out of an abundance of caution.

Interest in partisan observers has grown as politicking grew more polarized.\n\n“In this particular election, there has been greater interest,” Heck said. “In part that has been sparked by election deniers and conspiracy theorists who are always trying to figure out how nefarious election clerks are, which of course isn’t the case.”\n\nA large number of observers are expected Tuesday night at central facilities where absentee ballots are counted in Milwaukee and Green Bay.\n\n“Generally, the process hasn’t been interrupted. It generally is civilized and there is no problems,” Heck said. “But with the high tension and the high velocity and the high temperature of this election, I think everybody is just watching carefully to see how this new universe of partisan observers is going to behave. So far so good.

He said he and his opponent are friendly and are prepared to accept the results of the election.\n\nHe said there is most likely to be litigation if the outcome is close, but if a candidate wins by 3 percentage points or more, litigation becomes less likely. He also said he is not concerned about violence, and praised the poll workers inside Ebenezer Baptist Church in Pittsburgh for their hard work.\n\n“There may be a certain individual who candidates on both sides agree may be the biggest cry baby out there on this issue,” DePasquale said, referring to Donald Trump. “I can’t control whether someone who’s nearly 80 years old still hasn’t grown up yet.

In a lawsuit filed Friday, the Republican National Committee and state Republican Party alleged Fulton County officials were violating the law by accepting the ballots outside regular office hours.\n\nBut Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer quoted the law aloud to GOP lawyers during an emergency hearing.\n\n“’Such envelope shall then be securely sealed, and the Elector shall then personally mail or personally deliver same to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk,’” Farmer said. “That seems to indicate that personal delivery to the registrar and not to a drop box, is kosher.

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were found guilty of violating George Floyd’s civil rights by a federal jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday.\n\nThe 12 jurors – four men and eight women – found Lane, Kueng and Thao guilty of depriving Floyd of his civil rights by showing deliberate indifference to his medical needs as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd for more than 9 minutes on May 25, 2020, ultimately killing him. The jurors also found Thao and Kueng guilty of an additional charge for failing to intervene to stop Chauvin. Lane, who did not face the extra charge, testified that he asked Chauvin twice to reposition Floyd while restraining him but was denied both times.\n\nViolating a person’s civil rights “is punishable by a range of imprisonment up to a life term, or the death penalty, depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and the resulting injury, if any,” according to the Department of Justice. Federal sentencing guidelines suggest the officers could receive a lesser sentence.\n\nThe three men remain free on bond and are expected to start pre-sentencing proceedings next week.\n\nThe charges stemmed from the officers’ actions – or lack thereof – as Chauvin pressed his knee into the neck and back of Floyd, who was handcuffed and lying on his stomach on the pavement. Kueng and Lane, both rookie officers, held down Floyd’s torso and legs, respectively, while Thao stood nearby and kept a crowd of upset bystanders back.\n\n“This is just accountability, it can never be justice because I can never get George back,” Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said in a news conference Thursday evening.\n\nThe case quickly gripped the nation’s attention two years ago when a bystander’s video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck as the 46-year-old Black man pleaded he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s last words became a rallying cry during a summer of global protests against police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nSeeking justice: A timeline since the death of George Floyd\n\n“Today closes another important chapter in our journey for justice for George Floyd and his family,” the Floyd legal team, including attorney Ben Crump, said in a statement after the verdict on Thursday. They added that the verdicts should serve as an example of why police departments “should expand and prioritize instruction on an officer’s duty to intervene and recognize when a fellow officer is using excessive force.”\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the verdict “recognizes that two police officers violated the Constitution by failing to intervene to stop another officer from killing George Floyd, and three officers violated the Constitution by failing to provide aid to Mr. Floyd in time to prevent his death,” in a statement Thursday.\n\n“George Floyd should be alive today,” Garland added.\n\nChauvin was convicted last spring of murder and manslaughter in a state trial and was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. Lane, Kueng and Thao, will face a state trial in June on charges of aiding and abetting in the killing, which was pushed back so the federal proceedings could take place first. They have pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\n“We hope, and we expect, that these officers will once again be held accountable for their lack of humanity,” the Floyd legal team said in their statement Thursday.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to the federal civil rights charges related to Floyd’s death and the restraint of a teenager in a separate incident. He now faces between 20 and 25 years in prison. Prosecutors requested that he be sentenced to 25 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the sentence from his state trial.\n\nGeorge Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, speaking during a news conference after the verdict was announced on Thursday. KARE\n\nWhat prosecutors had to prove\n\nAt the start of deliberations, the judge instructed jurors that to find the three officers guilty of violating Floyd’s rights, they had to find that Floyd had “an objectively serious medical need,” that the defendants knew about it and disregarded that need “by failing to take reasonable measures to address it.”\n\nFor Thao and Kueng’s extra charge, jurors were instructed there were multiple conditions to find guilt.\n\n“In order to find that any defendant failed to intervene in violation of the Constitution, you must find that the defendant saw Derek Chauvin use force, that the defendant recognized that the use of force was unreasonable, that the defendant had a realistic opportunity to prevent further harm from occurring, and that the defendant chose not to do so,” the instructions read.\n\nBoth of the counts dealt with critical definitions about whether the officers acted willfully and with specific intent – critical definitions which were argued back and forth during the trial by prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nProsecutors argued in trial that Floyd could have survived the arrest but that the three officers, despite knowing the amount of force that was being used, chose not to intervene and save Floyd’s life as he repeatedly complained he couldn’t breathe under Chauvin’s knee.\n\n“It wasn’t a split-second use of force like a gunshot,” Assistant US Attorney Manda Sertich said during closing arguments, referring to Thao and Kueng’s extra charge of not intervening to stop Chauvin. “Not 30 seconds, not a minute, several minutes – 569 seconds.”\n\nThe officers’ defense attorneys argued their clients did not willfully fail to help Floyd, with Thao’s lawyer saying in closing arguments that “just because something has a tragic ending doesn’t mean it’s a crime.” Attorneys for Kueng and Lane pointed out their clients had insufficient training and were subordinate to Chauvin, who was a longtime veteran of the force. “We don’t need commanders to tell us that if someone has seniority over you, you listen to them,” Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, told the court Tuesday. “It’s common sense.”\n\n“They didn’t have to intend to harm Mr. Floyd,” Assistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell countered during her rebuttal argument Tuesday. “They just needed to know they could take certain actions under the law and failed to do so.”\n\nJurors deliberated for roughly 13 hours over two days before reaching their verdict.\n\nHow the fatal arrest of George Floyd unfolded 04:33 - Source: CNN How the fatal arrest of George Floyd unfolded 04:33\n\nThe officers testified in the trial\n\nThe three officers’ federal trial began on January 24.\n\nDarnella Frazier, the now 18-year-old girl who recorded the cell phone video of Floyd’s death, testified she was accompanying her cousin to the Cup Foods store when they encountered officers and a man on the ground who was saying, “I can’t breathe.”\n\n“I didn’t see George Floyd resist at all,” Frazier told the court, but added that Chauvin remained on top of him. Frazier testified she saw Floyd’s nose bleeding as he became unresponsive and then “unconscious.”\n\nHere’s what the three officers said on the stand\n\nEach of the three former officers took the stand to testify about their thoughts and actions during the restraint, a stark contrast from Chauvin’s silence during his state trial.\n\nKueng and Lane were the first officers to respond to the Cup Foods store on that day after reports that Floyd had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. They later helped Chauvin restrain Floyd – Kueng held down Floyd’s torso while Lane held his legs – and Thao held back a group of bystanders shouting at the officers to get off Floyd.\n\nThao, the first of the three to testify, told the court he assumed the other officers on the scene were “taking care” of Floyd, and that his role transitioned to crowd and traffic control. He testified that he was aware that Lane and Kueng were new officers and said that while he saw Chauvin put a knee to Floyd’s neck, it was not uncommon to see Minneapolis officers use their knee when making an arrest. When prosecutors asked Thao during cross-examination why he didn’t tell Chauvin to get off Floyd’s neck, he said: “I think I would trust a 19-year veteran to figure it out.”\n\nKueng told jurors last week that he deferred to Chauvin on what to do during the arrest – as other officers did in certain situations as well – since Chauvin was the senior officer on scene with more than 15 years of experience. Kueng testified he was stressed and could not tell how much pressure Chauvin was using with his knee, adding he believed Floyd was still breathing when emergency responders arrived. He told prosecutors during cross-examination that, while he did not have much experience with handling large individuals who were resisting arrest, he was not aware or trained for the “technique using the leg.”\n\nLane, the second rookie officer, testified Monday he tried to de-escalate the situation outside the Cup Foods and that when Chauvin arrived, he “either asked or cut in front of me,” and later informed Floyd he was under arrest for forgery. Lane testified he asked Chauvin twice if they should reposition Floyd during restraint because he was worried about “excited delirium” – which he defined as “basically an adrenaline overdose” – and Chauvin said no.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Lane said he started CPR about five minutes after Kueng said he could not find a pulse, adding that, ideally, CPR should be started immediately after a pulse cannot be found.", "authors": ["Julia Jones Christina Maxouris", "Julia Jones", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/30/george-floyd-protests-hundreds-arrested-national-guard-curfews/5291442002/", "title": "Fires, a shooting, curfews, arrests: George Floyd protests turn to ...", "text": "Demonstrations across the country again devolved into unrest Saturday, a day after a Minneapolis police officer was arrested and charged with the third-degree murder and manslaughter of George Floyd.\n\nPolice cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews.

For the latest updates on the LA fires, follow USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, Jan. 14.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Ominous winds were expected to regain strength Monday, howling through fire-blackened trees, picking up plumes of ash and smoke and further tangling efforts to tamp down the explosion of fires across Los Angeles County that have killed at least 24 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses.\n\nThe winds could threaten the incremental progress firefighters made over the weekend with multiple fires. The winds that had eased somewhat Sunday, allowing firefighters and rescue crews to begin gaining some control, were forecast to return later Monday, with coastal winds reaching 40-50 mph.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Los Angeles office highlighted Red Flag Warning areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties that received the rare \"particularly dangerous situation'' designation, saying those are for \"the extreme of the extreme fire weather scenarios.'' The Red Flag Warnings for a larger stretch of Southern California are in place from Monday through Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Conditions are expected to worsen for these locations by Tuesday morning as wind gusts near 70 mph will be possible,\" NWS meteorologist Walter Otto said in a Monday weather update, citing the wind combined with low relative humidity and lack of recent rainfall. \"These locations will be under a high risk for large fires with potential for very rapid spreading of any fires that may develop.\"\n\nThe weather service said \"critical to extremely critical fire weather conditions'' are predicted for the full coastal area in Southern California through Wednesday, stretching all the way down to San Diego, prompting officials to pre-position firefighting crews in vulnerable locations.\n\nThe number of people under evacuation orders dropped to 92,000 on Monday, down from almost 200,000 people days ago, Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna said at a morning briefing. Another 89,000 were under evacuation warnings.\n\nLuna urged residents still being kept from their homes to be patient while \"grid searching\" for victims continues. He said he expects the death toll to rise.\n\n\"It is a very grim task, and unfortunately every day that we do this we are running across the remains of individuals, community members,\" Luna said. \"That is not easy work.\"\n\nMore than 1,800 properties have been searched, he said, adding that 34 arrests have been made ranging from curfew violations to looting.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, the two most damaging active blazes, were 14% and 33% contained, respectively, according to Cal Fire's latest updates Monday night. Meanwhile, the Hurst Fire near Sylmar, California, was 97% contained.\n\n∎ At least 24 people — most of which remained unidentified — have died between the Eaton and Palisades fires, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's update Monday afternoon. The Palisades Fire had at least eight deaths, according to medical examiner records, and 16 people have died in the Eaton Fire.\n\n∎ President-elect Donald Trump plans to visit the disaster zone after next Monday's inauguration, Reuters reported.\n\n∎ The announcement of the Oscar nominations was postponed from Jan. 17 to Jan. 23, and the voting deadline was extended, because of the fires. The Oscars ceremony is still scheduled for March 2.\n\n∎ Nine persons were charged with looting in connection to the fires, and another one was charged with arson but unrelated to the ignition of the blazes still tormenting L.A.

The blaze, dubbed the Auto Fire, was first reported in the Santa Clara River bottom around 6:50 p.m. local time as Santa Ana winds whipped through the region.\n\nAs of early Tuesday, the blaze burned about five acres, according to Cal Fire. Ground crews and helicopters quickly rushed to the area, making water drops.\n\nAbout 75 firefighters were working on the fire, which was described as being in medium fuel and moving at a moderate rate of speed, the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement on social media posted shortly before 9 p.m. local time\n\n— Ventura County Star\n\nOptimism, but more high winds coming\n\nIn the storied Topanga Canyon off the Pacific Coast Highway, meditation teacher Seth Monk helped distribute coffee, gas and propane to residents who remained despite evacuation orders. The narrow canyon community sits between the blaze burning in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, which Monk said “looked like a volcano” last week.\n\nMany celebrities live in the area, mixing with longtime resident hippies and people who have fled the urban sprawl of Los Angeles. Among those who’ve called Topanga home or passed through are Neil Young, Jim Morrison and Danny Elfman, along with actor Joshua Jackson, whose house burned down last week.\n\nMonk said the clear blue skies were a cause for optimism.\n\n“The feeling is that we’re at the tail end of it and yet, because there's so much dry fuel between us and the fire and the wind is picking up, it is possible the fire could come back,” he said, as grateful residents poured oat milk into organic coffee provided by donors. “The situation appears to be getting better.”\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nWildfire victim has emotional reunion with dog\n\nAs the wildfires continue to rage in Southern California, a moment of hope broke through the smoke after a man was reunited with his dog.\n\nA video posted on X by NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz shows Casey Colvin reuniting with Oreo after the dog spent five nights in the ash in the wake of the Palisades Fire, which destroyed their Pacific Palisades home.\n\nColvin, who wasn't home when the fire broke out on Jan. 7, rushed back to try and save his two dogs: Oreo and Tika Tika Tika. First responders found Tika Tika Tika and reunited the dog with Colvin, according to NBC Nightly News. But Colvin said that Oreo, whom he described as a \"behavioral,\" ran out of the house.\n\nThe video of their emotional reunion, posted Sunday, shows Oreo wandering down a driveway to meet Colvin and Tikka Tikka Tikka. Colvin appears to be overcome with emotion upon having his dog back in his arms.\n\n\"Oh honey, you're alive, you're alive!\" he yells as he holds the dog. \"Oh, thank you, God!\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n— James Powel\n\nLA wildfire victms: These are the people who lost their lives\n\nWhat's that up in the sky? Fire retardant\n\nImages of aircraft fighting the Los Angeles area fires by dumping a reddish-pink substance from the sky have prompted questions about its contents, use and safety.\n\nThe fire retardant, which has been used for more than 50 years to tamp down wildfires, is mostly made up of salts that \"alter the way the fire burns, decreases the fire intensity and slows the advance of the fire,\" according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.\n\nMore than 440 million gallons of the product were dropped on blazes from 2009 to 2021, mostly in the western part of the country, where wildfires present a yearly challenge. However, the Forest Service forbids using the retardant near waterways or habitats of endangered species on federal lands because of environmental concerns.

And it does come down to leadership and it appears to us that state and local leaders were derelict in their duty in many respects,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters at the Capitol. \"So that's something that has to be factored in. I think there should probably be conditions on that aid. That's my personal view.\"\n\nFlorida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz responded to the remark in a post on X, saying: \"This is a mistake.\"\n\n“If you start this, it will never end,\" he said. \"When Dems retake the House, they will condition aid to Florida and Texas. Disaster Aid must stay non partisan. I would fight democrats should they try and do this. The Speaker can find many other ways to hold people accountable.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Fernando Cervantes Jr. and Riley Beggin\n\nLawsuit blames utility for sparking Eaton fire\n\nA California woman says a local utility company is responsible for sparking the Eaton fire that turned her longtime home into cinders, according to a lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nEvangeline Iglesias alleges that Southern California Edison failed to shut down its equipment despite strong warnings about the potential for devastating fires, which directly caused the blaze that consumed her Altadena house.\n\nThe cause of the Eaton fire is under investigation, according to state officials, but dry vegetation, high winds and low humidity fueled the flames once it ignited. The lawsuit cites multiple eyewitness accounts and images that appear to show a fire at the base of a transmission tower owned by the utility.\n\n“They knew like everyone else did of the severe weather warnings, dry weather, high wind gusts, they had tools they could have used to mitigate the wildfire risk,” said Iglesias’ attorney, Ali Moghaddas of the Edelson law firm. “They have choices when they face these moments and obviously they made the wrong one.”\n\nA spokesperson for Southern California Edison said the company could not comment directly on the lawsuit because it had not been served yet but said it was aware of the filing and vigorously defended its safety practices.\n\nThe company provides electricity for around 5 million customers, or about 10% of the people in the area, according to spokesperson Jeff Monford. A staff of meteorologists and fire scientists watch for potential wildfires and determine when the utility should shut down its equipment to avoid catastrophe, he said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nFBI seeking tips on drone that damaged firefighting plane\n\nThe FBI is seeking information on the operator of a drone that collided with a \"Super Scooper\" firefighting airplane over the Palisades Fire last week, damaging the aircraft and grounding it for days as flames raged across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe plane, on loan from Canada, sustained damage when it collided with a drone about 1 p.m. Thursday, according to Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott. No injuries were reported.\n\n\"The collision left a 3-by-6-inch hole in the left wing,\" the FBI said in a statement. \"Parts of the heavily damaged drone were recovered.\"\n\nThe firefighting asset, known as \"Quebec 1,\" was expected to return to the skies Tuesday morning, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said.\n\n\"It has been repaired and we're waiting for the FAA to give us approval to fly again,\" he said.\n\n– Brian Day, Victorville Daily Press\n\nBanks offer mortgage relief for affected homeowners\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are easing mortgage repayment conditions for customers affected by the devastating wildfires in Southern California.\n\nChase Home Lending is providing disaster forbearance for mortgage customers affected by the fires, parent firm JPMorgan said on Monday. BofA also said its program includes the possibility of mortgage forbearance tailored to customer needs.\n\nForbearance allows borrowers to temporarily pause repayments on their loans or pay lower amounts.\n\nBorrowers often turn to banks for such aid to help ease the cost of rebuilding. However, the strain on the industry's profitability from the unpaid loans can also prompt lenders to retreat from markets prone to natural catastrophes.

Gonzalez, Arizona Republic\n\nDamage assessments underway from Eaton Fire\n\nIncreased containment, search and rescue efforts, infrastructure assessments, hazardous material response and damage assessment missions were underway in communities along the southern edge of the Eaton Fire, Cal Fire said in an update Monday. The fire, blamed for at least 16 deaths, has damaged or destroyed more than 1,600 homes, businesses and other structures, the agency said.\n\n\"These missions are unprecedented in size and scale and are critical for mitigating existing hazards, confirming missing persons reports and obtaining accurate number of structures loss,\" the agency said in a statement. It added that stronger winds \"will contribute to increased fire activity.\"\n\nWorld Central Kitchen providing meals\n\nWorld Central Kitchen has joined the growing effort to provide food to firefighters battling the blazes and residents who have lost their homes, have no power or otherwise are struggling amid the tragedy.\n\n\"WCK will have free meals available in California for first responders and community members impacted by the Southern California wildfires,\" the disaster relief organization said in a social media post late Sunday that included a list of several distribution sites. \"Share with anyone in the area in need of support.\"\n\nWCK said it had mobilized teams across the region to provide immediate relief with sandwiches and water and that \"several WCK Chef Corps members are on standby, ready to provide comforting meals.\"\n\nWCK was founded in 2010 by acclaimed chef José Andrés, who still leads the organization.\n\nAs embers cool, a desire to rebuild\n\nThe weather on the morning of Jan. 7 felt different to Neal Flesner.

By the time Flesner left the gym in Venice Beach around 11 a.m. local time, he could already see smoke and flames filling the hills near his Pacific Palisades, California, home.\n\nIn the Alphabet Streets area of the Palisades where he and his wife lived, Flesner said there was always a feeling that they were far enough away from rural areas with the dry brush. That they were safe from the fires. But Flesner returned home to find the entire Alphabet Streets neighborhood reduced to rubble.\n\n\"I want to be part of the effort to just not rebuild the homes, but rebuild the community, rebuild the culture, rebuild the life that we all shared and loved there,\" Flesner said.

The rate, which dropped one-tenth of a percentage point from May, represented 60,388 people without jobs statewide, a record low, according to a statement by Gov. Kay Ivey. More than 2.2 million people were working in the state, an increase of about 5,300 from a month earlier.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy is expected this week to sign legislation to formally recognize tribes in the state. The Alaska Federation of Natives announced the bill signing would take place Thursday. Shannon Mason, a Dunleavy spokesperson, confirmed the timing. The measure, from state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky, D-Bethel, passed the Legislature in May. Supporters of the bill have called it an overdue step that would create opportunities for the state and tribes to work together. The Alaska Federation of Natives said the measure “does not impact the existing legal status of Alaska Tribes, nor does it change the state’s responsibility or authority. However, it does recognize Alaska’s Indigenous people. This recognition will help unify our tribal governments with the state government.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has dismissed Gov. Doug Ducey’s lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s demands the state stop sending millions in federal COVID-19 relief money to schools that don’t have mask requirements or that close because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The state filed the lawsuit earlier this year after the U.S. Treasury Department demanded Ducey either restructure the $163 million program to eliminate restrictions it said undermine public health recommendations or face a repayment demand. The Treasury Department also wanted changes to a $10 million program Ducey created that gives private school tuition money to parents if their children’s schools have mask mandates.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers took back the authority they gave for the state to distribute about $460 million in remaining federal COVID-19 relief funds to school districts, saying they want schools to use the money for teacher and staff bonuses. The move faced opposition from Democrats who said it was an effort to avoid considering raising teacher salaries while the state sits on a $1.6 billion surplus. It was also criticized by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said lawmakers didn’t have authority to take such a step. The Legislative Council voted to rescind the appropriation for the federal funds, and recommended schools use the money for bonuses. The council said the districts’ plans for spending the money will now have to go before a legislative panel. The council recommended districts use the funds to provide $5,000 one-time bonuses to teachers and $2,500 to staff.\n\nCalifornia\n\nJerseydale: A destructive wildfire near Yosemite National Park burned out of control through tinder-dry forest on Sunday and had grown into one of California’s largest blazes of the year, forcing thousands of residents to flee remote mountain communities. About 2,000 firefighters battled the fire, along with aircraft and bulldozers, facing tough conditions that includes steep terrain, sweltering temperatures and low humidity, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Crews on the ground protected homes as air tankers dropped retardant on 50-foot flames racing along ridgetops east of the small community of Jerseydale. Light winds blew embers ahead into tree branches “and because it’s so dry, it’s easy for the spot fires to get established and that’s what fuels the growth,” Fouts said. The fire erupted Friday southwest of the park near the town of Midpines in Mariposa County. Officials described “explosive fire behavior” on Saturday as flames made runs through bone-dry vegetation caused by the worst drought in decades. By Sunday the blaze had consumed more than 22 square miles of forest land, with no containment, Cal Fire said. The cause was under investigation. Evacuations were in place for more than 6,000 people living across a several-mile span of the sparsely populated area in the Sierra Nevada foothills, though a handful of residents defied the orders and stayed behind, said Adrienne Freeman with the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The West Nile virus was detected in trapped mosquitoes in the southeast and southwest parts of the city, the Larimer County health department said in a news release. As of Tuesday, there are no human cases of West Nile virus, the health department. In humans, West Nile symptoms can range from none to severe (fever, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, aches, rash and headaches) and appear three to 14 days after infection, the health department said. One percent of people might develop a serious, neuroinvasive form of the disease, said Dr. Paul Mayer, medical officer with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. Larimer County began monitoring for West Nile virus in early June. Monitoring is done through a partnership with the cities in Larimer County, Vector Disease Control International and Colorado State University. The peak West Nile season is generally in July and August.

The legislation, which increases funding for the initiative, raises the MSRP cap for eligible purchased and leased battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to $50,000. In turn, state residents who meet certain income requirements can qualify for up to $9,500 in incentives, depending on the type of vehicle. The new law will also usher in the state’s first electric bike voucher program. Dykes said the first public meeting was held this week to gather input on how to design the initiative. Additionally, the state agency has begun crafting a plan for distributing $20 million for electric school buses – spending that’s expected to trigger federal funding, as well. Meanwhile, the state is making up to $4 million available to public and private entities to purchase and install light-duty charting stations. The funding came from a 2018 settlement between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Members of the local Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape tribe gathered with other Indigenous peoples from the region to hold a powwow in the atrium of the Delaware Art Museum. Non-native people were invited to attend and, in some cases, participate in the cultural celebration. They were also encouraged to support local Indigenous artists who came to sell jewelry, shawls, bags and even bows and arrows. “This is not something to exploit,” said Iz Balleto, community engagement specialist at the museum. “We just wanted to build that bridge with the tribes that have been forgotten here in Delaware.” Social powwows are important to Indigenous peoples, Nanticoke Chief Natosha Carmine said. They’re an opportunity to see family and friends, as well as to provide education on their tribe’s history and customs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health said appointments have been made available to 5,500 people on a waiting list for the monkeypox vaccine, WUSA-TV reported. Before that announcement, DC Health said it received 8,300 doses of the JYENNOS vaccine and administered approximately 2,600. “Individuals will have 48 hours to claim their appointment,” DC Health tweeted at 10:14 a.m. Saturday. “Residents who did not receive an appointment invitation (last) week will stay in the system until an appointment becomes available.” According to CDC data last updated on Friday, there are 110 monkeypox cases in D.C., the highest number per capita in the U.S. D.C. makes up about 6% of the monkeypox cases across the United States, averaging about eight new cases a day.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Jon Auvil defeated 124 other contestants Saturday night to win the annual Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike Contest at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West establishment where the author was a regular patron during his decadelong residence on the island in the 1930s. The look-a-like contest is a highlight of Key West’s annual Hemingway Days celebration, which ended Sunday. Auvil said he shares Hemingway’s passion for fishing, has written some fiction and would like to do more writing. “Every man wants to write like Hemingway,” said Auvil, who lives in Dade City, Florida, northeast of Tampa. While living in Key West, Hemingway wrote classics, including “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “To Have and Have Not.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Police are investigating a late-night vehicle accident at Ellis Square that injured five people Saturday. A few minutes before 8 p.m., an elderly man accidentally drove his four-door Ford F-150 truck onto the square, police said. About 9 p.m., police arrived at the scene and found five people injured – two adult pedestrians with serious injuries and two juveniles with nonlife-threatening injuries. One person refused emergency services care. The four injured people were transported to Memorial University Medical Center, according to Chatham Emergency Services. Ellis Square is a popular spot for both tourists and residents visiting the restaurants, bars and clubs along City Market and Congress Street.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An active-duty U.S. Marine accused in the stabbing death of his wife is in custody and facing a second-degree murder charge. The Honolulu Police Department said Saturday that Bryant Tejeda-Castillo was being held on $1 million bail. Police said he was captured shortly after the Wednesday killing of 27-year-old Dana Alotaibi along a freeway. Police said he was taken to the Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu with what one witness said were several self-inflicted wounds. Alotaibi’s friends said she was pregnant, but police said they are awaiting autopsy results. A police spokesman on Saturday said he didn’t know if Tejeda-Castillo remained at the hospital or had been transferred elsewhere. Tejeda-Castillo was arrested on a warrant of second-degree murder.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will spend $1 million to fight illegal fentanyl use and resulting overdose deaths, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said he will likely recommend additional money in his budget that will be considered by lawmakers early next year. But he said urgent action is needed now for the fentanyl problem that law enforcement officials said can spur property crimes, as well as crimes against individuals. The money will be used for testing equipment to increase the ability of police to find fentanyl. It will also be used for a media campaign to alert Idaho residents to the dangers of fentanyl, a cheap but potent synthetic opioid that has been behind a major increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. It has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, leading to overdose deaths. As little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal. The drug is 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: The National Weather Service confirmed a small tornado touched down in suburban Chicago. Snapped trees and minor damage to roofs in Naperville were reported Saturday, meteorologist Todd Kluber said. The tornado touched down about 5:40 a.m. and was part of thunderstorms that rolled through the Chicago area overnight. Wind gusts reached 58 mph at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Kluber said. Multiple gas leaks in a Naperville commercial building also were reported and about 250 utility customers temporarily lost power, the city said in a release. About a dozen roads were blocked by fallen trees or branches. No injuries were reported.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be in Indianapolis on Monday for the start of the General Assembly’s special session to debate a near-total ban on abortion. Harris’s office confirmed to the Indianapolis Star on Friday the vice president would “meet with state legislators and leaders to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights” on the first day of the special session in a roundtable discussion. Senate Republicans have proposed banning abortions in the state, except in cases of rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or when the fetus has a fatal anomaly. Should it pass, it would make Indiana home to one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Seven other states ban abortion at zero weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Hallie Koenigs, a 4-year-old cancer patient from Riceville, was gifted a pink boat in front of the Make-A-Wish Iowa office in Urbandale. Koenigs loves fishing, and goes on a fishing trip every August with her siblings and parents, Allen and Kacie. The project came together with the help of many community members, including a volunteer who traveled to the upper peninsula of Michigan to pick up the boat, Vision Signs, which provided the custom pink vinyl, and Scheels, which provided Hallie with all the fishing gear she would need.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The Shawnee County Commission accepted RailWorks Track Services’ $129,000 bid to make repairs and improvements to the Gage Park mini-train tracks, ties and culverts damaged by severe thunderstorms. The money will come from the building maintenance fund. Repairs include railroad ties, spikes, rails, ballasts and soil work.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear will miss next month’s Fancy Farm picnic for the second straight year. Beshear said in a social media post Friday that he and his wife, first lady Britainy Beshear, will visit Israel in August. The governor said the trip will conflict with the annual political picnic in western Kentucky, which this year falls on Aug. 6. Democrats are expected to be scarce at this year’s picnic, with Republicans dominating most state and federal offices. U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker is the only Democrat who has committed to attend. Kentucky’s two Republican U.S. senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, have not yet committed to attending the picnic. Paul is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate and will face Booker in the fall. The picnic – also known for its barbecue – draws large crowds and is a rite of passage for statewide candidates in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Teachers of English, math, science and social studies are eligible for a $7,500 hiring bonus in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. The move came as the system continues to struggle to staff schools for the upcoming year. On Thursday, the district reported 233 vacant positions, 110 of which were in the core subject areas, The Advocate reported. “This proposal will give us a competitive edge against neighboring parishes offering similar sign-on bonuses,” Nichola Hall, chief human resources officer, wrote in a memo. Hall said the bonus will go only to teachers hired between May 24 and Aug. 5. To be eligible, in addition to teaching in a core subject, the teachers must have a current teaching license and commit in writing to stay with the school system for three years. The parish School Board on Thursday voted 7-1 in favor of the new hiring bonus. The school system is proposing spending almost $1.1 million for the bonuses, which will cover more than 100 teachers. The funding will come from federal COVID-19 relief money.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine-based sporting goods chain that once had more than 200 stores on the East Coast is shuttering its remaining 35 stores. Olympia Sports confirmed the stores would close by the end of September and that liquidation sales had begun at all locations. Olympia Sports was founded in 1975 by Edward Manganello, who opened his first store at the Maine Mall in South Portland. By 2013, it had 226 locations from Maine to Virginia, the Portland Press Herald reported. Denver-based running and active lifestyle brand JackRabbit bought the company in 2019. JackRabbit, owned by a private equity firm, was sold in December to North Carolina-based Fleet Feet. An email to Fleet Feet on Saturday was not immediately returned.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he won’t support the GOP gubernatorial nominee, Dan Cox, whom he once again described as a “Q-Anon” whack job.” Hogan blamed the Democratic Governors Association and former President Donald Trump for Cox’s victory in Tuesday’s primary over Kelly Schulz, who was a cabinet secretary in Hogan’s administration. The DGA spent large amounts of money on ads that described Cox as “too conservative for Maryland” and highlighted his connections to Trump – ads that might well have bolstered Cox’s appeal to GOP primary voters. Hogan, who appeared Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” said Cox’s victory is “a win for the Democrats” because Cox has no chance of defeating Democratic nominee Wes Moore in November in a state where Democrats have a huge natural advantage. Although Hogan said he won’t vote for Cox, he said he’s unsure if he will vote for Moore.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton is calling for changes in the way the Boston-area public transit system operates after a fire on a train prompted one passenger to jump into a river and others to scramble out of windows. No one was injured Thursday morning when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s inbound Orange Line train caught fire while on a bridge crossing the Mystic River just north of Boston on approach to the Assembly station in Somerville. The fire appears to have been caused by a metal panel on the train’s base that came loose and touched the electrified third rail, the system’s general manager said. Moulton told WCVB-TV on Friday that “it’s a total embarrassment and “we’ve got to change it.” Moulton, a member of the House transportation committee, said he doesn’t want the federal government to have to take over. The 43-year-old train car that caught fire had been inspected less than a month ago, which included an inspection of the panel that came loose, according to the MBTA. After the fire, the same panel on every other in-service Orange Line car was inspected, and no issues were found, the agency said. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The practice of fingerprinting people without probable cause or a warrant is unconstitutional, the Michigan Supreme Court said Friday. The court unanimously said Grand Rapids police violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. “The fingerprinting of each of the plaintiffs in these cases constituted a physical trespass onto a person’s body, a constitutionally protected area,” Justice Richard Bernstein wrote. The incidents involved two Black teenagers in 2011 and 2012, though the American Civil Liberties Union said photos and fingerprints were taken from thousands of people in Grand Rapids. The city has dropped the practice, but defended fingerprinting as a way to determine someone’s identity when they had no identification. Police also took photos.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Xcel Energy has started gathering public input on its plan to build one of the state’s largest transmission line projects in recent years. The utility company has proposed building a 140-mile power line that would run from Becker in the north to Lyon County to the south. The $500 million line would connect several new renewable energy projects. “The purpose of this line is to unlock renewable energy from a very renewable rich jurisdiction – wind and solar both,” said Michael Lamb, Xcel’s senior vice president for transmission. If the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approves the project, Lamb estimated it would be completed by 2027 to 2028. The regulatory, engineering and construction process for a large new power line is lengthy. This week, Xcel started contacting landowners, local governments, environmental groups and others impacted by the power line to get their input before determining the line’s final route.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A park by a central Mississippi reservoir will be named for Bobby Cleveland, a longtime outdoors writer who promoted events there after he retired from journalism. The governing board for the Ross Barnett Reservoir has voted unanimously that Lakeshore Park will become the Bobby Cleveland Park at Lakeshore, the Clarion Ledger reported. “He was a very devoted champion of the reservoir,” general manager John Sigman said of Cleveland. The park is in Rankin County, a few miles northwest of Jackson. Cleveland, 67, died after a traffic accident April 28 as he was leaving the park. His memorial service was held there days later. The Hattiesburg native was well-known in Mississippi for his decades as the outdoors writer for the Clarion Ledger. Cleveland lived near the reservoir and fished in it often. After he left the newspaper in 2012, be became the spokesman for the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, the state agency that manages the reservoir. Sigman said the request to rename the park was presented by the Barnett Reservoir Foundation, an organization for which Cleveland had been secretary.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Community members again are urging the City Council to take action on getting the city to use 100% renewable resources for energy production by 2030. The appeal was made last week during a City Council meeting at which the 2022 Columbia Water and Light Renewable Energy Plan report was accepted following a public hearing. A petition with nearly 3,000 signatures was delivered in May to the council requesting it ramp up renewable energy efforts. Among speakers Monday was Carolyn Amparan of the CoMO 100% by 2030 Coalition and the Sierra Club, who helped deliver the petitions in May. “We keep missing the targets,” Amparan said about renewable energy capacity goals by the city. “We shouldn’t just plan to make exactly 15% or 25%.” Other speakers urged the city to negotiate more renewable energy contracts and get out from its coal-powered plant contracts.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal lawsuit has been filed against the Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligation to provide adequate law enforcement services on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Billings argued the federal government does not provide enough federal law enforcement officers, drug investigators, missing persons investigators or jail space, even though violent crime has increased on the reservation, The Billings Gazette reported. “Public safety on-reservation is severely compromised due to the lack of meaningful BIA law enforcement presence in our communities,” Northern Cheyenne Tribe President Serena Wetherelt said in a statement. The officers also lack of understanding of tribal and federal law, which leads to suspects not being charged or prosecuted, the lawsuit said. Reports of violent crime on the reservation increased 50% from 2019 to 2020 and does not include crimes that went unreported, the lawsuit said. The Interior Department declined Friday to comment about the lawsuit, spokesperson Tyler Cherry said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Attorney General Doug Peterson said he will not file criminal charges against fellow Republican and former state lawmaker Mike Groene over photos the ex-lawmaker surreptitiously took of an aide. There is not enough information from the results of a State Patrol investigation to warrant criminal charges against Groene, a spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said Thursday. Groene, of North Platte, resigned from office earlier this year after acknowledging he photographed his legislative aide in his office without her knowledge. The former staffer, Kristina Konecko, said in a complaint to the Legislature’s Executive Board she discovered the photos on Groene’s laptop, which he had given her to update. She said some of the photos included close-ups of body parts. Groene, a blunt-spoken, often abrasive Republican who clashed with Democratic colleagues, also ended his candidacy to become a University of Nebraska Regent after the scandal came to light.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state posted record job numbers last month that showed several key industries have risen above their pre-pandemic employment levels. The record of 1,452,600 jobs was 3,000 more than the previous peak in February 2020. Nevada added 7,600 jobs last month. The employment numbers were announced Friday by Gov. Steve Sisolak, who said in a statement the state had recovered “all of the jobs that were lost during the COVID pandemic, and doing so in a way that has more Nevadans working in better-paying jobs than before the pandemic.” The Las Vegas Review Journal reported the state’s leisure and hospitality sector, which includes casinos, is still lagging behind at 90.7% of its pre-pandemic peak. But other industries have risen above their previous peaks to pull the rest of the state up. Nevada’s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% but remains one of the worst in the country.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed seven bills into law last week, including a Senate bill designed to require health care facilities to implement and maintain workplace violence prevention programs and establish a health care workplace safety commission, according to his office. Lawmakers began working to create the new requirements after the death of a hospital security guard who was assaulted at work in December 2020. Richard Semo, 64, of Farmington died from injuries sustained in an attack in the parking lot of Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester. The man who attacked him pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in 2021. Sununu held a bill signing Friday outside the hospital. Tim Jones, chief executive officer of Frisbie Memorial Hospital, spoke about Semo. Jones also told the governor that health care workers deal with abuse far too often, and there has been an increase in verbal and physical assaults nationwide during the pandemic, according to the Fosters Daily Democrat. Health facilities that are considered urgent care centers must comply with the new state requirement by July 1, 2024.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices are continuing their summertime slide with double-digit reductions in New Jersey amid a decline in demand and a drop in oil prices. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.51, down 12 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.17 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.41, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.15 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. Analysts said “global economic headwinds” are pushing oil prices down and U.S. drivers “are fueling up less despite this being the height of the traditional summer driving season.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: City commissioners took a step toward saving the lives of unwanted newborns at a recent meeting by voting to install a baby box. The vote was spurred by the case of Alexis Avila, who was caught on surveillance camera in early January throwing her infant – who was tied in a plastic bag – into a dumpster behind a retail shopping mall in near-freezing weather. Dumpster divers found the newborn – six hours later, and still alive. Because of that incident, commissioners approved a resolution in support of installing a surrender safety device at Hobbs Fire Station 1, otherwise known as the “Safe Haven Site,” and authorizing the city to seek funding for the installation and maintenance of the device from the state. Commissioners in February had made amendments to the Hobbs Safe Haven for Infants Act, the Hobbs News-Sun reported. Those changes allowed for the surrendering of infants, 90 days or less in age, to be surrendered via a “safety device” or “baby box” without parental fear of criminal prosecution. According to Hobbs Fire Chief Barry Young, the Safe Haven baby box is a much needed asset for Hobbs and surrounding areas.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester:A man accused of attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during a recent campaign rally told investigators he had been drinking that day and didn’t know who the congressman was, authorities said as the man was arrested on a federal assault charge Saturday. David Jakubonis, 43, made an initial court appearance Saturday before a federal magistrate judge in Rochester on a single count of assaulting a member of Congress with a dangerous weapon. The charge carries a potential maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was ordered held until a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday. Prosecutors said he should remain detained as a flight risk and is dangerous, according to a court filing. Assistant federal public defender Steven Slawinski, representing Jakubonis, said in an email to The Associated Press he planned to ask the judge to release Jakubonis from custody. Jakubonis was arraigned Friday on a separate state charge of attempted assault in the second degree and was released by a local judge. That prompted criticism from Zeldin and other Republicans who held it up as an example of the need to reform New York’s bail laws, something Zeldin has called upon Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to toughen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKenly: The city’s police force has resigned over what it called a hostile work environment. Police Chief Josh Gibson said he and four other officers turned in their two-week notices late Wednesday afternoon, news outlets reported. Gibson said utilities clerk Christy Jones and assistant town manager Sharon Evans also resigned. WRAL reported the police force usually has eight officers, but only had five on the force when the resignations occurred. Gibson, who had been with the department for 21 years, said officers couldn’t perform their duties because of the environment that was created by town manager Justine Jones, who took the job at the beginning of June. In their resignation letters, the employees cited a “hostile,” “toxic” and stressful work environment. Jones declined comment on the resignations. Kenly, with a population of approximately 2,400, is about 45 miles southeast of Raleigh.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has renewed its request to throw out a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that alleged the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The state said in court papers filed Thursday it denies allegations by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe. U.S. District Judge Peter Welte dismissed the state’s argument earlier this month that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. The Republican-controlled Legislature during its special session last fall approved a new map of legislative districts, based on updated census data. The map includes new House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argued the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the nonreservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleged the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. The case could go to trial next year if no resolution is reached, according to court filings.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A project to improve electric power capacity is underway on the city’s south side, near the future site of a Google data center. Known as the Parsons Avenue Transmission Project, the endeavor is aimed at improving electrical service for area residents and upcoming development, according to an American Electric Power Outreach Specialist Brian Recker, who added the project will benefit residents and a “future AEP customer” coming to the area, but he would not name the customer. Two substations, one of them new, will be located just north of a $300 million Google data center being built on a portion of the former Hartman Farm, located on the east of South High Street, south of Rathmell Road, west of Parsons Avenue and north of nearby Scioto Downs. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and employ 20 people.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahoma County’s $260 million bond package is supposed to help fund a new sheriff’s office in addition to a new jail facility, according to the ballot language and information from county officials, but the sale of the current office is on hold because of contract issues. Financing for the new sheriff’s office came through proceeds from the sale of the current building paired with a portion of the recently passed bond package. District 2 Commissioner Brian Maughan said the project won’t affect the ability to finance the new jail because the county will still be able to shift funds around from its general budget once it is able to apply federal COVID-19 relief funds to other projects.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland State University announced a tuition discount for any student from a federally recognized Native American tribe. Starting this fall, students who are members of the country’s nearly 600 federally recognized tribes across the country will receive in-state tuition, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. PSU noted in its announcement that it already offers support for students from Indigenous backgrounds including scholarships, programs and student groups through its Native American Student and Community Center. The discounted tuition will be offered starting this fall term to students who can provide their official tribal residency documentation to PSU. The university does not require any other information to be considered for the discount. The difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is roughly $420 per credit hour or about $19,000 per academic year for students enrolled in 15 credits, according to PSU.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state trooper has been charged with felony animal cruelty after hitting a loose horse with a patrol vehicle multiple times and pinning it to the pavement, where it was then euthanized, authorities said Friday. Cpl. Michael Perillo was suspended without pay after the charges were filed by the state police internal affairs division, officials announced. His bail was set at $50,000 during his arraignment Friday on two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and one count of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor. It is not known whether he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. A message left Friday for the union that represents troopers, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, was not immediately returned. Perillo responded to a call to police Dec. 28 involving a horse on a highway in Chester County, west of Philadelphia. The horse was on the road’s shoulder in Lower Oxford Township and had been struck by a motorist before troopers were sent, authorities said. Perillo drove a vehicle into the horse multiple times, causing it to fall, and then pinned the horse to the road, authorities said. Another trooper then euthanized it. Perillo, who enlisted in the state police in September 2006, is assigned to Troop J in Avondale.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin is naming two politicians who will be leaders on issues affecting Americans with disabilities as he prepares to retire from Congress. Langevin is holding an event Tuesday in Washington to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, speak about the need for accessible transportation and name two new co-chairs of the House Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus. Langevin led the caucus with Republican co-chair and longtime Alaska congressman Don Young, who died in March. Langevin isn’t seeking a 12th term. Langevin, the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, worked to create the caucus shortly after he got to Congress in 2001. Caucus members educate their colleagues and staff on issues affecting Americans with disabilities and their families, and work to ensure access to health care, housing, transportation, employment opportunities and disability benefits. Langevin said he is waiting until the event to announce the names.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The U.S. Senate confirmed Adair Ford Boroughs, a former congressional candidate and Columbia lawyer, to become the top federal prosecutor for South Carolina. The Senate approved the nomination by a voice vote of Ford Boroughs on Thursday as the state’s U.S. attorney. After the vote, Ford Boroughs tweeted, “I’m very excited to return to (the) DOJ and to work with an incredible team at the U.S. Attorney’s office.” President Joe Biden nominated Ford Boroughs, 42, for the position in June. Ford Boroughs’ nomination was quickly advanced by a Senate panel on July 14 with just two members – Missouri Republican Josh Hawley and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn – opposed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The sister of a St. Louis man who died while hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota said he was camping as part of a trip to celebrate graduating from college and got lost trying to find his way back to his car. The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office tweeted that 22-year-old Maxwell Right collapsed on an unmarked trail in Badlands National Park on Wednesday. He and a friend who was traveling with him had run out of water, according to the tweet. Temperatures in the Badlands had been approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the first half of the week. Right’s sister, Lucille, said the National Park Service told the family that her brother died surrounded by rangers. Authorities have not identified his friend, who the sheriff’s office said was flown to a Rapid City hospital and placed under observation for exposure and dehydration. The sheriff’s office initially said in its tweet that the unmarked trail has been featured in a social media challenge, but later said the men were simply following a trail on a hiking app. Lucille Right said her brother and his friend weren’t taking part in any social media challenge, saying they were on a larger trip to celebrate Maxwell graduating from Missouri S&T and had planned to visit Mt. Rushmore on Wednesday night.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Four inmates who escaped from the Silverdale Detention Center have been captured, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. Officers discovered the inmates were missing during a headcount early Saturday in a minimum security housing unit, media outlets reported. The facility was placed on lockdown and officials determined the missing inmates had breached an exterior door and scaled the perimeter barbed wire fence. Two of the inmates, Johnny Bryant and William Atkins, were captured within a few hours at a motel, the sheriff’s office said. Hours after authorities requested the public’s help to locate Justin Lynn Conner and Trevor Lynn Hall, both inmates were taken into custody. Conner was found in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee, and Hall was found in Jackson County, Tennessee. Among the charges that Bryant and Atkins face include resisting arrest and felony escape. Conner faces charges that include possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine for resale/manufacturing, use of stolen plates, theft of property, criminal impersonation, theft of property over $2,500 and misdemeanor evading. Hall faces the following charges: contraband in a penal institution, evading arrest, theft of property and felony escape.\n\nTexas\n\nBig Bend National Park: Authorities said a 75-year-old Houston man died while hiking alone last week at Big Bend National Park. The body of the man was found Thursday about a half-mile from the start of a trail, according to Park Deputy Superintendent David Elkowitz. The man’s name was not immediately released by authorities. Officials were still trying to determine a cause of death but summer heat at the park can be extreme. On Thursday afternoon, temperatures along the trail where the man’s body was found exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials at the national park in west Texas said hikers need to be mindful of the dangers from the extreme heat and they should be prepared to carry and drink one gallon of water per day and should be off desert trails by noon.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A wildfire sparked by lightning near the Utah-Nevada border late Thursday grew to nearly 6,000 acres on Friday, driven by winds and dry conditions into Washington County and sending a plume of smoke over much of the surrounding area. The fire was first reported just before 3 p.m. Thursday, about 25 miles southeast of Caliente, Nev. It burned quickly toward the north and the east on Friday, moving into heavier vegetation in the Docs Pass wilderness area, according to the Eastern Nevada Interagency Fire group. No structures or private property were threatened as of late Friday. More than 150 Firefighters were assigned, along with several fire engines, bulldozers and other equipment, with aerial support from multiple heavy air tankers and a helicopter. The fire was 5% contained as of late Friday afternoon.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 42-year-old Nevada man pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Burlington for his role in helping arrange the kidnapping and murder of a Vermont man stemming from a financial dispute. Aron Lee Ethridge is one of four men who have been charged in the kidnapping of Gregory Davis from his Danville home Jan. 6, 2018. Davis was found shot to death in a snowbank the next day. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors and Ethridge’s defense attorney agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 27 years or less. The actual sentence, scheduled for December, will be up to the judge. Ethridge could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said Ethridge arranged for Jerry Banks, 34, of Fort Garland, Colorado, to kidnap and then kill Davis. Banks allegedly called Ethridge the day after the kidnapping to inform him that Davis had been successfully kidnapped and killed. Banks has only been charged with kidnapping, but prosecutors alleged he killed Davis. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held pending trial.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Bodycam videos, police reports and other materials connected to the city’s aggressive response to protesters in June 2020 have been made public through the Library of Virginia. The database that went live recently is part of a legal settlement between the city and plaintiffs who said police used excessive force against protesters who gathered at the Robert E. Lee statue two years ago in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew. The department later apologized and said the use of tear gas was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned. Thomas H. Roberts, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs, said the archive will allow the public to judge for themselves how police responded. Members of the public will be able to contribute their own footage of what occurred to the archive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Authorities on Sunday issued an excessive heat watch for the Pacific Northwest region for coming days as potential record-breaking temperatures were forecast to settle in and linger until next weekend. Temperatures could break daily records in Seattle and other areas by Tuesday, potentially reaching their highest levels since last year’s heat wave that killed hundreds of people across the Pacific Northwest. Highs ranging from 95 to 110 were forecast for inland areas. An excessive heat watch was issued for central and eastern Washington state and the central Idaho Panhandle from Tuesday morning through Friday night.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office will be closed for sanitation Monday through Wednesday after staff tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Friday. The Vital Registration Office is the state’s official repository of birth, death, marriage and divorce records. The state plans to reopen the Charleston office on Thursday, a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources spokesperson said in a news release. Meanwhile, residents can go to their county clerk’s office to access certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, state officials said. Records can also be requested by mail or online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, the leader of the Assembly elections committee, is calling for her colleagues to decertify President Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020, a move that prompted her counterpart in the Senate to call for her removal. Brandtjen, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year, said Friday she was joining Republican candidate for governor Tim Ramthun’s push to overturn the last presidential election because “tyranny is at Wisconsin’s door.” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington has rejected such calls to do so. A spokeswoman for Vos did not answer whether Brandtjen, whom he appointed as chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, should continue to lead the panel. Sen. Kathy Bernier, R-Chippewa Falls, the chair of the Senate’s elections committee, said Brandtjen should be removed or step down from the committee. Bernier said the continued focus on 2020 through such claims hurts voter confidence needlessly.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Most abortions will become illegal in Wyoming on Wednesday after Gov. Mark Gordon gave the go-ahead Friday under a new state law. The law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. The Wyoming Legislature approved the ban and Gordon signed it into law in March in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade. That happened June 24, kicking off a review by Attorney General Bridget Hill to make sure Wyoming’s law conforms to the Supreme Court ruling. Gordon certified the law to the Secretary of State’s Office after Hill completed her almost four-week review Thursday. “I believe that the decision to regulate abortion is properly left to the states,” Gordon said in a statement. “As a pro-life governor, my focus will continue to be on ensuring we are doing all we can to support Wyoming mothers, children and families.” Wyoming currently allows abortions until a fetus can survive outside its mother’s body, generally around 23 weeks. Wyoming has no abortion clinics but the procedure still occurs in other medical settings, with 98 in the state reported to the Wyoming Department of Health in 2021, up from 91 in 2020. The abortion ban will have an “immediate and devastating” effect on those in Wyoming who can become pregnant, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. Organizers of a planned women’s health and abortion clinic in Casper have said they might contest the state abortion ban in court. An arson attack in May delayed the clinic’s expected mid-June opening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building. People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/12/fearless-girl-lizard-invasion-superman-building-news-around-states/50062795/", "title": "Fearless Girl, lizard invasion: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Two families with transgender teens and two physicians sued the state Monday to overturn a law that makes it a crime for doctors to treat trans youth under 19 with puberty blockers or hormones to help affirm their gender identity. The lawsuit was filed in federal court three days after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the measure into law. Ivey is running for reelection this year and faces challengers in next month’s GOP primary. “By signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “She has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.” The parents of a 13-year-old transgender girl in Jefferson County and a 17-year-old transgender boy in Shelby County are participating in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are known as Roe and Doe in the court filing to protect the children’s identities. The Southern Poverty Law Center; the Human Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for the LGBTQ community; and other groups are representing the plaintiffs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is not on track to finish its work within a voter-approved session limit. The 90-day mark will be reached Sunday. The voter-approved limit took effect in 2008, but lawmakers face no penalty for failing to meet the deadline and can continue working beyond it. The state constitution permits regular sessions of up to 121 days, with an option to extend another 10 days. Lawmakers last finished within the 90-day limit in 2013, according to statistics from the Legislative Affairs Agency. The state House over the weekend passed its version of a state operating budget, which the Senate still must consider. Senate President Peter Micciche did not have an immediate update on when the operating budget would reach the Senate floor. Differences between the versions that pass the House and Senate usually are worked out by a conference committee. The House version called for a $1,300 “energy relief” payment to Alaskans and a dividend of about $1,250. A long-standing formula for calculating the annual dividend was last used in 2015. While many lawmakers see that formula as unsustainable, agreement has yet to be reached on an alternative. The dividend amount in the meantime generally has been set by lawmakers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state House voted Monday to delay the effective date for legislation signed last month requiring voters to provide evidence of their citizenship, which has already prompted two lawsuits amid fears by voting rights advocates that it could cancel the registrations of thousands of people. If approved by the Senate and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the citizenship requirement would take effect after the 2022 election, a concession demanded by a GOP lawmaker who provided the final vote to pass the bill out of the Senate. As it stands now, that requirement and others in a bill signed March 30 will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, which is likely to fall between the primary and general election. Monday’s update also would make a technical change that appears aimed at addressing concerns the bill could require hundreds of thousands of people who registered before 2005 to provide proof of citizenship. Arizona is the only state that requires documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A 2013 Supreme Court decision on Arizona’s law said anyone who registers using a federal voter registration form, which does not require documentation of citizenship, must be allowed to vote in federal elections. The controversial new law seeks to block those voters from voting for president or by mail.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A medical marijuana producer is opening a retail location in the city’s suburbs. Good Day Farm, which has operations across the South, on Tuesday unveiled Berner’s By Good Day Farm. Occupying 4,034 square feet of prime retail space in the Little Rock suburb of Chenal, the retail collaboration marks the Cookies brand’s entry into the Arkansas medical cannabis market and will provide the state’s patients with an expanded assortment of curated cannabis products and exclusive merchandise. “I never imagined our first store in the South being in Arkansas; I actually never pictured opening a store in the South in general,” said Berner, founder and CEO of Cookies, who goes by one name. “We are extremely excited about our partnership with Good Day Farm and look forward to providing real menus and a curated customer journey for those in Arkansas, especially those who have never experienced cannabis before. The last time I was in Little Rock, I was on a tour with Snoop (Dogg), and we had a blast. I look forward to setting the tone with Good Day Farm and giving Arkansas a taste of California.” A grand opening event will be held Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A judge has ordered the Southern California city to throw out approval of a long-planned housing project, ruling that developers hadn’t adequately considered how new homes could affect potential wildfire evacuations. The Santee City Council in late 2020 approved the Fanita Ranch project, giving the green light to 3,000 new homes in hills northeast of San Diego. In her decision, Superior Court Judge Katherine Bacal wrote that eight resolutions and ordinances giving approval must be overturned, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The newspaper said the judge expressed concern that the plan didn’t fully address whether thousands of new residents would have time to flee during an emergency like a wildfire. The project, overseen by HomeFed Fanita Rancho, is not dead, and developers said they would revise the environmental impact report to address the judge’s concerns. Messages left by the Union-Tribune with the city’s manager and attorney were not immediately returned. The decision was celebrated by environmental groups that sued to stop the project, arguing that building more homes would only increase the risk of fire.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An advisory board has begun the process of removing the disparaging word “squaw” from 28 of the state’s peaks, valleys, passes and creeks. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board met for three hours Sunday and considered task force recommendations and suggestions from local communities, The Colorado Sun reports. The board approved new names for nearly two dozen features but deferred a handful of name changes to a federal task force and steered clear of suggestions for naming features after people. The board also said all of its recommendations should take a back seat if Indigenous tribes suggest a better replacement. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, it morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in November created a committee to strip the name from federal maps. The Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force in February identified 660 features on federal land with the name, including 28 in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in the state to request medication to help them die was suddenly derailed Monday by an unusual parliamentary procedure during a committee vote. Advocates had expressed optimism this would finally be the year, after roughly a decade of emotional debate, the legislation would get a vote in the full House of Representatives and Senate and be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. However, Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the top House member on the General Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, made a motion to “divide the committee.” That meant only senators on the panel could vote on the legislation. In Connecticut, both House and Senate members comprise committees. Ultimately, the senators defeated the bill on a 5-4 vote. Democratic Sen. Mae Flexer of Windham voted with the four Republicans in opposing the measure. “It says a lot about support for medical aid in dying, both inside and outside the Capitol, that opponents had to resort to a rarely used parliamentary maneuver to defeat the legislation,” said Tim Appleton, campaign director for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices, arguing there’s strong support among Connecticut residents for the bill. He predicted the vote will mean “immeasurable suffering” for people who are already terminally ill.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A high-ranking state medical official who is also a former legislator has opted for a bench trial instead of a jury trial on charges of official misconduct and falsifying business records. The trial of Rebecca D. Walker began Tuesday afternoon in New Castle County Superior Court. Walker is the director of nursing in the state Division of Public Health and a former state House representative. She is accused of submitting phony records regarding employee alcohol and drug testing over a period of almost five years while she served as deputy director of the state Division of Forensic Science. Walker was placed on paid administrative leave from her nursing post after being indicted in April 2021 but was allowed to return to work less than three weeks later. As Democratic vice-chair of the House Health and Human Development, Walker co-sponsored and helped pass a bill in 2014 that created the forensic science division. Months later, without a public job posting, she was hired as deputy director of the division at a salary of more than $92,000. The indictment alleges that between May 2015 and February 2020, Walker, “with the intent to defraud,” falsified employee substance abuse testing records, indicating that employees had passed tests they never received.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission saying it found evidence the NFL’s Washington Commanders engaged in unlawful financial conduct. In the letter obtained by the Associated Press, the committee said the team withheld ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable ticket deposits from season ticketholders. The committee said emails, documents and statements made by former employees indicate team executives and owner Dan Snyder engaged in “a troubling, long-running, and potentially unlawful pattern of financial conduct.” The committee is sharing documents with the FTC while requesting the commission take any action necessary to make sure the money is returned to its rightful owners. Congress launched an investigation into the team’s workplace misconduct after the league did not release a report detailing the findings of an independent probe into the matter. After testimony from former employees, that investigation expanded to the organization’s finances. Lawyers Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent more than 40 former employees, including some who testified, called the letter “damning.” “It’s clear that the team’s misconduct goes well beyond the sexual harassment and abuse of employees already documented,” they said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will create new grant programs to help fathers become more engaged with their own children and with children whose fathers aren’t in their homes under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday. The Department of Children and Families will manage the grant program and work with nonprofit organizations to promote the importance of fathers being a part of their children’s lives. It will also create a mentor program to help children who don’t have a father in their lives. “This has huge ramifications for someone’s ability to be able to realize their God-given potential,” DeSantis said. “Any dad who may not be engaged, we want to be able to support. We’ve got programs, we’ve got community groups, we’ve got nonprofits. … You’re not a man by leaving your kids hung out to dry. You need to be there.” DeSantis signed the bill at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice facility and was joined by former coach Tony Dungy.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: The state’s wildlife agency is asking residents to report sightings of an invasive lizard that can pose a threat to native species. The state Department of Natural Resources is trying to locate and remove South American tegus from Georgia before the lizards can thrive in greater numbers. So far, the state’s only known wild population has been found in Toombs and Tattnall counties in southeast Georgia. Wildlife officials hope to stop the black-and-white lizards from spreading further. They can grow up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 pounds, and the reptiles have a wide-ranging appetite that favors eggs of turtles, alligators and ground-nesting birds. “They can live almost anywhere and eat almost anything,” Daniel Sollenberger, a DNR wildlife biologist, said in a news release. “We are focusing our efforts to accomplish two goals: document the extent of where tegus occur in the wilds of southeast Georgia and remove those animals as soon as we can after they are detected.” Officials aren’t sure how tegus got introduced into the wild in Georgia, but they are commonly kept as pets. Last year the DNR removed a single tegu that was spotted on a game camera and later captured in a trap. Seven were collected in 2020. Wildlife officials warn if tegus become established in the wild, they will be nearly impossible to eradicate.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor said Monday that he is not currently considering reinstating a mask requirement for public indoor spaces. Hawaii was the last state in the nation to lift its indoor mask mandate at the end of March. “I don’t anticipate reinstating the mask mandate at this point,” said Ige in an email. The state has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases since the rules were lifted. “We did expect a slight increase in case numbers after spring break, and we have seen that in the last week or so,” Ige said. “However, we are not seeing the kind of surges that are currently happening on the mainland. Hospitalizations continue to be low here, and we are in a good place.” Philadelphia reinstated its mask mandate Monday amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, and other cities across the country are seeing a rise in cases. Ige said if the conditions warranted it, he might consider requiring masks again in the future. “If there is a big spike, we may have to revisit masks,” he said. “However, I noticed over the weekend that many people continue to wear their masks indoors. We know that masks work, and they make a difference in keeping our communities safe.” Public schools in Hawaii still require children to wear masks indoors, a measure the governor said he continues to support.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge ruled Monday that a mother accused of conspiring to kill her children, her estranged husband and a lover’s wife is now mentally competent to stand trial on some of the charges in Idaho. Daybell and her new husband, Chad Daybell, face numerous charges in the complicated case involving allegations of bizarre spiritual beliefs involving “zombies” and doomsday predictions. Prosecutors have said Lori and Chad Daybell espoused the religious beliefs in an effort to encourage or justify the murders. The case against her had been hold for months after Judge Steven Boyce ordered her committed to a mental facility so she could undergo treatment in an effort to make her mentally fit enough to assist in her own defense. Boyce’s new order said Lori Vallow Daybell “is restored to competency and is fit to proceed” in the Idaho murder case. He did not provide other details about her treatment or mental condition. She is scheduled to be formally arraigned in court next week, and both Lori and Chad Daybell are set to stand trial together early next year. They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Lori Daybell’s children, 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Chad Daybell’s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A convicted felon who pleaded guilty to charges that he opened fire on police in 2020, wounding three officers, was sentenced Monday to 31 years in prison. The sentence comes two months after Lovelle Jordan, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder and five counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer, the Chicago Tribune reports. The charges stem from a July 2020 shooting that came shortly after Jordan was arrested in connection with a carjacking in downtown Chicago. Police had driven him to a station on the city’s Northwest Side. Officers patted him down, but while they found he was carrying drugs in his pockets, according to authorities, they did not see that he was carrying a small loaded pistol. Jordan was handcuffed behind his back. At the time of the shooting, Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said that officers had searched Jordan before he was transported, but he apparently had the gun “extremely secreted, probably very close to his private area” and was able to retrieve the weapon during the ride to the station. Jordan was somehow able to move his cuffed hands from behind his back, grabbed the gun and opened fire when an officer opened the door for him at the station. Dozens of shots were fired in a shootout between Jordan and three officers were shot. Jordan was also shot and was left paralyzed.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: State officials have chosen the preferred route of a proposed highway that would run from the Ohio River to Interstate 69, linking small southern Indiana communities to I-69. The Indiana Department of Transportation announced its selection of the “Alternative P” route over several other options for the Mid-States Corridor in a public notice published Monday. The route would start in Spencer County and use existing U.S. 231 until it links with Interstate 64. A new, 54-mile portion of the road would then branch off and run parallel to U.S. 231 before linking with I-69 just north of the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center in Martin County. That route would mostly bypass “developed” parts of towns along the path, including Jasper and Loogootee, the notice said. Mid-States Corridor Project spokeswoman Mindy Peterson declined to provide specifics – including why INDOT chose “alternative P” – until an environmental impact statement is released Friday. Public hearings on the preferred route are set for April 26 at WestGate Academy in Odon and April 28 at the Jasper Arts Center on Vincennes University’s Jasper campus. INDOT and the project’s supporters say it will improve southern Indiana’s highway connections. Opponents have argued that building a new highway would damage the region’s forests and caves.\n\nIowa\n\nOxford: Iowa Farm Sanctuary has become the first in the state to be accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, joining the ranks of more than 150 GFAS-accredited and -verified sanctuaries, rescues and rehabilitation centers worldwide. “It’s a huge accomplishment, and there’s so much buildup to it. We were confident that we are accreditation-worthy, but it was just all the work that we put into it,” said Katie Valentine, assistant director of operations at the Iowa Farm Sanctuary. The Iowa Farm Sanctuary was founded by Shawn and Jered Camp in 2016. The nonprofit focuses on helping animals with special needs like Ellie, a cow who was born blind. Not all residents at the farm sanctuary have special needs. Many come from dangerous situations, like Kathy the goat, rescued from a hoarder. Accreditation from GFAS vouches for organizations with stakeholders such as donors or a foundation. An organization must meet the GFAS Standards of Excellence, which contain guidelines for housing, veterinary care, well-being and handling, financial stability and more. “In Iowa, which is a state known for having a lot of animal agriculture, Iowa Farm Sanctuary really stands out because unlike (in animal agriculture), they are providing individualized care to their residents,” said Jessica Harris, program director of farmed animals at GFAS.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday signed a bill pushed by Republicans to overturn three communities’ policies that could help immigrants stay in the state illegally. The bill was filed after Wyandotte County passed a “sanctuary” ordinance in February that would provide local identification cards for immigrants and other residents and would prevent local law enforcement from helping the federal government enforce immigration laws unless public safety is threatened. Lawrence and Roeland Park have similar ordinances. The Democratic governor said in a statement announcing that she would sign the bill that immigration policy is a federal responsibility and can’t be resolved at the local level. “Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have failed to address immigration issues for decades,” Kelly said. “We need a national solution, and we need it now.” The Kansas House and Senate passed the bill in recent weeks, and supporters had the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override a Kelly veto. The bill nullifies the three existing ordinances and bans future ones that restrict cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill also says a local ID isn’t valid for voting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill allowing lawyers to carry concealed weapons anywhere in the state, including courtrooms, drew a veto Monday from Gov. Andy Beshear, who said it could spark dangerous situations. The Democratic governor said he was contacted by judges, prosecutors and the state Fraternal Order of Police requesting that he veto the measure. The proposal was attached as an amendment to an unrelated bill by the Senate before it cleared the Republican-led Legislature in the final hectic days before lawmakers took their “veto period’” break to allow Beshear to review stacks of passed bills. The gun-carrying allowance would apply to lawyers arguing cases as well as attorneys personally involved in cases, including domestic disputes or divorces, Beshear’s veto message said. The bill is one of a raft of measures vetoed recently by the governor. Lawmakers will be able to take up veto override efforts when they reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session. The governor said he supports Second Amendment rights to bear arms, but his veto message raised potentially dangerous scenarios in courtrooms if the measure becomes law. “Courtrooms are venues of often volatile disputes that can be filled with emotion and tension,” wrote Beshear, a former state attorney general.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The group Red Hot Chili Peppers has been added to the lineup of the 2022 New Orleans Jazz Fest. The rock band’s appearance is set for Sunday, May 1, and will be its first at the event since 2016. The group has sold 80 million albums, collected six Grammy Awards and been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their 12th studio album, “Unlimited Love,” was released April 1. Last month, the festival announced plans to find a replacement for the Foo Fighters, which canceled all upcoming concert dates after the death of the band’s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. Their scheduled time slot has now been filled by the Chili Peppers. The 2022 festival will run April 29-May 1 and May 5-8 at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. The Who, Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Luke Combs, Willie Nelson, Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, Charlie Wilson and Erykah Badu are among the headliners for this year’s festival. Started in 1970, Jazz Fest annually celebrates the unique culture and heritage of New Orleans and Louisiana, alongside performances by nationally and internationally renowned guest artists. It is returning after a two-year hiatus brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lawyer for the former mayor made the case in court Tuesday that his client was served an eviction notice in retaliation for organizing on behalf of tenants. Ethan Strimling, the mayor of Portland from 2015 to 2019, appeared in court after he was served with the eviction notice last year and refused to leave. Strimling’s case has gone to court because his landlord, Geoffrey Rice, started legal proceedings to make him leave. Strimling’s attorney, Scott Dolan, said during opening statements in the case that the eviction was “a clear case of retaliation” for organizing the tenants’ union, the Bangor Daily News reports. Rice’s attorney, David Chamberlain, said during his own opening statement that the eviction was about economics. Rice offered an example that Strimling violated a section of his lease by leaving his window open in April. That presented a potential cost for Rice, who paid the heating bill. Portland voters passed a rent control ordinance in November 2020. That ordinance encouraged residents to organize.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A former police detective was found guilty of several federal crimes Monday, including providing a gun that he knew would be planted on a suspect. A federal jury convicted Robert Hankard of corruption and conspiracy charges, including allegations that he conspired with others to plant a BB gun on a suspect whom another officer had run over and later lied about it to a grand jury, news outlets reports. Hankard was also convicted of falsifying an application for a search warrant and an arrest report in another incident where drugs were planted on a suspect and of falsely testifying to a federal grand jury. The prosecution was part of the fallout from the rogue Gun Trace Task Force, which was supposed to take illegal guns off the streets, but instead members robbed drug dealers, planted drugs and guns on innocent people, and assaulted seemingly random civilians. Hankard didn’t testify and remains out of custody until his sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill passed by the state Senate aims to assist members of communities disproportionately harmed by the enforcement of past marijuana laws in participating in the growing cannabis market. The legislation would create a new fund that supporters say will increase equity in the cannabis industry in part by addressing the lack of access to capital that has kept many would-be entrepreneurs from taking part in the new industry. Opening an average cannabis retail shop can require more than $1 million, backers of the legislation said, with the numbers even higher for manufacturing facilities – as much as $5 million. Another hurdle is federal cannabis law preventing businesses from accessing traditional bank loans, leaving many entrepreneurs vulnerable to predatory financial deals and damaging equity partnerships. The bill would create a social equity fund to facilitate new access to capital by making grants and loans, including forgivable and no-interest loans. The fund would receive 10% of annual revenue collected from the marijuana excise tax, an estimated $18 million for the 2023 fiscal year. If approved, the state would join a handful of other states in pioneering the program. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: PFAS compounds, the emerging contaminant “forever chemicals” raising public health and environmental alarms, are found in greater quantities in the treated water leaving the state’s wastewater treatment plants – the water returning to streams, rivers and lakes – than in the not-yet-treated water entering the plant, a new Western Michigan University study found. The study highlights the complex cycling of PFAS, which have been tied to cancer and other health problems, through the environment and through human attempts to address it. When PFAS are removed from a contaminated site – either physically excavated or through charcoal filtration – the removed contaminants typically end up in a landfill. When that landfill leaches liquids, they are typically captured and either piped or trucked to a wastewater treatment facility. But such facilities aren’t required to treat for PFAS. The increase in PFAS detection in wastewater treatment plant’s outflow doesn’t mean the plants are introducing more chemicals. Rather, it appears that PFAS chemicals that scientists cannot readily detect in the wastewater entering plants are being transformed into detectable PFAS compounds during the treatment process, said Matt Reeves, lead author of the study, hydrogeologist and associate professor at Western Michigan, who specializes in the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors revealed in a hearing Monday evening that they offered plea deals to three former police officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of George Floyd, but the defendants rejected them. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill held the hearing mostly to consider whether he has the authority to allow live video coverage of the upcoming trial set to begin in June for former Officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. They’re charged with aiding and abetting both manslaughter and murder when former Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement for 91/ 2 minutes on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back. Lead prosecutor Matthew Frank did not disclose details of the plea offers in open court but said they were identical and were made March 22 after a jury convicted the three in a separate trial in February on federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd’s death, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still don’t know what their federal sentences will be. The judge in that case has not set a sentencing date, and all three remain free on bail.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A death row inmate has told a judge under oath that he wants to continue appealing his case, months after saying he wanted to give up his appeals and request an execution date. George County Circuit Court Judge Kathy King Jackson issued an order Monday noting the current wishes of the inmate, Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, who appeared before Jackson on Thursday and said he wants to continue his appeal in federal court. Grayson, 46, was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County. He said in a handwritten letter to the state Supreme Court in early December: “I ask to see that my execution should be carried out forthwith.” Grayson also said then that he wanted to end all of his appeals. Grayson’s attorney, David Voisin, submitted a letter days later asking justices to disregard Grayson’s request because Grayson still had an appeal pending in federal court. On Jan. 28, the state Supreme Court ordered that Grayson be put under oath before a circuit judge to say whether he wished to go forward with his request for the state to schedule his lethal injection. That hearing happened Thursday.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledges mistakes in her handling of the prosecution of former Gov. Eric Greitens but won’t face severe penalties for those mistakes. The “joint stipulation” agreement was announced Monday at the outset of a disciplinary hearing before a three-person panel. In the agreement, Gardner concedes she failed to produce documents and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers in the 2018 criminal case. The agreement says Gardner’s conduct “was negligent or perhaps reckless, but not intentional.” It calls for a written reprimand. A more severe punishment – suspension or disbarment – would likely cost Gardner her job because state law requires elected prosecutors to hold active law licenses. The panel would still need to sign off on the agreement and make a recommendation within 30 days to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ultimately decides punishment. It’s unclear when the court might make a final decision. Gardner is St. Louis’ first Black female circuit attorney and one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. She told the panel Monday that the mistakes were due to the fast-moving nature of the Greitens case.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental officials unlawfully approved a large copper mine in central Montana despite worries that mining waste would pollute a river that’s popular among boaters, a state judge ruled. Officials with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality failed to conduct an adequate review of the proposed Black Butte mine north of White Sulphur Springs, Judge Katherine Bidegaray said in Friday’s ruling. Work began last year on the mine along a tributary of the Smith River, a waterway so popular among boaters that the state holds an annual lottery to decide who can float down it. The underground mine sponsored by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. Environmentalists had sued over potential pollution from the mine and asked Bidegaray to reconsider its permit. Her ruling leaves that permit in place for now. She asked the two sides in the case to submit legal briefs within 45 days to address what should happen next. State officials said the mine permit includes requirements that will protect the Smith River. They plan to appeal the ruling, Department of Environmental Quality Director Chris Dorrington said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bill that would have allowed people in a majority of U.S. states to carry concealed handguns without a permit died Monday when Nebraska lawmakers derailed the proposal after hearing concerns from law enforcement officials. The bill would have made Nebraska the 26th state to adopt so-called constitutional carry legislation. Supporters in Nebraska fell two votes short of the 33-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster led by opponents, which prevents lawmakers from advancing it this year. Permitless concealed carry is already allowed in 25 conservative-leaning states. The Nebraska bill won initial approval last month but stalled Monday on the second of three required votes in the waning days of the legislative session. “To say I’m frustrated is an understatement,” said Sen. Tom Brewer, the bill’s sponsor and a leading gun rights advocate in the Legislature. Nebraska already allows gun owners to carry firearms in public view, as long as they aren’t in a place where it’s prohibited and don’t have a criminal record that bars them from possessing one. To legally conceal the gun, they’re required to submit to a Nebraska State Patrol background check, get fingerprinted and take a gun safety course at their own expense.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More Nevadans today are pessimistic about financial security and rising inflation than in recent years, a new poll of likely voters found, suggesting a negative shift in public opinion on the Silver State’s economy. The poll conducted last week by Suffolk University for the Reno Gazette Journal shows that Nevadans’ outlook on the economy mirrors how they feel about their elected officials both at the state level and in the White House. Just over 40% said their standard of living is worse now than it was four years ago – before Gov. Steve Sisolak and President Joe Biden assumed their respective offices and replaced Republican incumbents. About half said Nevada is headed down the wrong track. Suffolk surveyed 500 voters across the state, all of whom indicated they will likely vote in the midterm elections later this year. About 43% said their annual household income is less than $75,000, with 13% making less than $20,000 annually. Nevada’s median household income in 2020 was about $62,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing as president, and 47% said they want their vote in November “to change the direction” Biden is leading the nation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A commission to address domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking will meet again following a ten-year absence, according to an executive order signed Monday by Gov. Chris Sununu. A state task force that examined how the judiciary handles domestic violence cases recommended that the commission be brought back. The original commission was created by Gov. Stephen Merrill and was active from 1993 to 2013. Sununu’s executive order said the state “remains committed to fostering a multidisciplinary approach to both better address the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and promote a consistent response to hold offenders accountable for their actions.” It said that combatting and preventing domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking “remains a priority” for Sununu’s administration, and a commitment to reconvene the commission “is an additional measure to ensure victims remain safe and offenders are held accountable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNorth Haledon: Hundreds of people are signing petitions to keep a 25-foot star shining at High Mountain Park Preserve as the mayor continues to defy an order to take down the solar-powered decoration. Mayor Randy George said Monday that he is prepared to reinforce the public relations onslaught at a special meeting next month at Eastern Christian High School. The agenda, he said, will be to organize more support against The Nature Conservancy, the Virginia-based nonprofit that asked for the star to be permanently removed. “I’m doing everything I can to harass them,” the mayor said. Meanwhile, the borough has backing from an influential source. The township of Wayne is helping the cause, and its mayor said he “does not object” to the star on the mountain. Wayne owns most of the 1,260-acre park, but according to the conservancy, it does not own any portion of the preserve where the star is placed. That part was given directly to the nonprofit by North Haledon in October 2000. Barbara Brummer, the conservancy’s director for New Jersey, wrote in a letter to George that the star is a safety hazard because hikers are climbing on it and visiting the mountain after dark to see it lit up. “Another very important consideration,” she wrote, “is that the star and its accompanying equipment have a negative ecological impact.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election regulators are resisting efforts by a conservative-backed foundation to post statewide voter registration information on a public website where it can be searched by names or addresses to view whether people voted in past elections and sometimes their party affiliations. The website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation, created by Republican former U.S. Senate candidate Doug Truax of Illinois, announced in December that it would add registered New Mexico voters to its website database VoteRef.com that was established in the wake of the 2020 election and now includes voter rolls from at least 20 states. That move has prompted calls for a state investigation into possible misuse of election records and a preemptive lawsuit by Voter Reference Foundation to ensure its plans to publish the details about New Mexico voters. The foundation has said its goal is to usher in a “new era of American election transparency.” But New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in an interview Monday that the foundation’s efforts violate state law that restricts the use of voter registration data to political campaigning or noncommercial government purposes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The 4-foot bronze Fearless Girl statue that was deposited in front of Lower Manhattan’s Charging Bull in 2017 will remain in its current spot opposite the New York Stock Exchange at least until early next year while city officials wrestle with a permanent disposition for the popular symbol of female empowerment, a city board decided Monday. Members of the Public Design Commission granted an 11-month permit extension and said they would spend the next six months exploring a way for New York City to take ownership of the statue, which is currently the subject of litigation between artist Kristen Visbal and State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based asset-management firm that commissioned it. “We today, the Public Design Commission, cannot make this a permanent piece of art,” commission president Signe Nielsen said. “We can urge that steps be taken to enable this work to be considered for the public collection.” The statue of a spunky young girl was supposed to be a temporary installation when State Street commissioned it in 2017 to urge higher representation of women on corporate boards, but permits to keep it on display were extended several times once it became a major tourist attraction. Fearless Girl was moved to its current location in December 2018 and has continued to draw selfie-taking visitors. Visbal, meanwhile, began selling replicas of the statue around the world. State Street, which had an ownership contract with the artist, sued Visbal, alleging the replica sales violated the agreement, and Visbal countersued, arguing that the company was infringing on her rights. She has urged the city to take ownership of the piece itself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former firefighter who said she had endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed Tuesday that his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. He said it was unusual for a gender discrimination case to survive summary judgment. “The city didn’t come forward with settlement offers until that happened,” he said. A federal judge ruled in March that the discrimination lawsuit filed by Ponder, one of the highest-ranking women in a North Carolina fire department, could proceed based on a claim of “disparate treatment.” Attorneys for the city of Asheville and Fire Chief Scott Burnette had asked U.S. District Court Judge Martin Reidinger for a pretrial summary judgment throwing out all claims by Ponder. Reidinger dismissed claims against Burnette, writing in his order that he could not be held responsible under the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s Title VII against employment discrimination because the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said “supervisors are not liable in their individual capacities for Title VII violations.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana in the state submitted paperwork Monday to begin the approval process. If it’s approved by North Dakota’s secretary of state, the group would need to gather 15,582 signatures by July 11 to get the measure on the ballot for the general election in November. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use limited amounts of marijuana and purchase products from registered establishments in North Dakota. The measure would put policies in place to regulate retail stores, cultivators, and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s signature-gathering. Cannabis was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: From X-ray body scanners to anti-drone technology, the state is ramping up efforts to keep contraband out of prisons as drugs and other illicit goods flood inside – even when visitation was curbed during the pandemic. The anti-contraband measures are aimed at anyone who enters prisons, whether inmates returning from an outside assignment, visitors or staff members, said Annette Chambers-Smith, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. “Every time we solve one thing, we have to build a better mousetrap for the next thing,” Chambers-Smith told the Associated Press. The scope of the problem was underscored last month when federal authorities announced the arrest of a South African woman on suspicion of helping to smuggle hundreds of sheets of drug-soaked paper into at least five Ohio prisons. The woman is accused of soaking papers in legal correspondence, which is exempt from normal inspection routines. The state said it conducted about 1,000 drug seizures a month in state prisons from March through September 2020. Numbers slowly decreased through 2021 and now average just under 500 a month, according to state data.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law Tuesday that makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill, which takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns next month, makes an exception only for an abortion performed to save the life of the mother. Abortion rights advocates say the bill signed by the GOP governor is certain to face a legal challenge. “We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said during a signing ceremony for the bill, flanked by anti-abortion lawmakers, clergy and students. “I promised Oklahomans that I would sign every pro-life bill that hits my desk, and that’s what we’re doing here today.” Under the bill, anyone convicted of performing an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The measure does not authorize criminal charges against a woman for receiving an abortion. Sen. Nathan Dahm, a Broken Arrow Republican now running for Congress who wrote the bill, called it the “strongest pro-life legislation in the country right now, which effectively eliminates abortion in Oklahoma.” There is no enforcement mechanism for women who order abortion medication online from out-of-state suppliers. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill last year to prevent such online purchases, but that measure was blocked by the state Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A recently released report shows an ice storm in 2021 decimated hundreds of acres of trees in the city. The report from Salem Public Works Department says a citywide analysis found a 17.6% tree canopy loss from August 2020 to May 2021. City staff said about 10 acres of tree canopy was lost to development, but the bulk of the loss – more than 1,000 acres – was because of the Feb. 15, 2021, ice storm. The report to the city says thousands of trees fell, and branches buckled under the weight of ice during the storm. Historic and heritage trees, some hundreds of years old, were downed. “Large Oregon white oaks were particularly hard hit by the ice storm as their large diameter branches accumulated heavy loads of ice, resulting in massive limb breakage and whole trees keeling over,” city staff said in the report. Initial reviews found about 10,000 trees were damaged, and 1,000 trees were removed from city property following the storm. The city spent more than $6.3 million on ice storm-related cleanup. New tree growth and new planting projects have helped offset that loss, the city said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Ex-President Donald Trump slammed GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill McSwain on Tuesday, complaining the former federal prosecutor did “absolutely nothing” to investigate Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud after Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020. McSwain, who spent nearly three years as the top federal prosecutor in Philadelphia under Trump, had been seeking his endorsement, calling the presidential election in Pennsylvania a “partisan disgrace” as he sought to curry favor with the former president. McSwain has often touted his connection to Trump while campaigning for the GOP nod in a crowded primary field. Instead, Trump turned on him. “One person in Pennsylvania who I will not be endorsing is Bill McSwain for Governor. He was the U.S. Attorney who did absolutely nothing on the massive Election Fraud that took place in Philadelphia and throughout the commonwealth,” Trump said in a statement. “Do not vote for Bill McSwain, a coward, who let our Country down. He knew what was happening and let it go.” Trump’s false claims of a stolen election have been debunked by the courts, his own Justice Department and numerous recounts, and no prosecutor, judge or election official in Pennsylvania has raised a concern about widespread fraud.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: After years of neglect, the most recognizable feature on the city’s skyline, the Superman Building, will be rescued. Gov. Dan McKee announced Tuesday that the building’s owner is planning to turn the vacant landmark into an apartment building with offices and shops, with help from state and city funding. Officially known as the Industrial Trust Building, at roughly 430 feet high, it is the tallest building in Rhode Island. It has been vacant for nearly a decade. McKee said the $220 million redevelopment project will reinvigorate downtown Providence and bring the Superman Building “back to life.” Opened in 1928, it resembles the Daily Planet headquarters in the old “Adventures of Superman” TV show. McKee said $26 million will come from state housing and economic development programs, and $15 million will come from the city through a loan and a direct contribution. Massachusetts-based High Rock Development committed to providing more than $42 million and will take advantage of federal tax credits and seek a tax stabilization agreement from the city, McKee said. High Rock Development bought the building in 2008. In 2013, the sole tenant, Bank of America, moved out. The value of the building dropped, and it fell into disrepair.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A unique gold medal celebrating a battle victory that helped turn the tide in the American Revolution brought a world-record $960,000 at auction. An anonymous buyer of the Daniel Morgan at Cowpens Medal won with a bid of $800,000 on April 4. With the 20% buyer’s premium, the final price was $960,000, according to Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Costa Mesa, California. The medal honors Revolutionary War Gen. Daniel Morgan and his victory at the 1781 Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. It was struck in 1839 at the Philadelphia Mint. “Everyone’s pretty excited,” said numismatist John Kraljevich of Fort Mill, who specializes in rare, early medals and authenticated the anonymously consigned medal. The front of the medal depicts Morgan leading an infantry charge on horseback against a retreating British cavalry. The back features a Native American woman placing a crown of laurels on Morgan’s head. The original medal was struck in Paris in 1789 and given to Morgan in 1790. After his death in 1802, grandson and heir Morgan Neville owned the medal and stored it in a bank vault in Pittsburgh. It was stolen in 1818 during a robbery. In 1836, Congress authorized the strike of a single replacement, and it remained in the family until about 1885. At one point the medal was acquired by famed financier banker J.P. Morgan, who incorrectly believed he was related to Daniel Morgan, Kraljevich said. The medal then disappeared from view and was thought to have been lost or melted. Only in recent months did it reappear when consigned anonymously to the auction house.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House on Tuesday impeached Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a pedestrian but initially said he might have struck a deer or another large animal. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history. He will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Senate trial, where it takes a two-thirds majority to convict on impeachment charges. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest last year to a pair of traffic misdemeanors in the crash, including making an illegal lane change. He has cast Joseph Boever’s death as a tragic accident. In voting 36-31 to impeach Ranvsborg, the Republican-controlled House charged him with committing crimes that caused someone’s death, making “numerous misrepresentations” to law enforcement officers after the crash and using his office to navigate the criminal investigation. “When we’re dealing with the life of one of your citizens, I think that weighed heavily on everyone,” said GOP Rep. Will Mortenson, who introduced the articles of impeachment. A spokesman for Ravnsborg did not reply to a request for comment after the vote. Tim Bormann, the attorney general’s chief of staff, said his staff would “professionally dedicate ourselves” to their work while Ranvsborg is forced to take a leave.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will soon decide whether to sign off on adding harsh penalties against public schools in his state that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. The GOP-controlled Legislature finished advancing the proposal Monday, with Senate Republicans approving the measure 26-5. The House had previously approved the bill last month. Lee, a Republican, hasn’t said publicly whether he supports the legislation. However, he signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, lawmakers decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. “What this bill does is put teeth in that legislation,” said Republican state Sen. Joey Hensley. Under the legislation headed to Lee’s desk, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of a state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Many of the state’s cattle ranchers are culling herds because of rising costs for feed and fuel, along with the looming prospect that ongoing drought conditions could worsen this summer. Consolidation of the meatpacking industry in recent years also has reduced the market power of ranchers, who sit at the very beginning of a lengthy line of processors, packers, wholesalers and retailers in bringing beef to consumers.“I tell (people) the packers are making all the money,” said Shelby Horn, general manager of Abell Livestock. Cattle prices have been climbing along with increased consumer demand for beef as the broad economy continues recovering from its pandemic-induced downturn. But they haven’t yet risen enough to offset the multiple headwinds facing many ranchers, Horn and other experts say. Texas is by far the largest producer of beef cattle in the country, with a herd that totals about 4.5 million animals – 2.3 million more than Oklahoma, the second-largest producer, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sales of beef cattle and calves in Texas generate about $8.5 billion annually and constitute the state’s top agricultural commodity. But the Texas herd shrunk 3.5% last year – or by about 160,000 head – outpacing a 2.3% decline in the U.S. beef cattle herd overall.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s increasingly popular national parks will offer free entrance Saturday to kick off National Park Week. The nationwide celebration, lasting through April 24, aims to “boost awareness of the value and availability of recreational areas, encouraging people across the country to spend time in America’s treasured national parks,” according to a U.S. Senate press release. In celebration, entrance into all national parks will be free April 16. That includes Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the state increased by 33% in 2021 to a record number of 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported. The report released last week found that fentanyl was involved in 93% of last year’s opioid deaths, while the percentage of deaths that involved heroin dropped from 25% in 2020 to 10% last year. Cocaine was involved in 48% of all opioid-related overdose deaths, according to the report. The study also found that use of methamphetamine and the drug xylazine, a veterinary sedative, were increasingly contributing to opioid-related fatal overdoses among Vermont residents. The 2021 figure of 210 was up from 158 in 2020. The report lists opioid fatalities going back to 2010, when there were 37. Chittenden County had the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths last year at 38, while Rutland County had the highest rate of opioid deaths per 100,000 residents at 48, according to the report.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed substantial changes to a hemp bill aimed at reining in the retail sales of products containing a psychoactive form of THC, including amendments that would create new misdemeanor penalties for marijuana possession. The bill is among more than 100 pieces of legislation the Republican governor is seeking to amend, his office announced late Monday, just ahead of a deadline Youngkin faced to take action on bills sent to his desk. Lawmakers will meet April 27 to consider the governor’s proposed amendments and will also have the chance to override his vetoes. The hemp measure rewrote the definition of marijuana in state code in a way industry players said would have severely curtailed the sale of CBD products that don’t produce a high, in addition to ending the retail sales of delta-8, a chemical cousin of pot’s main intoxicating ingredient, sales of which have proliferated around the country. Youngkin’s amendments would also create a Class 2 misdemeanor offense for possession of more than 2 and less than 6 ounces of marijuana and a Class 1 misdemeanor for possession of more than 6 ounces and less than 1 pound. A 2021 law passed when Democrats were in full control of state government laid out a years­long pathway toward retail sales and legalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana. Anyone possessing an amount between an ounce and a pound is currently subject to a small civil fine.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A new law could reshape the way child dependency cases are handled in the state, potentially leading to more children staying with family members without those relatives being required to adopt them. Under the current practice, Washington state forces relatives to adopt children when neither parent can take care of the child. If family members don’t wish to adopt, the Department of Children, Youth and Families removes children from those placements, even if those relatives still want permanent kinship guardianship, and places the child up for adoption. “We’re removing children out of relatives’ homes, loving relatives’ homes, because they’re unwilling to adopt,” said Shrounda Selivanoff, director of public policy for the Children’s Home Society of Washington and a proponent and writer of the legislation. Children’s Home Society said the state currently “prioritizes termination” of parental rights instead of using other options, the News Tribune reports. Termination of parental rights is not required when a dependency case ends, they said. Under the new law, the state won’t be allowed to move children from their relatives’ care if those relatives don’t want to adopt. Financial assistance also has been expanded for relatives who are eligible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Free tire collection events are scheduled around the state this month. The events are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 23 behind the Go-Mart in the Cabin Creek community in Kanawha County, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 at Clay County High School, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 23 at the Old Oak Ridge Trucking Lot in Elkins and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 30 at the HL Wilson Trucking Lot in Moorefield, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said. Each person may dispose of up to 10 tires. The tires must be off the rims. Only car and light truck tires are accepted, the agency said. Ongoing tire collections are held regularly in Boone, Brooke, Calhoun, Fayette, Hancock, Mason, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Putnam, Tucker, Wayne and Wyoming counties. Upcoming tire collection events are listed on the department’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: New data shows a sharp increase in Type 2 diabetes among children in the state, and doctors think COVID-19 could be a factor. Figures from UW Health Kids shows a nearly 200% increase in the number of cases over the past several years. Dr. Elizabeth Mann, a pediatric endocrinologist and director of the Type 2 Diabetes Program at UW Health Kids, said it’s a trend medical experts have noticed for years, but it’s taken a worrisome turn recently. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve just seen a sharp increase beyond what we had expected,” Mann said. In 2018, 5.8% of pediatric patients with new onset diabetes at Madison’s American Family Children’s Hospital had Type 2, a disease that primarily affects adults. In 2021, that number grew to 16.4%. And so far in 2022, 1 in 6 pediatric patients at the children’s hospital with new onset diabetes has Type 2, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “In kids, this Type 2 diabetes just acts a little bit more aggressively,” Mann said. “So it’s not only that we’re seeing Type 2 diabetes at younger ages, but it also seems to be a more severe form where kids are needing more medications and have more significant complications from it.” In Type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form overall, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body has developed a resistance to it. Mann said it’s a common misconception that Type 2 diabetes is purely a result of diet and activity levels. She said genetics and epigenetics play a big role in making people more susceptible.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State wildlife officials have detected avian influenza among wild birds in Wyoming, include Canada geese and great horned owls, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/us/nyc-bronx-apartment-fire-monday/index.html", "title": "New York fire: Space heater sparked fire in the Bronx that killed 17 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA malfunctioning electric space heater in a bedroom was the source of an apartment building fire Sunday in the Bronx that killed 17 people, including 8 children, making it one of the worst fires in the city’s history, New York Mayor Eric Adams said Monday.\n\nAdams revised the death toll Monday down from 19, saying it was an evolving situation. A CNN review of local hospitals shows that at least eight patients are still hospitalized in relation to the fire, while at least 25 people have been treated and released.\n\nNow, the building’s fire alarms and a series of open doors are on the radar of investigators and officials probing the second major deadly fire in a week in the Northeast.\n\nThe Bronx blaze was deemed the second most deadly US home fire in nearly 40 years by the National Fire Protection Association. The NFPA also reported that heating equipment is the second-leading cause of US home fires and the third-leading cause of home fire deaths and injuries.\n\n“This is a horrific, horrific, painful moment for the city of New York, and the impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of just pain and despair in our city,” Adams said Sunday.\n\nMany of those in the building were Muslim immigrants from the West African nation of The Gambia. The country’s ambassador told CNN the building had been a beloved home for many such immigrants over the years.\n\n“I think a lot of Gambians who came here, they stayed there before they moved anywhere else. This was kind of a first port of call, this building. It’s a building Gambians have a lot of attachment to,” said Ambassador Dawda Docka Fadera, who traveled from Washington to New York after learning of the fire.\n\nThe families in the apartment complex and neighborhood told CNN they were devastated. Some are still searching for loved ones, and all are desperate for answers.\n\n“I’m totally worried and devastated — not me alone, but the whole community and the family at large. Everybody’s worried. We don’t know what happened. … That’s the toughest thing – not knowing,” says Yusupha Jawara, who spoke with CNN at a mosque where many were praying for the victims.\n\nLive updates: The latest on the Bronx apartment fire\n\nThe Red Cross has provided emergency housing to 22 families, representing 56 adults and 25 children, the group said in a statement.\n\nA woman is assisted by rescue personnel January 9.

Scott Heins/Getty Images In pictures: Bronx apartment fire kills more than a dozen people, including children Prev Next\n\nThe five-alarm fire began shortly before 11 a.m. ET and first consumed the bedroom, then the entire duplex apartment on the second and third floors of the 19-story building, Nigro said.\n\n“The heat was on in the building. This (the space heater) was being used to supplement the building heat. There were smoke alarms throughout the building. The first call that came in was due to a neighbor hearing the smoke alarm and looking and seeing the smoke and calling,” he said.\n\nWhen residents left the fiery unit, the apartment door was left open, allowing the blaze to spread, Nigro said. The fire was contained to that hallway, but the smoke traveled upwards and took over much of the building. The doors were supposed to close automatically, but the apartment door as well as the door from the stairwell to the 15th floor were not functioning properly, Nigro said Monday.\n\n“The smoke spread throughout the building, thus, the tremendous loss of life and other people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx,” he said. “So, we are investigating where everyone was found, how the smoke traveled, but certainly the marshals have determined through physical evidence and through firsthand accounts by the residents that this fire started in the bedroom, in a portable electric heater.”\n\nAbout 200 members of the FDNY responded to the fire at 333 East 181st Street, the agency said. Units arrived at the scene within three minutes of getting an emergency call, Nigro said. They “found victims on every floor in stairways,” he said, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest.\n\n“It was a very difficult job for our members. Their air tanks contained a certain amount of air – they ran out of air, many of our members – and they continued working to try to get as many people out as they could,” he said.\n\nResidents say they narrowly escaped smoke and flames\n\nEmergency personnel work Sunday at the scene of the fatal Bronx fire. Yuki Iwamura/AP\n\nDaisy Mitchell, a 10th-floor resident who had just moved in to the building, was one of those who fled to safety. She told CNN’s Brianna Keilar her husband first smelled smoke and noticed the fire.\n\n“The alarm was going off for a while so I didn’t pay it no mind,” she said. “Then, when he opened the door and I went out there, I passed out — it was devastating, it was like really scary.”\n\n“I went to the stairs, I opened the door, it just blew me back [to] the house,” she added. “If I’d stayed out there for another three seconds, I would have been gone too.”\n\nIt was common for fire alarms to go off in the building, 10th-floor resident Chanasia Hunter told CNN affiliate WABC.\n\n“So, when you don’t know that it’s a fire, like, you know, how would you supposed to know if it’s a fire or if it’s always going off?” said Hunter, adding she got a call from a resident on the third floor warning her of the fire, then a knock on her door telling her and her family to get out.\n\nKaren Dejesus lives on the same floor as the apartment that caught fire and said the flames encroached on her residence.\n\n“I can see the flames, I can see the smoke and everything, you know, coming into my apartment,” Dejesus said. “You’re being trapped somewhere. As you see, we have no fire escapes, obviously the building was not fireproof like we thought it was.”\n\nDejesus said firefighters broke down her door to rescue her, her granddaughter and her son. They had to climb out of a window to escape the flames.\n\nShe, too, noted fire alarms in the building often went off.\n\n“So many of us were used to hearing that fire alarm go off so it was like second nature to us,” she said. “Not until I actually seen the smoke coming in the door, I realized it was a real fire and I heard people yelling help, help, help.”\n\n“I thank God that me and my family are safe,” said Dejesus. “I’m sorry for all of my neighbors that didn’t make it, I’m sorry for my neighbors that are still in the hospital fighting for their life. This was crazy, this was so scary.”\n\nFire alarms and self-closing doors are focus of investigation\n\nInvestigators are examining potential issues with the fire alarms and with self-closing doors designed to contain fire and smoke.\n\nReports of smoke alarms frequently malfunctioning will be looked into, Nigro said, adding he couldn’t confirm them.\n\nThe building had no fire escapes, but “there are interior stairways,” he said. “So, the residents should know where the stairwells are, and I think some of them could not escape because of the volume of smoke.”\n\nMayor Adams, speaking to CNN’s Brianna Keilar, said fire marshals will investigate the self-closing doors in the building to see if there was a malfunction. New York passed a law in 2018 making self-closing doors a requirement in buildings with three or more apartments.\n\n“We have a law here in NYC that requires doors to close automatically,” he said. “We also want to double down on that PSA that I recall as a child… close the doors,” he said.\n\nThere have been no major building violations or complaints listed against the building, which contains 120 units, according to city building records. Past minor violations were rectified by the property, and no structural violations were listed.\n\nBuilt in 1972, the building was federally funded, so may have been built outside the New York City fire code, Nigro said, adding it was unlikely to have been a factor in Sunday’s blaze.\n\n“Certain federal buildings can be built under different standards. But to be perfectly clear, the fire itself – other than getting in the hall because the door was open – never extended anywhere else in the building, so that was not a factor.”\n\nAt a news conference Monday, New York firefighter union representatives confirmed the building was not required to adhere to city fire codes.\n\n“There was different fire protection in this building than we have in tenements and other high rises under the New York City code,” said Jim McCarthy, president of the FDNY Fire Officers Association. “So it exposed members to a more dangerous atmosphere.”\n\nLife-saving fire protection devises like sprinkler systems were oftentimes not a requirement in older buildings, McCarthy said.\n\nMany older buildings in the city have been retrofitted with sprinklers, McCarthy said. It doesn’t appear this building had a sprinkler system installed, according to Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association.\n\nFor the victims, the city will work to ensure Islamic funeral and burial rites are respected and will seek Muslim leaders to connect with residents, said Adams, who took office only this month. The names of those who request government assistance will not be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he added.\n\nResidents of the apartment building were initially housed at a middle school next door, and longer-term shelter for them would be found, said Christina Farrell, first deputy commissioner of NYC emergency management.\n\nLow-income areas face higher fire risk, official says\n\nThe “tragic and terrifying” fire underscores the need for federal investment in affordable housing, said Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents residents of the apartment building.\n\n“Many of these buildings are old. Not every apartment has a fire alarm. Most of these buildings have no sprinkler system. And so the risk of a fire is much higher in lower-income neighborhoods in the Bronx than it might be elsewhere in the city or in the country,” Torres told MSNBC.\n\n“When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk. These buildings are wide open to catastrophic fires that can cost people their lives, including the lives of children.”\n\nThe Bronx has been the scene of other grave fires in recent decades – the most deadly in 1990, when 87 people died at the Happy Land social club. In 2007, 10 people – nine of them children – were killed in a fire at a residence after a space heater cord overheated.\n\nIn December 2017, 13 people died when a fire broke out at an apartment block. The fatal fire began when a 3-year-old played with burners on the stove and started a kitchen fire, officials said. When the boy’s mother fled the apartment with him and his 2-year-old sister, she left the door open.\n\nThe apartment’s stairway acted “like a chimney,” and the fire rapidly spread through the apartment building, Nigro said at the time. After that fire, the city passed the self-closing door law.", "authors": ["Susannah Cullinane Brynn Gingras Bonney Kapp Mirna Alsharif Amir Vera", "Susannah Cullinane", "Brynn Gingras", "Bonney Kapp", "Mirna Alsharif", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}]}
