Since late 2020, the world has been facing an unexpected dearth of microchips – the tiny integrated circuits that are nowadays found in practically every manufactured device with a battery or a plug – from toasters to TVs to airbags to fighter jets.\n\nThe scarcity was first seen in sophisticated consumer electronics: gaming consoles like the PlayStation 5 and the new Xbox have had big order backlogs; prices for computer graphics cards have shot up. But because semiconductor chips are so ubiquitous, a large number of industries have been affected.\n\nThe car industry has been hit hardest of all. Modern cars can easily contain 3,000 chips, and the shortage has slowed down vehicle assembly lines across the world: global output will drop by four million cars, nearly 5%, this year.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Fabrication plants (“fabs”) for advanced chips are among the world’s most complex manufacturing facilities, costing tens of billions of dollars to build. Lasers print billions of transistors onto tiny areas of silicon wafers; it can take three to four months to turn a large silicon wafer into a useable batch of chips.\n\nSo the industry tends to swing between undersupply and oversupply, in what economists callapork cycle: as with breeding pigs, there are lags in production. Producers invest when prices are high and find they are left with too much capacity when it finally comes on stream. At present, however, the trend in the industry is of remorseless expansion: green tech, cloud computing, 5G, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, robotics – all these growth areas eat up chips. And the pandemic has helped to create the perfect storm.\n\nWhat effect did the pandemic have?\n\nIt closed down many fabs temporarily. At the same time, the great increase in working from home, and the increase in demand for home entertainment, created a surge in demand for electronics. PC sales rose by 13% last year. In New York City alone, the department of education bought 350,000 iPads. Video calling meant that data centres needed more capacity.\n\nAnd during the worst of the pandemic, car purchases plummeted. So while electronics companies bought up all available production capacity, car manufacturers cancelled their orders. But later, when the carmakers were ready to gear up production again, they found themselves at the back of the queue: microchip fabs can take up to six months to re-start production of specific types of chip.\n\nHow does this affect us?\n\nThe supply of cars for sale is set to be restricted later this year because of the shortage, the leading UK motor dealership Pendragon warned last week. With fewer cars to sell, prices will rise; and premium electronic features like navigation systems or extra screens are being dropped in order to stretch the supply of chips further.\n\nIn electronics, trade prices for computer memory have risen around 30% since the start of 2020, pushing up costs for items such as laptops and printers. HP has raised consumer PC prices by 8% and printers by more than 20% in a year. Prices for TVs, smartphones and home appliances look set to increase too. The chip shortage also has governments worried.\n\nWhy are governments worried?\n\nChips are now such a crucial component in many strategic technologies – from defence systems to cybersecurity to renewable energy – that their manufacture has become a big geopolitical issue: policymakers say that “chips are the new oil”. They were invented in the US, and much of the cutting-edge design still takes place there, but around 80% of production now happens in Asia because costs are lower: mostly in Taiwan, South Korea and China.\n\nThe world’s biggest producer by volume is TSMC in Taiwan. Intel, based in California, is the biggest by revenue. Along with South Korea’s Samsung, these companies dominate high-end, specialised chips. But China is positioned to become the largest producer by 2030: its latest five-year plan sets the goal of meeting 70% of its semiconductor needs by 2025. Europe accounts for less than 10% of global chip production.\n\nJoe Biden holds up a microchip as he speaks during a meeting with members of the House and Senate about supply chain disruptions due to coronavirus in the Oval Office in February 2021 (Image credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat are governments doing about it?\n\nLast month, the US Senate passed the Innovation and Competition Act, a $250bn bill designed to boost US semiconductor production, along with scientific research and other strategic technologies.\n\nIn March, the European Commission set out an ambitious plan to grow its share of the global semiconductor market to 20% by 2030, and committed $160bn of its Covid recovery fund to tech projects. The UK has long had a strong presence in the design side of the industry, but few producers; Newport Wafer Fab, the UK’s largest chip producer, has been acquired by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned company.\n\nHow long will the shortage last?\n\nThere is no end in sight. Intel’s chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, said that he thinks it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “The shortage will probably continue for a few years,” said Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Technologies, earlier in the year. The likes of TSMC, Samsung and Intel are all investing heavily.\n\nBut “even if chip factories are built all over the world, it takes time”, says Dell. Many companies are examining their supply chains: Tesla is considering buyingachip plant outright. High-tech industries will probably recover first, towards the end of this year. Cars and home appliances, which use cheaper, older chips will take longer: they are not so profitable for manufacturers, so there is not the impetus for them to invest. Product delays and parts shortages will continue for some time.\n\nThe triumph of the microchip\n\nA microchip is a collection of anywhere from a few hundred to tens of billions of tiny circuits on a small wafer of silicon. Silicon is a semiconductor – it can either conduct electricity or contain it. On a chip, silicon transistors are miniature switches that can be turned on and off by electronic signals. Computers run using binary code. Transistors reflect this: the digits 1 and 0 used in binary represent the on and off states of a transistor. Essentially, the chip’s job is to shuttle electrons around in a way prescribed by computer code. All the data on computers – numbers, pictures, music, images – is stored and processed in this way.\n\nEmployees of Japan’s microprocessor maker Renesas Electronics in June 2021 (Image credit: KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe invention of this kind of transistor, at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1947, and its increasing miniaturisation is the backbone of modern electronics. Moore’s Law, coined by the chip pioneer Gordon Moore, states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every two years, making computers ever more powerful.\n\nToday’s advanced chips are dizzyingly complex: lasers imprint circuits just 12 nanometres wide, the length a fingernail grows in 12 seconds. Transistors are thought to be the most manufactured items in world history. The number of microchips sold globally in April reached a record of nearly 100 billion.\n\nThe Week Unwrapped: Fashion for rent, a chip shortage and euthanasia\n\nYou can subscribe to The Week Unwrapped on the Global Player, Apple podcasts, SoundCloud or wherever you get you get your podcasts.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/tech/us-chip-manufacturing-semiconductors", "title": "The US is spending billions to boost chip manufacturing. Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/05/03/ford-gm-semiconductor-chip-super-duty-kentucky/4918434001/", "title": "Ford, GM hit hardest by chip crisis as Super Duty trucks pile up in KY", "text": "As Kentucky Derby fans traveled along I-71 to and from Churchill Downs over the weekend, it would've been hard not to notice while driving through Sparta the thousands of Super Duty pickup trucks parked in rows.\n\nThis illustrates the multibillion-dollar impact of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage on the auto industry, specifically Ford Motor Co.

The company calculates factory-by-factory company announcements, shift production and work schedules in the U.S., Asia and Europe.\n\nSo far, that lost vehicle production globally this year has been projected to be:\n\nFord, 362,663 fewer vehicles\n\nGeneral Motors, 326,651\n\nRenault Nissan Mitsubishi, 284,948\n\nVolkswagen, 207,521\n\nStellantis, 202,486\n\nToyota, 113,555\n\nHonda, 82,482\n\nAutomakers impacted to a lesser extent include BMW, Hyundai, Daimler and Tesla. These figures do not include joint ventures between the Detroit Three and their partners in China, Russia, Turkey and elsewhere. The GM numbers include its subsidiary GM Korea.\n\nWhile vehicle production could be made up toward the end of the year, it is less likely with every month that passes.\n\nMeanwhile, GM is the hardest hit automaker in North America, based on current projections for the year:\n\nGM, 277,030 vehicles\n\nFord, 234,964\n\nStellantis, 162,087\n\nSubaru, 45,272\n\nHonda, 42,951\n\nRenault Nissan Mitsubishi, 41,928\n\nVW, 36,429\n\nToyota, 23,670\n\nTesla, 6,418\n\nSome reduction was seen by Mazda and Hyundai, too.\n\nGM is scheduled to release earnings Wednesday. Stellantis said it will reveal its shipments and revenues the same day.\n\n\"This is a growing concern,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n\"Like COVID last year, from the beginning it seemed like it would go away in the near term but as the months go by, it's growing into a bigger and bigger issue,\" he said. \"It takes so long to get a plant up and running that's dedicated to these particular chips. With the increased computerization of vehicles, these chips are the lifeblood. They operate the powertrain control unit, the infotainment. You can drive a car without the infotainment system but you can't sell a car without an infotainment system. You can't run an engine without certain chips. They're the nerve center of different sections of the vehicle.\"\n\nFord was the first of the Detroit Three to release its first-quarter earnings, which exceeded Wall Street expectations. But then the company forecast depressed the stock price almost immediately.\n\n“All automakers will be dramatically impacted by the chip shortage so it sure seems off that Ford got punished for its transparent honesty,\" said market analyst Jon Gabrielsen.\n\nFord challenged whether its situation is much different than its competitors.\n\n“The global semiconductor shortage is affecting automakers around the world — as well as other industries, including consumer electronics companies,\" Jennifer Flake, executive director of global product communications, told the Free Press in response to the AutoForecast data.\n\n\"Ford is concentrating on how to best use our allocation of semiconductors to deliver high-demand vehicles to customers around the world,\" she said. \"Ford was among the first automotive companies to highlight the potential impact of (the) semiconductor shortage earlier this year to first-quarter production and our forecast was in line with the actual impact to the industry, as reported by IHS. Our most recent forecast for the second quarter is based on commitments from our suppliers who also support other automakers. Therefore, we don’t know that Ford is unique.”\n\nFord was hit hard by a March 19 fire at the Renesas plant northeast of Tokyo, a leading semiconductor supplier that makes about two-thirds of all chips in the auto industry, Farley said. The chipmaker isn't expecting a return to full capacity until July.\n\n\"Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into the fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022, making industry volume recovery in the second half of the year even more challenging,\" Farley said.\n\nFord expects the chip crisis to cost the company an estimated $3 billion this year, Lawler said.\n\nBut that's not all that automakers are facing.\n\nWhile commodity price remained stable because of 2020 contracts, Ford is now expecting to see prices on aluminum, steel and precious metals increase by about $2.5 billion, Farley said. \"So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year.\"\n\nInvestor's Business Daily said Thursday: \"Ford Stock Sinks After Slashing Q2 Production Targets On Chip Shortage That May Last Through 2022.\"\n\nBarron's said on the same day, \"Ford Earnings Crushed Expectations.

The deal expands TSMC's investments here to $65 billion as a result of a $6.6 billion grant by the U.S. Commerce Department under the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe company's investment in Arizona and the federal CHIPS Act grant were announced Monday. The expansion will make the state a \"hub for innovation . . . positioning it to be a world leader for decades,\" said Lael Brainard, a White House national economic adviser, in an April 7 conference call with the media.\n\nWhen production kicks in, TSMC's north Phoenix facility near 43rd Avenue and Dove Valley Road \"will be making the most advanced semiconductor chips on the planet, in America with American workers,\" declared Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who also participated in the conference call.\n\nTSMC also could receive up to $5 billion in federal loans.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Commerce Department so far has announced five CHIPS Act grants, and three of them have ties to Arizona.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who championed the CHIPS Act, issued a statement hailing the announcement. He said a domestic manufacturing capability for advanced semiconductors is essential for the United States to avoid \"significant economic and national-security vulnerabilities.\"\n\nSenators Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who helped to move the CHIPS legisation through Congress, also issued statements in support, with Kelly noting that many of the current and future jobs at the TSMC complex would be open to workers without four-year college degrees.\n\nPacking more computing power into smaller spaces\n\nIn January, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu seemingly left the door open to the possibility of 2nm, or nanometer manufacturing at the Phoenix facility. On the company’s quarterly earnings call, Liu said TSMC was still determining what technology would be implemented in the second phase of the fab.\n\nIn semiconductors, nanometer measure refers to the distance between transistors on the chip —meaning there can be more transistors, and more dense designs, on a smaller nanometer chip. If a chip has a tinier dimension, it has more transistors in the same space as one with a larger nanometer measure, meaning more diminutive chips can have the same amount of processing power in a much smaller area.\n\nSo far, no semiconductor manufacturers are producing 2nm chips at scale. TSMC manufactures 3nm chips at its Taiwan facility, but not yet in the United States.\n\n“The primary goal for the CHIPS for America program is to manufacture the world’s most advanced chips in the United States, which we do not do now,” Raimondo said.\n\nAbout 70% of TSMC's customers are U.S. companies that have made it clear they would like to buy chips produced in the U.S., she said. Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia are among TSMC's customers.\n\nSenior administration officials said a very clear use for 2nm technology is in artificial intelligence, which can require billions of operations per second.\n\nMore Arizona tech investments could follow\n\nThe $65 billion commitment by TSMC will represent the largest foreign direct investment in completely new projects in U.S. history, Raimondo said, to say nothing of shattering private-sector investment records in Arizona.\n\nTSMC, which already is building two fabs in north Phoenix at a cost of $40 billion, agreed to leverage the new Commerce Department grant into an additional $25 billion corporate stake. The company will start to produce 2nm chips in Phoenix by the time production at the third fab begins before the end of the decade.\n\nAll of this will result in tens of thousands of jobs at TSMC, for construction workers and at suppliers, many of which also stand to receive grants or loans under the CHIPS legislation, which was enacted in 2022. For example, Amkor Technology recently announced a new $2 billion investment in Peoria.\n\nThe new CHIPS funding for TSMC also will augment partnerships with Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, Purdue University, Maricopa Community Colleges and other educational institutions. Administration officials predicted the agreement could help to generate around 6,000 new direct jobs at TSMC.\n\nThe CHIPS Act announcement is the third with Arizona ties in recent weeks.\n\nWhile not as big as the $8.5 billion in planned grants for Intel's expanding campus in Chandler, which President Biden visited last month, the TSMC announcement is potentially more transformative, given the Taiwan company's dominant role in developing and producing the most advanced chips.\n\nEarlier this year, Chandler-based Microchip Technology received $162 million in tentative CHIPS Act semiconductor funding, though its production will happen in Colorado and Oregon, not Arizona.\n\nMore grants await for suppliers that provide equipment, essential materials and other support for the semiconductor industry. According to data from the Arizona Commerce Authority, 35 semiconductor industry companies — including TSMC and Intel — have announced new locations or have expanded in Arizona since 2020.\n\nThere will be further funding opportunities ahead for many of these companies from the CHIPS Act. Expanding the domestic semiconductor supply chain was a key rationale for the legislation.\n\nArizona leaders react to TSMC grant: 'At the forefront of our country’s economic future'\n\nHow the grant money will be spent\n\nSenior administration officials said the $6.6 billion grant to TSMC will be allocated across the three phases of construction, including $50 million allocated to workforce development in Arizona.\n\nThe funding will mostly go toward the construction of TSMC's facilities, and federal payments will be made as milestones are hit.\n\nTSMC initially announced one fab in north Phoenix in 2021, before the CHIPS Act was enacted, followed by a second and now a third. Production at the first factory is slated to begin during the first half of 2025, the second in 2028 and the third before 2030.\n\nThe CHIPS Act legislation is a hallmark of Biden's efforts to rejuvenate U.S. industrial policy, especially in semiconductors, which were invented in the U.S. and power so many types of modern equipment.\n\nMetro Phoenix already is gaining increasing recognition in related fields such as data centers, where a recent report ranked the area sixth highest globally. The concentrated industrial computers in these complexes also rely on advanced semiconductors.\n\nLow natural-disaster risks favors Arizona\n\nTSMC was in the news last week when Taiwan was struck by the strongest earthquakes to hit the island nation in 25 years. The company briefly suspended work at some construction sites and paused some operations.\n\nThe quakes caused fatalities and significant property damage elsewhere in Taiwan, but the company’s operations weren’t harmed and workers returned safely soon after the incident.\n\nStill, the low risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters in Arizona was one of many reasons that the company originally decided to establish a major presence here, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nOther reasons include available land, a strong educational base, an expanding tech-focused workforce and pro-business local and state public policies.\n\nReach the writers at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic and cvanek@arizonarepublic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2025/01/27/china-deepseek-ai-stocks-impact/77966585007/", "title": "DeepSeek AI sinks Nasdaq, S&P 500.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe broad S&P 500 ended down 1.46%, or 88.96 points, to 6,012.28 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 3.07%, or 612.47 points, to 19,341.83. Both posted their worst one-day decline since Dec. 18.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow erased early losses to close up 0.65%, or 289.33 points, to 44,713.58 as investors sold riskier tech stocks and bought value shares.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid to 4.532%, also on a move to safe returns as tech stocks crumbled. That was the lowest level since Dec. 20.\n\nWill DeepSeek kill the bull market?\n\nDeepSeek is unlikely to bring an end to the bull run in stocks, \"but it could contribute to volatility and potentially initiate a market correction, especially if investors begin to question the long-term dominance of U.S. tech giants,\" said technology expert Faisal Hoque, author of \"TRANSCEND: Unlocking Humanity in the Age of AI.\"\n\nAdam Nathan, chief executive and co-founder of AI marketing tool Blaze, actually thinks DeepSeek's \"really good\" for the AI industry because it introduces competition.\n\nBefore DeepSeek, the U.S. market was wedded to the idea it would take billions of dollars to develop AI.\n\n\"Smaller startups have thrown in the towel on the assumption that they could never afford the necessary (computing power) to develop their own models,\" said Deutsche Bank analysts in a note. \"Take that advantage away and a new breed of competitors may be able to flourish.\"\n\nWhat Trump's tariff threat to Colombia says\n\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump again threatened tariffs but this time, against Colombia for refusing planes returning deported migrants to the country. However, emergency 25% tariffs were averted after Colombia agreed to accept the migrants.\n\n\"By bypassing some of the largest U.S. trade partners and proceeding with tariffs on Colombia, the Trump administration signaled its readiness to fully leverage its power to ensure compliance with its immigration policy,\" said JP Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Gregory Shearer in a note. Trump also showed he would justify imposing tariffs by declaring an economic or national security emergency through an executive order.\n\nThis \"may increase concerns that the Trump administration will be more aggressive on this front than previously thought,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley.\n\nArabica coffee prices initially jumped to a record high on Trump's tariff threat. The U.S. sources approximately 30% of its coffee from Colombia.\n\nCorporate news and earnings to watch\n\nAttention around DeepSeek's AI model is likely to shine a brighter light on earnings from big U.S. tech companies this week.\n\n\"What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,\" Larkin said. \"That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.\"\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven members, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Tesla and Apple are due to report their latest quarterly results this week.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are large-cap technology companies that have significant weighting in major stock indexes and have led much of the rally in stocks the past few years. They are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia.\n\nCompanies that reported on Monday morning include:\n\nAT&T shares closed up 6.25%, after setting a new 52-week high during the session. The telecom reported better-than-expected quarterly results and added more subscribers than analysts had predicted it would.\n\nSofi said it expects earnings in the first three months of the year and for the full year to miss analysts' forecasts. Shares of the fintech lost 10.3%.\n\nFed rate watch\n\nAlmost no one expects the Federal Reserve to lower rates at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday, but investors will be looking for hints as to whether the Fed is finished cutting rates this year or will there be more to come.\n\nThe stock market decline on Monday could also influence the Fed's rate view, said analysts at Dutch bank ING.\n\n\"If this leads to a broader correction, then the Fed will be much more inclined to cut rates and will come under intense pressure to do so from President Trump,\" they said in a note.\n\n\"If a sense of worry starts to hit these free-spending households, they may well start to pull back on some of their consumption, and the Fed will be much more inclined to respond with lower interest rates,\" the analysts said.\n\nBitcoin drops\n\nBitcoin slipped in early trading, along with the rout in tech stocks as investors' shied away from riskier bets on Monday morning.\n\nHowever, investors are still hopeful the Trump administration will be friendly with its cryptocurrency regulation in the longer-term.\n\nBitcoin was down 0.88% to $102,110.20 in late afternoon trading. During the day, the cryptocurrency crashed below the psychological $100,000 milestone for the first time since Trump returned to the White House.\n\n(This story was updated with new information.)\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

What's next for the FAANGs? | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe great bull run for tech stocks may finally be over.\n\nIt has been a brutal year for the leading companies of Silicon Valley. Apple’s (AAPL) stock is down about 16% in 2022 — and that makes it the “best” performer of the so-called FAANGs of Big Tech. Facebook owner Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have all done far worse, with Meta plunging 66% this year.\n\nOther titans of the Nasdaq, such as Microsoft (MSFT), chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) have fallen between 25% and 45% in 2022 as well. (The Nasdaq itself is down nearly 30%.)\n\nThe tech sector has been a market leader for years, but there are growing concerns about the future. Recent earnings have not been great.\n\nEconomic downturn would hurt tech\n\nLiz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, noted in a report late last week that tech earnings during the third quarter fell 1% from a year ago and that revisions for the fourth quarter have been cut by nearly 10% in recent weeks. It could get worse.\n\n“With this being the first quarter of a meaningful tone change in earnings … I don’t think it will be the last one of margin pressure,” Young wrote. She added that “it’s becoming clear that we may at least see recessionary conditions in some sectors, even if they don’t bleed into all facets of the economy. Tech is one of those sectors.”\n\nThere are also legitimate questions about strategy shifts at some companies. Meta, for example, is going all in on augmented and virtual reality while Netflix is now embracing advertising after years of vowing it would not have ads on its platforms.\n\nBroader worries about the economy and advertising spending are hurting the sector. Many of the tech giants have already announced layoffs, and there is speculation that there could be more job cuts coming.\n\nRecession worries don’t bode well for consumer spending, which is bad for Amazon and Apple in particular. And the tech leaders all face tougher competition — in some cases from one another — but also from rivals around the globe.\n\nWith that in mind, this could be just the beginning of a tech bear market.\n\nTodd Sohn, director and technical strategist at Strategas, noted in a report late last week that when tech stocks imploded in 2000 as the dot-com bubble burst, it wasn’t until after the 2008 financial crisis before tech resumed a role as a market leader.\n\nSohn said tech could be in for another long winter ahead, noting that it’s “reasonable to expect that tech could take a backseat over the next couple of years, while energy, industrials, etc. assume the same type of leadership role that they took after the tech bubble.”\n\nSome pockets of opportunity\n\nStill, some argue that tech will bounce back in 2023. But investors may need to look beyond the FAANGs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and other megacaps.\n\n“Tech is not a monolith. We believe cybersecurity and robotics have the potential to buck the economic cycle given cybersecurity has moved from niche to necessity and robots are mission-critical in fighting supply chain challenges, labor shortages and inflation,” Jay Jacobs, US head of thematics and active equity ETFs, said in a report.\n\nBlackRock (BLK), the owner of the popular iShares family of ETFs, recommends several of its own sector funds as a way to play these trends, including the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech (IHAK), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (IRBO), BlackRock (BLK) Future Tech, iShares Evolved U.S. Technolog (IETC)y and iShares Semiconductor ETFs.\n\nShawn Cruz, head trading strategist at Charles Schwab (SCHW)-owned TD Ameritrade, said tech investors are flocking more to cybersecurity since it’s a must have for corporations, regardless of economic conditions, given high profile hacking incidents.\n\nCruz said that there are some parts of tech that are trading at more “frothy” valuations. But cybersecurity stocks such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), as well as semiconductors, are more reasonable.\n\nIn other words, tech investors should be looking tor more boring parts of the sector, not assets like crypto that are more about hype than substance. Cruz said that winners in tech are not going to be those with the next great idea or app. It’s about providing a service that businesses will need even if the economy slides into a recession.", "authors": ["Paul R.

Both names often take center stage, but it's quite rare to see Musk and Nvidia in the same sentence.\n\nBut on Dec. 2, a report by DigiTimes suggested that Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, xAI, struck a major deal with Nvidia.\n\nBelow, I'm going to break down what's been reported so far and assess how a partnership between xAI and Nvidia could be a major catalyst for the semiconductor darling.\n\nWhat did Musk do now?\n\nPerhaps the hottest piece of infrastructure for generative AI development is the graphics processing unit (GPU). GPUs are chipsets that are capable of running extremely sophisticated algorithms at ultra-high speed around the clock.\n\nIndustry estimates suggest that Nvidia holds 88% of the GPU market — absolutely dominating the sector. With such enormous scale, it should come as no surprise that Nvidia's GPUs are used by many of the world's largest enterprises including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla.\n\nAccording to DigiTimes, Musk was involved in a deal between xAI and Nvidia — reportedly personally contacting Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang and offering more than $1 billion for a cluster of GB200 GPUs.\n\nWhy this deal is so important\n\nAs it relates to xAI specifically, take a look at what Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) back in September.\n\nxAI is already working with Nvidia, specifically on the buildout of its supercomputer, dubbed Colossus. Moreover, Musk drops more than a few breadcrumbs suggesting that xAI will be doubling down on AI infrastructure sooner rather than later.\n\nConsidering xAI already snubbed Oracle earlier this year, I think Nvidia has a great opportunity to continue working alongside xAI — underscored by the new GB200 deal.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities is one of the most respected technology analysts on Wall Street. Ives recently wrote on social media that he sees more than $1 trillion of AI infrastructure spend during the next three years.\n\nGiven Nvidia's existing footprint in the AI infrastructure landscape, there's an argument to be made that the company will capture much of this incremental capital expenditure (capex). However, this may not end up being the case in the long run.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nDespite its first-mover advantage in the GPU realm, direct competition from Advanced Micro Devices in combination with internal competition from its own customers leads me to question how much more Nvidia can really accelerate its growth.\n\nAs I've said before, I see Nvidia continuing to be a major pillar supporting the broader AI narrative for years to come. But as alternative GPUs come to market — presumably at lower prices — Nvidia's ability to compete will become challenging. In other words, GPUs are going to become relatively commoditized and Nvidia's hand is going to be forced at some point. Simply put, billion-dollar deals with the world's most captivating AI businesses are a luxury, not a norm in perpetuity.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Musk's choice to use Nvidia products for xAI's computing infrastructure speaks volumes to the quality of the company's GPUs. While I'm encouraged by the relationship between xAI and Nvidia, this deal alone does not make the stock a buy. Even though Nvidia is well positioned to capture incremental market share as AI infrastructure investments rise, I remain cautious about the company's long-term prospects.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Chien Chih-Hung/Office of The President/Getty Images\n\nThe self-governed democratic island of 24 million people is a global leader in the supply of semiconductor chips, which are a vital component for virtually all modern electronics, from cars to refrigerators to mobile phones.\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that it would suspend imports of grapefruit, lemons, oranges and other citrus fruits, as well as chilled white striped hairtail and frozen horse mackerel from Taiwan.\n\nIn a separate statement, Chinese customs officials said the import suspension of citrus fruit is a result of “pest control” and “excessive pesticide residues,” and cited “Covid prevention” for the suspension on seafood imports.\n\nChina’s commerce ministry, meanwhile, suspended exports of natural sand to Taiwan, a key component for the production of semiconductor chips.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has triggered the expected ire of Chinese authorities,” said analysts from ING Group on Wednesday.\n\nIn response, Taiwan officials said China’s sand export suspension would have a “limited” effect and that Chinese sand accounts for “less than one percent” of its total demand.\n\nChina has previously banned imports of some Taiwanese products amid escalating tensions. Last year, China banned imports of pineapples from the island followed by some types of apples later in the year citing “pest control.” Earlier this year, it also banned Taiwanese grouper fish, a high-value seafood product from Taiwan, citing detection of some banned drugs.\n\nBeijing’s recent announcements coincide with Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, the first visit by a sitting speaker in 25 years, and after Beijing issued stern warnings that it would take countermeasures in retaliation.\n\nThe country’s military said after Pelosi’s visit that it was launching a series of “targeted military operations to counteract the situation.”\n\nAt a press briefing on Wednesday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “the US and Taiwan separatist forces must take the responsibility and pay the price for the mistakes they made.” Her comments came after she was asked whether the latest export suspension are intended to punish Taiwan for Pelosi’s visit, which she declined to answer directly, saying “please ask relevant department in charge.”\n\nPelosi’s visit comes at a tense moment for China.\n\nThe Communist Party will undergo a leadership reshuffle at its 20th party congress this fall. President Xi Jinping is expected to seek a historic third term in power at the meeting.\n\nDomestic tensions are high as the country’s economy has slipped to the lowest growth in more than two years amid rigid Covid lockdowns and a slumping property market. Youth unemployment has soared to the highest on record. Social protests are rising because of a nationwide mortgage crisis and a series of rural bank scandals.\n\nImpact on global supply chains\n\nTraders and analysts are worried about an escalation in China-Taiwan tensions and their impact on the global supply chain and inflation outlook.\n\nGlobal markets tumbled Tuesday, with major stock indexes closing in the red and safe-haven currencies surging. On Wednesday morning, Asian markets rebounded a bit, but risk sentiment remains muted.\n\n“China’s response to Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan could have an impact on supply chains and demand, which could keep the inflationary pressures going strong,” said Edward Moya, senior market strategist for Oanda, on Wednesday.\n\nGlobal supply chains have already been rattled by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The World Bank said recently that many countries are experiencing double-digit inflation.\n\nAny conflict in Taiwan, which is key in supplying the world with semiconductors, could exacerbated the global chip shortage that has already strained the global auto industry. The Taiwan Strait is also an important shipping lane for vessels carrying goods between Asia and the West.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips and plays a critical role in powering products designed by tech companies like Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia.\n\nIn an interview with CNN this week, TSMC chairman Mark Liu said a war between China and Taiwan would make everyone lose. “If you take a military force or invasion, you will render TSMC factory not operable,” he said.\n\nTSMC is one of Asia’s most valuable companies, and accounts for 90% of the world’s super-advanced chips.\n\nEurasia Group analysts, meanwhile, expected Beijing to conduct an “unprecedented” show of military force in the Taiwan Strait, along with cyberattacks, economic sanctions, and diplomatic protests.\n\n“The immediate effect on clients will be a moderate but likely temporary disruption of supply chains that traverse the waters around Taiwan, as planes and ships reroute to avoid [People’s Liberation Army] exercises,” they said in a report on Wednesday.\n\n“The lasting impact” will depend on the duration and intensity of the episode, though at the very least it will prompt further planning and contingencies around supply chain disruptions, including for semiconductors, by firms and policymakers, they added.\n\n“The potential for crisis may not abate soon,” they said, adding that China could unveil further responses in coming days, weeks, and even months as the 20th party congress approaches.\n\nCNN’s Simone McCarthy, Akanksha Sharma and Wayne Chang in Hong Kong contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2022/02/18/gm-stock-value-tesla-ford-rivian/6803498001/", "title": "Barra ready to prove GM stock is as valuable as Tesla", "text": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra is masterful at masking what must be an annoying question she is regularly asked.\n\nIs GM stock undervalued?\n\nIn short, she has said, yes, it is.

England ultimately won back-to-back titles after defeating Spain via a penalty shootout, but Carter's celebration was cut short. She opted to skip England's parade in London to return to the states ahead of Gotham's match Friday.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder to have been part of this England team,\" Carter wrote on Instagram after their Euro 2025 victory. \"Gotham has quickly become a family and a team to me that I truly enjoy being part of so coming back to them straight away to prep for our upcoming game was a decision I made myself.\"\n\nAs action is set to get underway in the NWSL, here are four burning questions going into the second half of the season:\n\nWho leads MVP race, will it overlap with the Golden Boot?\n\nEsther González is leading the 2025 Golden Boot Race and shows no signs of slowing down. González has a league-leading 10 goals in 13 games, becoming the fastest player in Gotham history to reach double-digit goals in a season. She was named the player of the month twice this season and has been pivotal to her team's success. Gotham is fighting to stay in playoff contention and is 5-1-0 this season when González scores.\n\nThe Golden Boot winner has won the NWSL MVP award in every season but one since the league began play in 2013. (Lindsey Horan was named the 2018 MVP, while Sam Kerr won the 2018 Golden Boot.) So it's safe to say González leads the MVP race as well, but she will face stiff competition down the stretch.\n\nKansas City Current forward Temwa Chawinga and Orlando Pride forward Barbra Banda are right behind González with eight goals each. Chawinga won the 2024 NWSL Golden Boot and MVP after becoming the first player in league history to score 20 goals in a season. If Chawinga repeats, she'll be the first player to win multiple Golden Boots since Sam Kerr won three consecutive (2017-2019).\n\nNWSL stars shine on international stage: Who competed?\n\nThe NWSL not only features the best players in the country, but the best players in the world as evidenced by international competitions held this summer, including the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025, the Women's Africa Cup of Nations and the 2025 Copa América Femenina.\n\nEsther González was the top scorer of the UEFA Women’s Euro in Switzerland, scoring four goals for Spain across six matches. Despite Spain leading the tournament in goals (18), possession (65.8%), passing accuracy (88.5%) and attempts (147), the Spaniards lost to England, which featured Gotham defender Jess Carter, Orlando Pride goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse and Washington Spirit defender Esme Morgan.\n\nIn addition to González, five other NWSL stars found net during the Women’s Euro 2025: San Diego Wave forward Delphine Cascarino scored two goals for France, Utah Royals midfielder Janni Thomsen scored for Denmark, Seattle Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock for Wales, Angel City FC forward Sveindís Jónsdóttir for Iceland and Chicago Stars defender Natalia Kuikka for Finland.\n\nThat same weekend, Nigeria won its record 10th WAFCON title in a comeback 3-2 victory over host Morocco. Bay FC forward Asisat Oshoala and Houston Dash forward Michelle Alozie were part of Nigeria's championship team.\n\n\"I love seeing fellow NWSL athletes here represented in WAFCON,\" Alozie told ESPN on July 24. \"It is so important to see that African players are excelling in the NWSL, and then coming and excelling at WAFCON, just like Banda and Racheal Kundananji have shown.\"\n\nOrlando Pride forward Barbra Banda and Bay FC forward Racheal Kundananji each scored three goals for Zambia in the tournament.\n\nThe 2025 Copa América Femenina champion will be crowned on Saturday when Brazil faces Colombia in the final. Brazil's national team includes Pride forward Marta (one goal) and midfielder Angelina, Gotham FC forward Gabi Portilho, Current goalkeeper Lorena and Racing Louisville FC forward Ary Borges. Colombia's national team includes Racing Louisville FC centre-back Ángela Barón, Washington Spirit midfielder Leicy Santos (one goal) and San Diego Wave FC centre-back Daniela Arias.\n\nCan anyone catch the Kansas City Current?\n\nThe Kansas City Current sits atop the standings and are clear favorites to win the NWSL Shield, which is awarded to the team with the best regular season record. Kansas City is eight points ahead in the standings and has the highest goal differential (19), in addition to a perfect 6-0 record at home.\n\nThe defending champion Orlando Pride (25 points) are in second place, followed by San Diego Wave (24 points) and Washington Spirit (23 points).\n\nA NWSL Shield doesn't equate to a NWSL Championship by any means. Since the league began play in 2013, only three teams have won the shield and championship in the same season, most recently the Pride in 2024.\n\nWill Trinity Rodman return to the Spirit?\n\nThe Spirit are likely to have a boost in the second half of the season as forward Trinity Rodman nears a return. Rodman has been limited to four matches (one start) this season due to a chronic back injury that left her \"in pain all the time,\" but the Olympic gold medalist is training with her team again.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be back and actually in team trainings and not coming back on the side from step one,\" Rodman told reporters on Tuesday. \"I'm still gonna be Trin. But, I think the way that I would throw my body around [before], maybe not. Maybe just being smarter about certain tackles, certain runs, certain 50-50s.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Despite coming into the game with multiple defenders injured or suspended, Germany seemed like they might have just enough to spring an upset over an opponent that has strolled through Euro 2025 without being seriously tested.\n\nHowever, Bonmatí — who was hospitalized before the tournament with a case of viral meningitis — conjured up the game's only goal in the 113th minute, producing a stunning turn before firing an angled shot that caught goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger by surprise.\n\n\"We deserve it,\" Bonmatí told reporters after the game, per Reuters. \"We've had a brutal championship. But we've also had a great tournament so far until today.\"\n\nMORE SOCCER: Latest news from around the football world\n\nBerger, who has been one of the best players at Euro 2025, took responsibility for the goal that ended Germany's run.\n\n\"The near post had to be covered, that's clear, and that’s why I’m even more disappointed in myself,\" said the NJ/NY Gotham FC star. \"I can make as many saves as I want, but that goal should have simply been mine, and that’s why I feel incredibly sorry, not even for myself, but for the team, because they really gave everything.\"\n\nSpain's prize for winning is a trip to Sunday's final in Basel, where England awaits in a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final.\n\nSpain vs. Germany Euro 2025 highlights\n\nSpain vs. Germany: Spain advances to Euro 2025 final\n\nDon't let the lack of goals fool you: that was one of the best games of Euro 2025, with Spain finally finding the solution against a remarkably dogged defensive performance from Germany.\n\nAitana Bonmatí's clever goal on the turn in the 113th minute gave Spain a 1-0 win, with Germany simply not having any gas left in the tank to push for a comeback. Germany would have been favorites had it gone to penalties, but ultimately Spain did enough to deserve their place in Sunday's final.\n\nSpeaking of: that game will be a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final, with Spain taking on England at St-Jakob Park in Basel. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET, with Fox broadcasting the match.\n\nGoal Spain! Aitana Bonmati strikes\n\nSpain finally has the breakthrough, and it's the multi-time Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmatí breaking the deadlock in the 113th minute.\n\nBonmatí produced a stunning turn to surprise the German backline, but it looked for all the world like she would only have a chance to blindly fizz a low cross into the goalmouth and hope for someone to get a touch. However, the Barcelona superstar may have seen the tiniest opening at the near post, zipping what turned out to be a surprise shot past Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nBerger has been arguably the best player at Euro 2025, but being beaten near post is going to haunt her unless Germany can find a late goal.\n\nSpain vs. Germany: 0-0 at halftime in extra time\n\nGermany is hanging on by their collective fingertips, but they found just enough in the tank to keep Spain at bay through the first 15 minutes of extra time. Germany did have one attacking chance in the early seconds of this extra time period, but simply didn't have enough energy to execute correctly.\n\nSince then, it's been all Spain, and head coach Christian Wück only has one substitution window left after being forced to remove Sophia Kleinherne due to what looked like two separate injuries incurred making a single tackle.\n\nSpain vs. Germany: 0-0 at full time, extra time has begun\n\nSpain and Germany are producing a classic in terms of tension, with the latter very nearly stealing a win in the final seconds of regulation. Cata Coll's late reaction to a deflected shot was followed by an excellent save on the rebound, keeping Spain alive just before the full-time whistle.\n\nThe goalkeepers have made the biggest plays in this game, which despite a lack of goals has been played at a very high level. We're looking at 30 more minutes of play.\n\nSpain vs. Germany: Euro 2025 semifinal back underway\n\nGermany has kicked off against Spain as the second half begins.\n\nNeither team has made a substitution, though it looks like a few Germany players are putting their shinguards in to prepare for a serious warm-up. Given that Spain has had so much of the ball, it would make sense that German starters might start to run out of gas.\n\nSpain vs. Germany: Euro 2025 semifinal scoreless at halftime\n\nThe first half of this semifinal has been poised on a knife edge, but Spain and Germany walk off with the score 0-0 at Stadion Letzigrund.\n\nSpain has dominated the ball to an almost comical degree, seeing 78% possession, but Germany knew from kickoff that they would be playing to frustrate the World Cup champions before hitting back on the counter. Despite being short-handed at the back and seeing multiple players need treatment during the first half, Germany has created some really good looks, capitalizing on some lackluster spacing from Spain.\n\nThat said, Spain has created most of the danger, and Ann-Katrin Berger has once again had to perform at the absolute top of her game. La Roja have fired 12 shots, forcing Berger into five saves and seeing one Irene Paredes header slap off the post. None of Berger's stops were better than a 21st-minute robbery of her NWSL teammate Esther González.\n\nSpain vs. Germany: Euro 2025 semifinal kicks off\n\nSpain gets this massive game going, with Germany immediately setting up in a compact 4-2-3-1 formation. Based on Germany's defensive absences, we might see a lot of that dynamic as long as this game stays scoreless.\n\nSpain vs. Germany time: Euro 2025 semifinal\n\nThe Euro 2025 semifinal between Spain and Germany kicks off at 3 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nHow to watch Spain vs. Germany: TV channel, live stream\n\nTV channel : Fox\n\n: Fox Streaming: Fubo\n\nSpain lineup\n\nSpain is nearly at full strength, but they have had to replace defender Laia Alexandri (suspension) with María Méndez.\n\nElsewhere, look out for arguably the two players putting the best bids to claim the Player of the Tournament award, with NJ/NY Gotham FC's Esther González leading the Golden Boot race and playmaker Alexia Putellas showing her best form in years.\n\nGermany lineup\n\nGermany is facing a difficult situation at the back, where injuries and suspensions have depleted head coach Christian Wück's options. The good news is that Carlotta Wamser, who was suspended for Germany's dramatic win over France, is back and has been reinserted into a starting role.\n\nThe bad news? Sarai Linder (ankle) is the latest player to succumb to injury, joining captain Giulia Gwinn (knee) on the sidelines. Meanwhile, center back Kathrin Hendrich and the versatile Sjoeke Nüsken are both suspended, leaving Germany with a makeshift defense against what is arguably the world's most formidable attack.\n\nSpain vs. Germany odds: Women's Euro 2025\n\nOdds via BetMGM\n\nRegular time result : Germany +425 // Draw +350 // Spain -190\n\n: Germany +425 // Draw +350 // Spain -190 To advance: Germany +250 // Spain -375\n\nGermany's comeback win vs. France provides gameplan\n\nGermany's gritty win over France has given the team a template for how they should play for the rest of the tournament, defender Rebecca Knaak told reporters on Tuesday ahead of her side's Women's Euro semi-final against Spain in Zurich.\n\nThe Germans had a player sent off and conceded a penalty early on against the French, but recovered to draw 1-1 after extra time and win the quarter-final shootout, pitting the eight-times champions against Spain on Wednesday.\n\n\"Really, it's the perfect example for passion, strength, mental strength, all these things that are characteristics that we possess,\" defender Rebecca Knaak told a press conference.\n\n\"Of course, on a tactical basis, we are prepared by the coach and the team, but the basic, fundamental characteristic has been built for the Spanish (game) in the French match.\" – Reuters\n\nSpain ready to finally beat Germany\n\n\"I think they are also another team, they have another coach, but Germany is Germany and they have eight European Championships,\" Spain coach Montse Tome said. \"Their essence is the same, regardless of who is in charge, and we are very clear about the game we want to play tomorrow, how we want to condition it and where we want to take it.\"\n\nSpain won their three group stage games by a combined score of 14-3 before defeating a spirited Swiss side 2-0 in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"My feelings are good, full confidence in what we are creating, in the mentality we have, in the game we have played throughout the European Championship,\" Spain midfielder Alexia Putellas said. \"It will be a very tough game, like any semi-final of a major tournament, but with maximum enthusiasm and maximum motivation to move forward and make history once again.\" – Reuters\n\nUEFA Women's Euro champions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957514/england-win-womens-euros-best-reactions-videos-celebrations", "title": "England win the Women's Euros: best reactions, videos and ...", "text": "The Queen led the plaudits as England beat Germany 2-1 after extra-time to win the 2022 Uefa Women’s European Championship – the Lionesses’ first major international trophy.\n\nAt a packed Wembley Stadium, the host nation battled hard against a talented German team and took the lead after 62 minutes when substitute Ella Toone scored a stunning chip.

Like we said in our private email, we’ve maintained, continue to maintain and will continue to maintain an unquestionable commitment to the Spanish national team,” the 2021 Ballon d’Or winner.\n\n“That is why we request in our letter to the RFEF not to be called up to the national team until it remedies the situations that affect our mental and personal wellbeing, our performance, and in consequence, the results of the of the national team that could lead to undesirable injuries.

We should all listen.”\n\nRFEF appears to be standing by the coach. The federation said it will not “allow the players to question the continuity of the national coach and his coaching staff, since making those decisions does not fall within their powers.”\n\n“The federation will not admit any type of pressure from any player when adopting sports measures. These types of maneuvers are far from exemplary and outside the values ​​of football and sport and are harmful,” it added.\n\nRFEF said that the players would not be allowed to return to the national team unless they “accept their mistake and ask for forgiveness.”\n\nIn her statement, Putellas disagreed with the RFEF’s assertion that the players were calling for changes in the national team coaching staff.\n\n“We’ve never asked for the dismissal of a coach as has been reported,” the two-time Best FIFA Women’s Player award winner wrote.\n\n“We understand that our job is not in any case to decide that position, but we can express, constructively and with honesty, what we believe can better the performance of the team,” she said.\n\nThe revolt is a high risk move for the players.

A swashbuckling road to the final included a Euro-record 22 goals scored and just two conceded, an 8-0 demolition of world No. 11 Norway and a 4-0 dismantling of the world’s second-highest ranked team Sweden.\n\nWith head coach Sarina Wiegman having never lost a European Championship game – nor a game in charge of England – and Germany having never lost a Euro final, one record had to tumble at Wembley, the site of an agonizing defeat for the men’s team at the same stage just over a year ago.\n\nAnd despite only beating Germany twice in their previous 27 meetings, Wiegman’s players battled to a hard-fought victory to extend the Dutch coach’s impressive streak and spark scenes of pure, unbridled joy at the home of English football.\n\nThat euphoria was encapsulated by the celebrations of the matchwinner, who offered up one of the great post-match interviews when she spoke to the BBC.

As a young girl watching women’s football, this is amazing. Thank you to everyone who played a part in my rehab. I always believed I would be here.”\n\nCaptain Leah Williamson added: “I just can’t stop crying. We talk, we talk and we talk and we finally done it … this is the proudest moment of my life.\n\n“The legacy of this tournament is the change in society. The legacy of this team is winners and that is the journey. I love every single one of you, I’m so proud to be English.”\n\nVictory marked the culmination of a 13-year-long redemption arc for midfielder Jill Scott, the only member of the Lionesses squad to have featured in the 6-2 mauling suffered at the hands of Germany in the 2009 final.\n\nSubbed on towards the end of regular time, the 35-year-old became the first England player to have played in two major international finals.\n\n“I actually can’t believe it,” Scott said. “We have an incredible group of staff. What a day. The young players have been fantastic, so grateful for every moment of this team.\n\n“I don’t think I’m going to sleep this week!”\n\nEngland fans watching the game and celebrating in Trafalgar Square in London. Matthew Horwood/UEFA/Getty Images\n\nAs congratulations poured in across social media, men’s captain Harry Kane tweeted his appreciation, with particular praise for Toone, whose deftly chipped finish had put England ahead in the second-half.\n\n“Absolutely unreal scenes at Wembley!! Massive congrats to the amazing Lionesses,” Kane said. “Ella Toone take a bow for that finish too.”\n\nThere was also a message of congratulations from Queen Elizabeth II, who lauded the team for inspiring the next generation.\n\n“The Championships and your performance in them have rightly won praise,” she said. “However, your success goes far beyond the trophy you have so deservedly earned.\n\n“You have all set an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women today, and for future generations. It is my hope that you will be as proud of the impact you have had on your sport as you are of the result today.”\n\nInjury agony for Popp\n\nGermany was struck a heartbreaking blow moments before kick-off when star striker Alexandra Popp, joint-top scorer at the tournament with six goals, suffered a muscle injury in the warm-up.\n\nReplaced in the starting 11 by Lea Schüller, it marked a devastating end to what had been a heartwarming redemption story for the 31-year-old. After missing the previous two Euros through injury, Popp had made up for lost time emphatically, matching the record for best goal tally at the tournament – set by compatriot Inka Grings in 2009 – with a game to spare.\n\nPopp’s visible anguish as she left the pitch served as a stark contrast to the euphoric atmosphere of a sold-out Wembley Stadium as kick-off edged closer, with singers Becky Hill, Steflon Don and Ultra Naté taking to the center circle to host the pre-match show.\n\nWith the surrounding area of the ground teeming with fans and flags several hours before kick-off, it was a fitting build-up to the close of a tournament that had smashed records well before the trophy had been lifted.\n\nThe total of 487,683 fans that had attended the games preceding the final more than doubled the previous tournament attendance record set at Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.\n\nAnd that was before the historic numbers boost at Wembley, which smashed the existing high for a men’s or women’s Euro final set at Madrid’s Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in 1964.\n\nIt was a record-breaking attendance for a European Championship final -- men's or women's -- at Wembley on Sunday. Rui Vieira/AP\n\nBuoyed by home support, England started on the front foot. Fran Kirby carved out an early chance with a teasing cross for Ellen White at the back post, but the Manchester City forward could only direct her header into the arms of Merle Frohms.\n\nIt would mark the first of a string of opportunities for White in a cagey first half of few gilt-edge chances, with both defenses continuing the iron-fisted form that had seen them arrive at Wembley having conceded just once all tournament.\n\nAggravated by a quick succession of yellow cards for Georgia Stanway and White, frustration quickly turned to fear for England as a flicked on corner caused carnage on the goal line. Pinballing around inches from the line, the ball looked destined to settle in the net before it was gratefully smothered by England keeper Mary Earps.\n\nDealing with players’ complaints would set the tone for a busy day for referee Kateryna Monzul, who dished out six yellow cards and stopped play for 36 fouls throughout a combative, hard-fought contest.\n\nEngland’s best chance of the half came five minutes before the break as a cut back from Beth Mead found White surging into the box, but the off-balance 33-year-old couldn’t keep her shot down.\n\nEcstasy\n\nIt was Germany’s turn to fly out of the blocks following the restart, with Tabea Wassmuth almost punishing Millie Bright for a miscommunication just two minutes into the second half. But having raced away down the left, Wassmuth could only fire her shot straight at Earps.\n\nWiegman rang the changes as Germany continued its fast start, Kirby and White making way for Toone and Alessia Russo. With four goals – all from the bench – Russo had been the tournament’s unofficial ‘golden’ sub before the final, but it was Toone who would steal the crown at Wembley.\n\nAfter a perfectly weighted long ball from Keira Walsh split the German defense, the Manchester United attacker found herself in the clear, faced by the onrushing form of Frohms. Her response? The most exquisite of chips that lifted over the goalkeeper and in.\n\nKelly scoring England's Euro-winning goal in the final against Germany at Wembley Stadium on July 31. Julian FinneyThe FA/Getty Images\n\nIf the finish was deft, the response was anything but, as Wembley erupted in ecstatic scenes not witnessed under the arch since Luke Shaw’s strike had fired the men’s team into an early lead at the opposite end of the pitch just over a year ago.\n\nLike so many England tournaments before, that story ended in tears, and another painful chapter looked on course to be penned when Magull fired home a deserved equalizer 10 minutes from time.\n\nWith Wiegman’s side dropping ever deeper to protect their advantage, the pressure finally broke when a well-worked move saw Wassmuth slide a low cross into the Bayern Munich midfielder at the near post, who smartly poked into the roof of the net to level.\n\nMagull went close again in a nail-biting finish to regular time, with the euphoric atmosphere mere minutes ago replaced by one of nervous tension, broken momentarily by a rousing reception for the introduction of Scott.\n\nGermany players celebrate Magull's equalizer. Leila Coker/AP\n\nHomecoming\n\nTempers flared during a nervy extra-time of few chances and many crunching tackles, with Scott involved in an angry exchange with Sydney Lohmann after she had tripped the German.\n\nAs legs tired and penalties crept closer, England forced a corner with 10 minutes to play. Lucy Bronze knocked the ball down into the path of Kelly who, after one missed swipe, poked the ball over the line for her first international goal at the most timely of times.\n\nCue pure bedlam, momentarily frozen by Kelly pausing to check with referee Monzul that her goal had counted. Ripping off her shirt in celebration, the 24-year-old was issued with what will surely be the most warmly received yellow card of her career.\n\nDogged efforts to keep the ball in the corner ran down the clock as the Wembley crowd willed their players over the line, Monzul’s final whistle sparking the biggest roar yet.\n\nRight on time, “Three Lions” blasted through the stadium speakers.

Around 87,000 fans are set to be at the home of English football, which would smash the current attendance record for a Euros final – men’s or women’s – of 79,115, set at the 1964 final between Spain and the Soviet Union at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nUEFA, European football’s governing body, says nearly 100,000 children have attended matches so far at Euro 2022, while 47% of all fans have been women.\n\nOf course, it certainly helps that home fans have been fortunate enough to watch arguably the most talented England women’s side of all time.\n\nThe 8-0 dismantling of a dangerous Norway side, ranked just two places below England, and the 4-0 drubbing of Sweden, the second-best team in the world and a team England had previously beaten just three times, will go down as some of the most eye-catching in the Lionesses’ history.\n\nBut the path to the final wasn’t always a straightforward one.

Germany boasts a quite extraordinary record in the European Championship, winning eight of the 12 editions that have been contested and reigned over the Euros crown for 22 years until defeat at the quarterfinal stage in the Netherlands five years ago.\n\nHead coach Sarina Wiegman, who guided her native Netherlands to victory at Euro 2017, is well aware of how important an England win on Sunday could be for women’s football in the country.\n\n“I think we have been an inspiration for the country already,” she told reporters on Friday, per Reuters. “You know when you win a major tournament it really makes a difference and that would make me very proud. But I don’t think further than that. Most of the time you don’t realise the impact until probably 15 years later.\n\n“We approach this game exactly the same as every other game we have played. We don’t talk about the rivalry between England and Germany; we want to show how good we are and play our best game.\n\n“There’s so much eagerness in this team to win, and so much resilience. We want so badly to show again we are the best and to play our best game. That’s what we’ve been trying to do all the time and then hopefully, that will bring us to win.”\n\n‘Nothing left to lose’\n\nAlexandra Popp, who has become Germany’s star with six goals in five games at these Euros, is one of the best feel-good stories of the summer.\n\nThe 31-year-old missed the Euros in 2013 and 2017 through injury and, for a while, it looked as though she might miss this one after injuring her knee last year, but Popp was finally able to compete when the tournament was postponed by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShe has certainly made up for lost time and was visibly emotional after scoring in the opening win against Denmark, sinking to her knees and covering her face with her hands.\n\nAlexandra Popp's six goals at Euro 2022 equals the all-time record at a single tournament. Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nPopp’s six goals at Euro 2022, matched only by England’s Beth Mead, equals the previous best goal haul at a single Euros, set by compatriot Inka Grings at Finland 2009.\n\n“I think the pressure is more on the English side, precisely because it takes place in their own country,” Popp told reporters at a press conference on Friday. “We know that from 2011 [when Germany hosted the World Cup], suddenly everyone expects something from you.\n\n“We have nothing left to lose. With that attitude we can go into the game completely free.”\n\nThere certainly seem to be no nerves in the German camp ahead of the final, with Popp turning up to the press conference wearing a mustache hidden under her mask. “Hello,” she said, greeting reporters in a gruff voice.\n\nAfter her match-winning performance against France in the semifinals, German outlets FUMS and Der Postillon ran satirical posts saying that men’s national team head coach Hansi Flick had called up a new striker for Qatar, accompanied by a photo of Popp in a mustache with the pseudonyms Alexander Bopp and Alexander Papp.\n\nThe forward will no doubt be the biggest threat England faces on the Wembley pitch come Sunday and it’s likely a moment of instinct from Popp or Mead could decide the game.\n\nThese two teams boast a brilliant defensive record at this tournament, having each conceded just one goal, and it’s likely their stingy back lines will be difficult to breach in the final.\n\nAlexandra Popp wore a fake mustache to her pre-match press conference on Friday.

England is doing exceptionally well. I saw three games of Germany, they’ve been doing really well as well. It’s a really good final – two intense teams facing each other.\n\n“As much as I love England, in this specific case my heart is on the German side, but the better team might win and I’m completely fine with that. At a sold out Wembley with an English crowd, it will be a massive challenge for Germany.\n\n“Most important is the face women’s football showed, it’s a fantastic game. Women’s football, over the last few years, exploded in their development. It’s tactically and technically on an incredibly high level. The intensity of the games – physically it’s really, really good and I love watching it.\n\n“England are slight favorites playing at home, but Germany has a chance.”\n\nAfter defeat in the men’s Euros final last summer, England fans will be desperate to avoid double heartbreak.

There was “absolute mayhem”, as Lucy Bronze and Mary Earps danced on the table and the rest of the Lionesses “paraded around the room”.\n\nThe joyous scenes on the pitch, in the dressing room and in the press conference proved how big a moment this was for women’s football in the country.

Now unbeaten in 20 games since taking charge last September, she has “moulded England into an impressively ruthless outfit”.\n\nAfter winning the Euros with her native Netherlands in 2017, the 52-year-old has become the first coach to win consecutive championship titles with two different countries, said Jamie Spencer on 90min.com. She boasts a “perfect record” of 12 wins from 12 games at the Euros – six with the Netherlands in 2017 and now six with England this summer. Her time with the Lionesses has been “nothing short of incredible”. She has quickly put her stamp on an “already talented squad that had started to underachieve in the years since 2019”.\n\nShe may be a “tough taskmaster”, whose “eyes can spit fire”, but the “laser-focused” coach gets results with her “bold” changes to the team during a match, said Adam Shergold in the Daily Mail. Never afraid of “making big calls”, the “character” and fighting spirit instilled in the team by Wiegman has come “to the fore”.\n\nEngland are unbeaten in the 20 games Wiegman has been in charge (Image credit: Lynne Cameron/The FA via Getty Images)\n\nA ‘bumper’ new contract?\n\nThe “mastermind” behind England’s success, Wiegman will be in “high demand” ahead of next year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup, said Jeremy Cross in the Daily Star. Wary that she could be “lured away” at some stage, the English Football Association is expected to open contract talks “in a bid to secure her long-term future”. Wiegman will “pocket a £200,000 bonus” for winning Euro 2022, said Ben Willcocks in the Daily Mail. Despite having two years left on her current £400,000-a-year deal, she is also “in line for a bumper new contract”.\n\nEngland defender Rachel Daly believes Wiegman should be recognised as one of Europe’s best coaches – in women’s or men’s football. “She’s incredible,” the full-back said. “She’ll never take any credit but you can see how she influences us. She’s a calming presence on the bench, on the sidelines, in the changing rooms, in training. She’s one of a kind and we’re so lucky to have her.”\n\nThere’s no doubting Wiegman’s impact on the women’s team in England. But for the supercoach herself, she believes the performances of her players will contribute much wider than just sport. “This tournament has done so much for the game but also for women in society,” she said. “I don’t think we’ve really realised what we’ve done. Over the whole tournament we’ve had so much support from our fans. We did an incredible job and I’m so proud of my team.” At the end of her press conference, Wiegman had the final say with three words: “We changed society.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/football/england-usa-womens-soccer-wembley-spt-intl", "title": "European champion England to host US in women's soccer match in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs teams prepare for the 2023 World Cup, newly crowned European champion England is scheduled to host the United States at Wembley Stadium in London on October 7.\n\nEngland is still celebrating a thrilling 2-1 extra-time victory over Germany at Wembley on Sunday in front of a European Championship record crowd of 87,192, but they still have work to do in World Cup qualifying, as group play comes to an end next month.\n\nThe Lionesses have two matches in September to secure a finals bid: September 3 at world No. 21 Austria or three days later at home vs. No. 113 Luxembourg.\n\nA tie or win at Austria would put them through as would a win at home against Luxembourg. But if Austria passes England on points then the match against the US would be rescheduled as the Lionesses would be forced into a two-match playoff to make the World Cup.\n\nThe two-time defending champion United States has qualified for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand through its performance at the Concacaf W Championship in Mexico last month.\n\n“To get a chance to play the European champions in London at Wembley is an opportunity that doesn’t come around very often, so we’re all thankful that the match could be arranged, and we’ll be hoping that England finish their qualifying campaign in September,” US Women’s National Team head coach Vlatko Andonovski said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of match we need at exactly the right time in our World Cup preparations so we can test ourselves against a very talented England team. I saw England play live at the Euros, and I’m looking forward to an amazing atmosphere at Wembley and another big event for women’s soccer on October 7.”\n\nEngland head coach Sarina Wiegman said the match against the US is a very exciting opportunity.\n\n“It would be the perfect game for our squad to meet another strong team after so many tough games in the EUROs,” she said. “It is good we enjoy the moment we are in after this wonderful summer, but we know we still have to work to do to take the next step forward.”\n\nThe two teams met in the semifinals of the 2019 World Cup in France with the US winning 2-1 as one of the US goal scorers, Alex Morgan, celebrated her strike with a tea-sipping mime.

It is my hope that you will be as proud of the impact you have had on your sport as you are of the result today.”", "authors": ["Steve Almasy Jacob Lev", "Steve Almasy", "Jacob Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}]}

Cloth diapers or disposable? What kind of childcare might I need?\n\nBecome a new mom during a pandemic and those questions get even tougher.\n\nShould people be vaccinated before meeting my baby? Is daycare even safe? Can my mom hold the baby – just for a few minutes so I can shower?\n\n“You have enough pressure of ‘I’m home with the baby, now what do I do with this thing?’” said Sarah Joyce, who gave birth to daughter Leah in August. “Then, you’re making all these decisions that no one has dealt with the last 100 years. There aren’t a lot of resources.”\n\nMother's Day: What you need to know to celebrate Mom this weekend in the Columbus area\n\nIn many instances, these new mothers and their partners were forced to handle the sleepless early days and nights of infanthood alone as some doctors told couples to isolate themselves for two weeks after leaving the hospital. It left some struggling to figure out how to keep their baby safe from COVID-19 while preserving their own mental health.\n\nStill, as some central Ohio women celebrate their first Mother’s Day today, they can’t help but feel grateful for some of the silver linings the pandemic brought them: more bonding time with baby, being present for important milestones and even some mornings to sleep in with no commutes or places to be.\n\n“We’ve bonded so much,” said Heather Sheppard, who has been working from home since she returned from maternity leave after having her daughter Stella in August. “I have a feeling for her routines and schedule that wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t there.”\n\nThings to do in Columbus: Brunches, concerts and shows offer Mother's Day weekend fun\n\nWhen Stella rolled over for the first time, Sheppard, 30, of the North Side, was able to run from her desk to where her own mother was watching the baby in another room and capture that priceless moment.\n\nJoyce, 36, of Westerville, has had similar moments.\n\n“I’ve had a ton of time with her that I wouldn’t have gotten otherwise,” said Joyce, who works for an event production company and would have put Leah in daycare months ago if it wasn’t for the pandemic. “I can’t complain about that. In fact, I wouldn’t change that for the world.”\n\n'Happy tears'\n\nWhen Meredith Miller goes to church today for a Mother's Day service and a child hands her flowers — a tradition at the church — she knows she'll get emotional. Her son Henry was born in February with the help of in-vitro fertilization and after a three-year struggle with infertility.\n\n“There will be tears this Sunday,” the 36-year-old Johnstown resident said. “But they will be happy tears. I will finally get to celebrate Mother’s Day.”\n\n'Dear Mom': Mindy Drayer pens new book as ode to mothers everywhere\n\nThat’s something she wasn’t sure would happen this year after the pandemic hit and fertility clinics shut down in March 2020 for several months. That happened just days after her egg retrieval but before her embryo transfer. Instead, her embryos were frozen for three months while she waited for her doctor’s office to reopen.\n\nShe had mixed feelings about that.\n\n“Our embryos were safe and waiting for us,” Miller said. “But at the same time, we’d been trying for three years and we felt like we were at the finish line of some point. There are no guarantees with this, but putting everything on pause was disappointing and frustrating.”\n\nWhen the fertilized egg was finally transferred, her husband wasn’t allowed to attend the procedure.\n\nThere were other signs that this journey into motherhood wasn't quite typical: no baby showers, no family members commenting on her growing belly and no ultrasounds with her husband in tow.\n\nThat loss of normalcy carried into other areas for pandemic moms.\n\nJoyce lamented celebrating her baby’s first Thanksgiving and Christmas without family to hug her little one, while others missed having photographers or doulas in their delivery rooms.\n\nRob Oller: Moms deserve a special something for doing everything for their young athletes\n\n“There was frustration and this tension, because stores could be open, but my husband couldn’t come to the anatomy scan with me,” said Eva Hummel, who gave birth to her son Jet in July.\n\nAs an extrovert, Hummel, 30, of the North Side, said it was difficult to be cooped up in the house with a new baby and few people with whom to share the excitement of his arrival. Only her parents were able to hold him for at least that first month.\n\nWhen she did begin allowing more people to interact with Jet, Hummel, an infectious disease nurse at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, said she was thankful for the emphasis on illness-mitigating measures the pandemic has created.\n\n“People have been way more cautious washing their hands, wearing masks, not going near a baby if they’re sick,” Hummel said.\n\nAnd as the first of her friends to have a baby, she felt free to revel in all her son’s special moments – saying \"mama\" for the first time, pulling himself up – instead of feeling like she might be missing out on cookouts, parties and other gatherings.\n\n“We had less events to miss,” Hummel said. “Everyone was in the same boat staying home.”\n\nAppreciating the isolation\n\nFor 38-year-old new mom Christina Crump, the pandemic was helpful in another way — she sees it as the reason she finally became a mother.\n\nShe said that all the extra time spent at home is exactly what prompted her and her husband, Kenneth, to have a baby.\n\nAs busy owners of small businesses that were unexpectedly shuttered at the beginning of the pandemic — she had a salon and he runs a children’s gym — the Franklin Park couple, who had been together 19 years, decided the time was finally right.\n\n“We weren’t doing anything else, and we had been talking about it loosely,” she said.\n\nFlower shortage: Why your Mother’s Day bouquet might be more expensive\n\nWhen her daughter Karlo arrived in December, she said the most difficult part was not having visitors – besides her parents – for two or three months.\n\n“We had a lot of support but not a lot of people coming into the house to help,” Crump said. “Calling is not enough. It was just him and I trudging it out through the trenches.”\n\nEven that had a silver lining, though, as it allowed them to become closer as a couple, another sentiment echoed by other new moms.\n\nMadison Eagle, 28, of Westerville, who had her son Graham Eagle-Shendo in August, acknowledged another side benefit of all the isolation for her and her husband, even if it meant that Graham hasn't met his great-grandfather or cousins yet.\n\n“I was grateful for that privacy” she said. “We were able to be alone with our baby and take care of each other in a quiet, relaxing space of recovery.”\n\nFinally doing what normal moms do\n\nWith the arrival of vaccines and warmer weather in central Ohio, Mother’s Day just might signal a change to more typical times for new mothers. Health guidelines are loosening and some say they're feeling more comfortable going out socializing and allowing others to hold their babes to give them a break.\n\nThe anxiety about keeping their babies safe from the pandemic have eased a bit.\n\n“I’m hoping, especially as summer is coming, that I’ll have plenty of time with him to do normal things moms do, like go to the zoo and not have to worry about large crowds,” Miller said.\n\nSheppard said she’s also excited to learn more about who she is as a mom outside of the context of a once-in-a-century global health crisis.\n\nBut even as she's glad to see signs that the pandemic is improving, she appreciates how it's made her and other moms more willing to speak up about their struggles and ask for help when they need it.\n\n“It’s super hard to be a parent, and no one ever talks about it,” Sheppard said. “People are talking about it now. That’s a positive.”\n\naward@dispatch.com\n\n@AllisonAWard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/08/10/hepatitis-vaccine-outbreak-spreads-shadows-opioid-epidemic/1967284001/", "title": "Hepatitis A vaccine: Outbreak spreads, shadows opioid epidemic", "text": "AKRON, Ohio — Just before the Fourth of July, Trenton Burrell began feeling run-down and achy. Soon he could barely muster the energy to walk from one room to another. A friend shared an alarming observation: “You’re turning yellow.”\n\nWithin days, the 40-year-old landed in the hospital, diagnosed with the highly contagious liver virus hepatitis A, which has infected more than 3,220 people in Ohio and killed at least 15.\n\nSince 2016, the virus has spawned outbreaks in at least 29 states, starting with Michigan and California. It’s sickened more than 23,600 people, sent the majority to the hospital and killed more than 230. All but California’s and Utah’s outbreaks are ongoing, and experts expect to eventually see the virus seep into every state.\n\nHepatitis A: Florida health officials declare public health emergency\n\nHomeless are suffering: Risk of hepatitis, typhus and other diseases is growing\n\nLike a shadow, it follows the opioid epidemic, spreading mostly among drug users and the homeless. But anyone who hasn’t been vaccinated can get hepatitis A — as Akron health officials are now finding out.\n\n“It’s getting into the general public,” said Tracy Rodriguez, communicable disease supervisor for Summit County Public Health. “It’s scary.”\n\nHepatitis A thrives in unsanitary conditions and spreads as easily as a stomach virus: People ingest minuscule amounts of an infected person’s stool from food, drinks, drug equipment or objects as commonplace as doorknobs. Burrell, who used to live in a tent but now stays at a friend’s house, believes he contracted the virus cleaning up trash left by fellow drug users without wearing gloves. More than two weeks after his hospital stay, he described still feeling weak and “worn out” visiting friends near the spot in Akron where he once pitched his tent.\n\nThe virus has stricken more people in Ohio than any other state but Kentucky, where it infected more than 4,800 people and killed at least 60. Kathleen Winter, a University of Kentucky epidemiologist, said more populous Ohio is on pace to surpass it as her state’s outbreak wanes.\n\nRelentlessly, the virus continues its march across the nation. Pennsylvania declared an outbreak as recently as May. In early August, Florida and Philadelphia declared public health emergencies, which, among other things, signal to health care providers the need to vaccinate the vulnerable. Case counts now exceed 1,000 in six states.\n\nAnd as in Akron, the virus reaches beyond homeless people and drug users. One in five Kentuckians sickened from August 2017 through mid-2019 fit neither group. Nearly 40% of Florida’s cases from 2018 and the first half of 2019 had no or unknown risk factors.\n\nHepatitis A contamination: Kroger recalls frozen berries after FDA warning\n\nSimon Haeder, an assistant professor of public policy at Pennsylvania State University, said the outbreaks show how the addiction crisis and the diseases it fuels endanger everyone, while also revealing cracks in the nation’s patchwork, poorly funded public health system. A recent report by Trust for America’s Health found only 2.5% of U.S. health spending in 2017 went to public health.\n\n“We have growing homeless and drug-using populations. We have a decreasing investment in public health. It doesn’t make me optimistic looking into the future,” Haeder said. “Once you reach a critical mass, eventually everyone is fair game.”\n\nThe power of a vaccine\n\nHepatitis A, which infects liver cells and causes inflammation, can be mild or severe, and in rare cases leads to liver failure and death, especially in older people and those with other liver diseases. There’s no cure; doctors advise rest, nutrition and fluids as it runs its course.\n\nCases dropped dramatically in the United States after a vaccine came out in 1995. The shots are recommended for babies, and federal figures from 2016 show 61% of children 19-35 months had gotten both of two doses. Only 9.5% of adults 19 and older had gotten the shots.\n\nWith so many unprotected adults, the disease roared back in 2016. Public health workers fought it by vaccinating those at greatest risk. In California’s San Diego County, they also opened hand-washing stations and distributed hygiene kits containing hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes, bottled water and other items. They even washed down streets with a bleach solution.\n\nThe next year, outbreaks appeared in five more states, including Kentucky, where it would ultimately metastasize into the nation’s largest.\n\nThe virus crept into neighboring Ohio in 2018, gradually infecting people in all but seven of 88 counties. By early this month, 111 cases had been reported in Summit County, among the state’s highest tallies.\n\nRodriguez and her colleagues in the northeastern Ohio county have mounted an all-out assault. They have administered more than 550 vaccinations, targeting people at the county jail, syringe services programs, drug treatment centers, post-incarceration support groups and homeless communities. When they identify cases, they work to find and vaccinate their families, friends and close contacts. Sage Lewis, an advocate for the homeless who owns land where a tent city once stood, said “the health department is saving lives.”\n\n'Too low and too slow': Kentucky's response to the nation's worst hepatitis A outbreak\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Rodriguez and fellow health department nurse Rachel Flossie vaccinated 26 participants of a post-incarceration reentry program run by South Street Ministries. Participants lined up quickly to get their shots, some wincing at the prick of the needle.\n\nJessica Gilbert, 33, got her second dose of vaccine. She’d had her first in late May, providing most of her immunity. But she wanted to be extra cautious because she believes she may have been exposed by another woman in jail in a nearby county.\n\n“I want full protection,” she said. “I don’t want to be sick.”\n\nBut health officials don’t reach everyone at risk. Some drug users are so focused on their next fix they don’t worry about protecting themselves from the virus. Many dealing with unstable housing or addiction are hard to find.\n\nBurrell said he never heard of hep A before he got it. Although he knew not to share drug equipment when he cooked crystal meth, he said, he didn’t think about the dangers of touching dirty needles or other trash. Burrell now warns others to be careful, and spreads the word about vaccination.\n\nPublic health nurse Yvonne Demyan does the same when she brings vaccines to a syringe services program in a strip mall health department office.\n\nAfter vaccinating two other clients on a recent afternoon, Demyan stepped into the waiting area and asked a client: “Your turn?”\n\nBefore he could reply, she answered for him: “Yes. Would you rather be sick for a month? Because that’s exactly what’s gonna happen if you get hepatitis A.”\n\nWave of illness rolls on\n\nNews coverage in some places highlights infected restaurant workers, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said transmission to restaurant patrons has been “extremely rare” during these outbreaks because of sanitation practices such as washing hands and wearing gloves.\n\nControlling the virus has proven especially challenging in rural areas, where there are fewer services such as homeless shelters and homelessness can mean couch-surfing with friends. Many small towns have small health departments, with just a couple of nurses and declining budgets. A 2018 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials found 23% of local health departments serving populations under 50,000 — and 19% of all local health departments — expect budget cuts in the next fiscal year.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the CDC has injected federal resources. The agency spent roughly $9.1 million in fiscal 2018 to help curb outbreaks, which includes money for 150,000 federally funded vaccines.\n\nDr. Monique Foster, medical officer in CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis, said vaccinating those at highest risk remains the best strategy. “Outbreaks will stop when we have effectively vaccinated the vulnerable people,” she said.\n\nAlthough the federal government isn’t recommending universal vaccination, several experts said the more people vaccinated, the better.\n\n“The risk is there. The disease is circulating,” said the University of Kentucky’s Winter. “It’s good for the general public to be vaccinated.”\n\nWith the virus continuing its advance, Penn State’s Haeder said, “it won’t be long before we have it everywhere.”\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

It can range from a mild ailment lasting a few days to a severe illness lasting several months. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, diarrhea, clay-colored stools, joint pain and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Symptoms usually last less than two months, although they can last as long as six months in some people.\n\nHow does it spread?\n\nThe virus usually spreads when someone unknowingly ingests it from objects, food or drinks contaminated by minuscule amounts of stool from an infected person. It can also spread during close personal contact with an infected person, such as through sex or when caring for someone who is ill.\n\nWho’s at risk?\n\nAnyone can get hepatitis A, but people at higher risk include those with direct contact with someone who has it; people who use drugs (injected or not); people who are homeless or have unstable housing; men who have sex with men; and travelers to countries where the virus is common.\n\nWho should be vaccinated?\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccinating at-risk groups as well as those more likely to suffer complications from hepatitis A, 1-year-olds and “any person wishing to obtain immunity.” The committee recently voted to extend its recommendations to children ages 2-18 who missed the vaccine as babies.\n\nHow is the infection treated?\n\nThere’s no medication or cure; the virus must run its course. Doctors usually treat symptoms and recommend rest, adequate nutrition and fluids. Some people need to be hospitalized. In rare cases, hepatitis A can be fatal, especially when it strikes older people or those with existing liver disease.\n\nHow is hepatitis A different from other types of hepatitis?\n\nHepatitis A, B and C are caused by different viruses. Hepatitis B is primarily spread when blood, semen or certain other body fluids from an infected person enters someone else’s body. Hepatitis C is spread via blood. Hepatitis B or C can range from mild illnesses, lasting a few weeks, to serious, chronic conditions. There are vaccines for hepatitis A and B, but not hepatitis C.\n\nSources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/27/when-you-find-out-your-mothers-fertility-doctor-ithe-doctor-helped-women-conceive-but-he-lied-them-h/577701001/", "title": "When you find out your mother's fertility doctor is likely your ...", "text": "Most of them believed for decades that an anonymous sperm donor, a medical resident or dental student, was their biological father. A few thought the fathers who raised them had contributed half their genes.\n\nNow about 20 of those people, most of whom live in Indiana, believe they most likely have the same biological father: the Indianapolis fertility doctor who treated all their mothers.\n\nFor Julie Harmon and her parents, who always thought that the man who raised her was her biological father, the revelation has been nothing short of devastating.\n\n“It’s hard for me to fathom that somebody can do this and basically get away with this,” said Harmon, 35, of New Palestine. “He took away the ability for my dad to have a biological child.”\n\nThat man, Dr. Donald Cline, is expected to face a pretrial hearing in Marion County this fall on charges of obstruction of justice that accuse him of misleading investigators from the Indiana attorney general’s office by denying that he used his own sperm to inseminate patients.\n\nCline has pleaded not guilty. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nA probable cause affidavit filed last year asserts that he told one of his biological daughters that he felt pressured to use his own sperm when he did not have access to donor sperm. He told some of the siblings he was just trying to help people have babies.\n\nThe children who believe they were conceived via the doctor’s sperm have been waiting for months for court action. Some have come forward to publicly share their stories.\n\nBreaking the news\n\nAfter learning Cline likely was her biological father, Harmon said she cried every day for four months. The most difficult day was when she told her father a genetic test had linked her as a half sibling to the several others likely conceived with Cline’s sperm.\n\n“It was the worst thing I ever had to do in my entire life. It makes me cry now. It was horrible,” she said. “He was speechless, devastated. He still to this point can’t really talk about it.”\n\nHarmon and her mother spoke with detectives on Cline’s case, but they said they were told no other charges can be brought against the 78-year-old doctor because his patient records no longer exist. Still, she and others would like to see him at least stripped of his medical license and come forward to share what happened so many years ago.\n\nWithout modern genetics tests, Cline’s source for sperm could not be determined. But sites such as 23andme.com, which performs DNA testing, and the Donor, Offspring, Parent & Sibling Registry, which connects gamete donors to offspring, helped Jacoba Ballard and seven other siblings connect a few years ago. Soon, they suspected something was awry.\n\nNot only did they share genes, they learned, but a common story of origin. Cline had promised each of their parents he would use sperm from an anonymous donor and that that sperm would be used no more than three times to conceive a child.\n\nIn 2016, DNA sites provided a clue that that sperm donor might not have been anonymous at all: One of Cline’s first cousins was identified as a close relative.\n\nEventually Ballard and a few other siblings met with Cline and they say he admitted he had used his own sperm at least a few times.\n\nHow many times, they asked. His answer vacillated, Ballard said. At first he said seven to 10 times and then 50.\n\nSeeking the truth, Ballard, 37, kept pushing Cline for a precise count.\n\nEventually, she and the others came into contact on their own with a total of up to 20 people who say they believe Cline likely is their biological father.\n\nNow. Ballard worries that her half siblings or their descendants might unwittingly meet, date and marry. The knowledge that more siblings could be out there still haunts her and the others.\n\n“I don’t want a relationship with him, but I want the truth,” she said. “I’m mad at the fact that I share DNA with somebody that cannot tell the truth, because that is not me.”\n\nIn late 2014, Ballard and some other siblings filed a complaint with the Indiana attorney general’s office, which conducted an investigation. In letters sent to investigators, according to court records, Cline denied ever using his own sperm.\n\nGrowing evidence\n\nTwo years later, Ballard shared her story with Fox59. The reporter reached out to the Marion County prosecutor’s office, which decided to take a closer look and submit Cline to a paternity test, according to court records.\n\nDNA swabs showed more than a 99 percent certainty that Cline was the biological father of Ballard and one of her newfound siblings.\n\nOther doctors have been accused of similar acts over the years. In 1992, a Virginia doctor was convicted of fraud and perjury for lying to patients he inseminated with his own sperm. The doctor was linked to 15 individuals, but prosecutors said he might have fathered as many as 75 children.\n\nNo laws exist to specifically prohibit doctors from inseminating patients with their own sperm. Ballard and some of her siblings would like to see such a law passed here, but they have had no success so far in persuading lawmakers.\n\nNor is there much information whether such situations have a long-term, detrimental impact on the children who discover the truth.\n\nBut it is clear that it will have at least some impact, agree experts like Janet Malek, an associate professor of medical ethics and health policy at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n“The big thing is that it disrupts their narrative and sense of identity. They have this story they have told themselves,” she said. “This changes your self image. It’s like finding out your mother was raped.”\n\nMatt White, 34, never had any interest in finding his biological father. But after seeing a news account about the Cline case, he grew curious, knowing that his mother had seen the doctor before his birth. He said DNA test results showed Cline was most likely his biological father.\n\nThat knowledge changed White's life.\n\n“It’s hard to not get consumed about it, especially at the beginning. It’s really all I thought about. … No one will ever understand unless you live through it,” he said. “For four to six months, I walked around town, since I live in this community, saying, ‘Hmm, do you look like me? Could you be my brother or sister?' That’s a real, real possibility.”\n\nNow, he talks with some of his newfound sisters often. Other siblings have been less interested in a relationship. New siblings still crop up. Cline has four children with his wife.\n\nFace to face\n\nA few months ago, White attended a hearing for Cline, along with some of his siblings and his mother, Liz. Neither of them spoke to the man.\n\n“It was the first time in my life that I had both biological parents in one room,” said White, whose own two children were conceived through donor sperm. “I don’t know if I have a good answer for you why I went. Maybe curiosity.”\n\nHis mother Liz White had met Cline before, several times, but wanted to support her son and the other children. She had no kind words for a man who was once known as one of the best fertility specialists in Indiana.\n\nBy the time White made it to Cline’s office, she had seen five other specialists, all of whom had used frozen sperm. She and her husband had started the process to adopt.\n\nThe idea of an anonymous donor appealed to White, 29 at the time and now 65. She liked the fact that she wouldn’t know who he was and he wouldn’t know who she was. That anonymity offered both sides protection, she thought.\n\nFor five months, she visited Cline’s office. Only once did she see another person, another patient in the waiting room. Each time, Cline would set her up in an exam room, leave the room and come back in a few minutes with a filled syringe. She never questioned what he might be doing in that other room\n\nToday, she considers it a \"virtual rape.”\n\nDianna Kiesler, Harmon’s mother, now questions everything that Cline told her more than three decades ago and the many times she recommended him to friends suffering from infertility. After about a year of seeing Cline with no results, she and her husband decided to adopt again. At that point Cline told her about a new approach.\n\nShe started taking a new drug. For the next three months, Cline artificially inseminated her, with what he told her was both her husband’s sperm and that of an anonymous donor. Later, he told her he was using just her husband’s sperm. So when she found out she was pregnant a few weeks later, she assumed from the start her husband was the biological father.\n\n\"Even after I had Julie, I took her back in to show him my daughter because I was so happy that I had finally had a child by my husband,” the New Palestine resident said. “I showed Julie off to him, never once thinking I was showing her off to her father.”\n\nHer daughter, Julie Harmon, had an inkling something about her genetics didn't add up. She knew that her blood type could not belong to a child who was the progeny of a mother and father with the blood types her parents had. Originally, she chalked up the discrepancy to confusion on her parents’ part.\n\nLast fall, though, Harmon saw some of her half siblings on television and noted a resemblance. She messaged Ballard on Facebook, who urged her to take a DNA test. It showed that Harmon was closely related to Ballard and the others.\n\nThe news shook Harmon, but it has not disrupted her relationship with the man she always thought was her biological father, the man who raised her and will continue to be her father.\n\nOver time, Harmon has reconciled herself to the likelihood that Cline, if convicted, would serve no jail time, given his age and the charges.\n\n“I just want the justice system to be fair and for him to know that this is not okay and that he has destroyed a lot of lives by doing this,” she said. “What I want first and foremost and above all else, an apology, an apology to my parents, to my dad.”\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Shari Rudavsky at (317) 444-6354.

Paul and James McElwain are a DJ duo unofficially embraced by the right and seeking to infuse more fun to politics.\n\nThe two have been involved in DJ event production for around a decade under the name “Milk N Cooks.” Paul said they entered the politics afterparty production scene after noticing a “gaping hole” in fun parties and entertainment surrounding the often intense and contentious political realm.\n\nServers wore tank tops with “No tax on tips” printed across their chests, a Republican Party talking point earlier in the day. About 100 people crowded around the bar around 10 p.m.\n\nPaul said he hopes the event brings people together.\n\n\"We lean a certain way, but we're not explicit about that and it's just, hey, we're trying to put on a good event for people to want to hang out, have good time and socialize,” Paul said.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nMichigan Rep.

Employees at several restaurants said a variety of factors beyond the RNC — the early weekday, humidity and rain — could have played a role in reducing foot traffic.\n\nAt Cafe Benelux, an employee said the number of diners was “significantly” lower than a normal Monday night.\n\nAt the Milwaukee Public Market, stools at the Tiki Bar were mostly filled. An employee said traffic was about what he’d expect.\n\nCity Social employee Jeloni Woulard also said business was normal for a Monday.

Van Orden said Vance's upbringing and commitment to serving voters who live in rural areas or below the poverty line will offer a balance to the Republican ticket, contrasting Trump's billionaire status.\n\n\"If you look at that, that's an expression of the American dream,\" he said. \"People are going to gravitate towards that.\"\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nLocal government leaders decry Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal government leaders from across the U.S. gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to highlight the importance of the level of government closest to the people.\n\n“America’s mayors are driving solutions at the local level,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who was joined by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Rancho Cordova, California, Mayor David Sander and New York City Council member Joseph Borelli.\n\nThe group said whether Trump or President Joe Biden wins a second White House term, local governments will need a strong partnership with the federal government to address challenges in communities.\n\nJohnson pointed to the federal pandemic aid that reached local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act, saying it helped prevent Milwaukee from becoming insolvent and gave Wisconsin’s largest city the time it needed to reach a funding agreement with the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nSander, who is also president of the National League of Cities, called the attempted assassination an “attempt to murder democracy.”\n\n“That violence is a reminder of the responsibilities we all have as leaders to create stronger communities and to act swiftly to disavow hate and violence wherever we find it,” he said. “It was a reminder quite frankly of what our fellow mayors and council members and aldermen have known for way too long: that hate and violence toward elected officials in our country has been rising and it must end.”\n\nLeaders, he said, must “model better ideals for our democracy.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nFire and medical personnel field heat exhaustion calls\n\nA man experiencing what a police officer said was heat exhaustion got help from Milwaukee police and medics around 5:40 p.m. near the corner of State and Water streets as vehicles entered the convention perimeter.\n\nTemperatures in Milwaukee reached the upper 80s Monday. With the high humidity, the heat index reached around 92 degrees.\n\nAs of 6:30 p.m., fire and medical personnel have responded to a dozen heat-related calls, according to Milwaukee Fire Department Lt. Carlos Velazquez Sanchez.\n\n— Drake Bentley, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nLiz Truss, former UK prime minister, is attending the RNC\n\nLiz Truss, the former Conservative Party prime minister of the United Kingdom, is at the RNC.Truss posted a photo of herself in front of Fiserv Forum on X, formerly Twitter, Monday afternoon.\n\n“Great to be at @RNC in Milwaukee seeing President Trump get nominated,” she said in the post. “The leadership the West needs.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Truss is expected to speak at the event.\n\nFollowing an assassination attempt on Trump, Truss encouraged her 666,400 X followers to pray for the former president and America. She later took to X again to call Trump “the strength the world needs.”\n\nTruss was a member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in various capacities from 2010 to 2024. Earlier this month, she lost her seat in Parliament in the U.K. general election.\n\nIn 2022, Truss resigned around a month and a half after becoming UK prime minister, making her the shortest-serving UK PM, BBC reported.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Cory Booker meet with high school students\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke with a group of high school students at the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Monday afternoon, listening to stories of why investing in the arts should be more important for the federal government.\n\nThe two also weighed in on Trump’s vice presidential selection in the hours after the announcement.\n\nBaldwin said that Trump’s selection of Vance was an “expected choice in many ways.” She said she’s worked to author legislation with Vance, but said that Democrats now have to keep the focus on their values.\n\n“What we have to keep the focus on is the difference between what Democrats stand for and our ticket,” she said. “And what (Republicans) stand for, Project 2025 is extremely scary. And voters need to know that they have a real choice.”\n\nBooker echoed that sentiment.\n\n“They don’t stand with the values of the majority of American people when it comes to things like health coverage, with reproductive rights,” he said. “So this is going to be a very clear choice.”\n\nThe senators also addressed the growing amount of political violence in America, which culminated in former president being shot Saturday.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nInterview with Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\nChurch flies LGBTQ+ Pride flag as message of love\n\nJust a couple of blocks east of Fiserv Forum at Village Church, Pastor Donna Brown and congregants hung up an LGBTQ+ Pride flag outside the front of the unassuming building.\n\n“We’re called to be inclusive and loving,” Brown said. “Anybody is welcome in, even if they don’t agree with us.”\n\nShe and four members of the church were laying out food and drinks inside the building, preparing for the rescheduled gathering. It’s a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America denomination with a special designation to welcome LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nEarlier, she had placed a sign in large font on the front door reading “No Weapons Allowed.\"\n\n“We don’t feel violence is an answer,” Brown said. “More weapons cause more violence.”\n\nLifelong Milwaukeean and member of the church Bill Koehn, 73, said security and the events of the last 48 hours were the main topics of conversation at the church’s Sunday service.\n\n“The bottom line is we are all about spreading the message of love and we don’t discriminate,” Koehn said.\n\nGesturing to the flag, he said: “If somebody has an issue with this being displayed or the fact that there is a church right here, on whatever level, that’s why we have our doors open so we can sit down and have a dialogue like this and get the opinions from people.”\n\nWhile he lamented Milwaukee's failed DNC in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Koehn said he was “OK” with the convention being in Milwaukee, especially the economic benefits and how it highlights the city of Milwaukee “in a way that doesn’t happen very often.”\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nMan disrupting protesters arrested by Milwaukee police\n\nA 36-year-old man was arrested Monday afternoon after disrupting protesters during the end of a march at Red Arrow Park, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nAuthorities say the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at the park, 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nMilwaukee police said the man was arrested, cited and later released.\n\nThe video of the incident, which was posted on X, has more than 6,000 views:\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nTrump cereal for sale\n\nCrosswords lovers can have a Trump-themed start to their morning with a MAGA-branded cereal available for sale.\n\nIn the “soft” pedestrian zone, Milwaukee residents Crystal King and another person employed by the Trump campaign hung up posters advertising Trump cereal boxes that promises “greatness in every bowl.” They said it tasted like Fruity Pebbles.\n\nBoxes are $30 a pop, or $20 if you’re willing to forgo the cereal inside it.\n\n“Missing those lively family discussions? Trump Cereal is your new table centerpiece,” the website says. “It's not just about the crunch, but the conversations it sparks — from light-hearted banter to deep political chats.”\n\nThe crossword puzzle on the back includes phrases like “fake news,” “crooked Hillary” and we won’t spoil the rest.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nCanary Coffee seeing more customers 'for a Monday'\n\nCanary Coffee, just outside the hard security perimeter at 720 N. King Dr., saw an uptick in business on the first day of the convention.\n\n“A lot more business than normal for a Monday,” said employee Josh Beamsley, adding the customers are not their normal clientele.\n\nIn preparation for the big week Canary Coffee stocked up on extra ingredients including double the amount of milk it normally has.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nResearchers surveying protesters for study on contemporary U.S. politics\n\nStudent volunteers were surveying protesters at Red Arrow Park on Monday afternoon to understand why people choose to protest and the impact protests may have on contemporary politics in the U.S. The survey is funded and led by Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nMichael Heaney of the University of Glasgow and his team have surveyed about 140 people at the RNC in Milwaukee so far. He’s also surveyed protests at previous RNC and DNC conventions in 2008 and 2016. In comparison to previous RNC protests, this year’s is less organized and smaller, Heaney said, possibly due to the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n“It may make the protests smaller because people are nervous about political events. I would project marginally smaller and marginally more intense protests,” he said.\n\nSasmit Rahman, 22, and Emily Chu, 22, traveled to from Minneapolis to march on the RNC. Rahman said they are looking forward to the results of the survey specifically around race and gender of protesters. Chu is interested to learn how people’s emotions may push them to attend protests.\n\n“I think it’s interesting to see whether it’s fear or hope that motivates people more,” Chu said.\n\n— Gina Castro\n\nNorth Carolina delegate loves Trump’s VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina delegate Pauline Bruno gushed about Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\n“We are so pleased,” she said in a seersucker blazer and Trump-printed shoes she bought on Etsy.\n\nBruno loved Vance’s focus on the Rust Belt in his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that she read two years ago.\n\nMilwaukee has been “so welcoming,” she said. She praised the police and said she had “no concerns” about security.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nGuests and delegates appeared to be in high spirits as they wandered downtown Milwaukee after the first afternoon of the convention.\n\nAsif Shahzada, a Wisconsin delegate and La Crosse resident, said the energy was “wonderful” inside Fiserv Forum when Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“I love Trump’s policies,” Shahzada said. “Everybody is energetic. It’s fun to meet other delegates.”\n\nShahzada, who recently immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan, is attending the RNC for the first time this year and said he’s already met people from at least five other states. He owns and operates The Sushi Pirate, a restaurant in downtown La Crosse.\n\nFor other convention-goers, it’s far from their first rodeo: Floyd Brown, a Phoenix resident, said he’s attended every RNC since 1984, save for the mostly virtual convention during the pandemic.\n\n“The party is more unified than I’ve seen in decades,” Brown said after the delegate roll call. “It’s more somber this year, but people are also very upbeat.”\n\nBrown, who is an invited guest at the convention, is also a political commentator and author of “Counterpunch,”a 2023 book advocating for peaceful resistance against leftist movements. He said he feels the Republican party has unified in the face of rising political division, especially given the assassination attempt on Trump just days before the convention.\n\nBrown is attending the RNC with his wife, Mary Beth, who said she was excited by Trump’s announcement of Vance as his running mate this afternoon.\n\n“I think he’s going to do an excellent job,” Mary Beth Brown said of Vance.\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nBobby Flowers, florist at Marius Bell Floral & Design, arrived at the Milwaukee Public Market around 11 a.m., and as of 5:30 p.m. said he's never seen the market so empty on a Monday.\n\n\"It's been dead,\" he said. \"There's usually a lot of tourist traffic here on Mondays, and it's just been so quiet today. It feels so strange.\"\n\nAs of 6 p.m., only eight patrons were seated in the market's upstairs dining area with roughly 20 to 30 patrons shopping or dining on the main floor. Five open tables were available at St. Paul Fish Co.\n\nOutside at the St. Paul Palapa tiki bar, all bar stools were occupied.\n\n— Rachel Bernhard\n\nA photo posted on X shows British comedian and actor Russell Brand, a Trump supporter and conservative internet personality, walking around downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe post says he was seen taking photos with fans and police officers near the Baird Center.\n\nBrand is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts music recital hall, and at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield on Wednesday.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke Monday evening called the Coalition to March on the RNC protest “extremely smooth and safe.”\n\n“I was really pleased with everyone, I think globally,” said Goyke, who observed the march on the first day of the Republican National Convention. “We had protesters and counter protesters. Everyone that was here seemed well organized, there was communication, law enforcement were everywhere they needed to be, communicating with individuals.”\n\nHe said he and his staff would be out in the coming days as well to monitor areas people are expressing their First Amendment rights and how government responds if an incident does occur.\n\nHe also said he got to talk with the Columbus Police Department’s 13-member Police Dialogue Team that was also out at the protest.\n\nIt’ll be interesting, he said, to see whether Milwaukee pursues a similar team at its own police department.\n\n“It’s a special team with training and background to go into protests or potential civil unrest, these kind of emotion-filled environments, and I thought they did a great job today,” he said.\n\nCommunication ahead of time helped ensure everyone was on the same page, Goyke said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nPopular Wisconsin beer sparks political discussion\n\nSpotted Cow, the beer from the New Glarus Brewing Company, prompted the start of a discussion about the beer and its place in Wisconsin culture and politics.\n\nPolitico correspondent Adam Wren reported that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told a passerby that Spotted Cow is pretty good, “but the owner is ultraliberal. Leinenkugel’s is the conservative one.”\n\nHowever, social users have also made their opinions on the beer and the senator’s criticism.\n\nJournalist Robert Evans said that Wisconsin should be proud of Spotted Cow.\n\n“My primary takeaway from the Milwaukee RNC: Spotted Cow is an excellent beer, shocked by how good it is,” Evans said in an X post.\n\nX user Josh Geise (@joshgeise) said, “Was at Kohler this weekend. Had my first Spotted Cow. So glad to hear it’s ‘ultraliberal.’”\n\nAnother X user, Chaddy (@brewcity43) said, “Spotted (C)ow is okay, and (Leinenkugel’s) is average, as well.”\n\n– Angelika Ytuarte\n\n50 Cent will not attend the RNC, rep says\n\nFollowing reports that rap icon 50 Cent was in discussions with Republican officials about appearing at the convention, his representatives told TMZ that he will not be attending.\n\n\"He is not attending (the RNC), as he is slated to be in Shreveport preparing for his ‘Humor and Harmony’ festival,” his rep said\n\nThe business mogul, born Curtis Jackson, made a post on X on Saturday of his iconic 2003 album cover but instead replaced himself with Trump.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse looking for patrons\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse setup a pop up Beer Garden just outside of the hard security zone and not many people have shown up throughout the first day of the convention.\n\n”I think the security measures are more restrictive than we anticipated so it’s really difficult for people to get here,” Brent Brashier, owner of Doc’s Smokehouse, said.\n\nHe added there is an exit right in front of the beer garden but not many are going through that way.“Not really anybody knows it’s an exit because it’s padlocked,” Brashier said.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nModel Amber Rose spotted around Milwaukee\n\nMilwaukeeans have seen popular model and TV star Amber Rose around the city in recent days after she announced last week she would be a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter spotted the model, rapper and television personality eating at the Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar in downtown Milwaukee Sunday afternoon. Fans gathered around the model and took photos with her, including one resident who snapped a selfie with Rose outside the restaurant.\n\nThe popular television personality has been trending on social media following her announcement back in May that she was in support of former President Donald Trump. Rose announced on July 8 on X that she would be a speaker for the RNC.\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Quinn Clark\n\nJason Storms criticizes Republican Party's abortion stance\n\nJason Storms, national director for Operation Save America, appeared outside the Marcus Center around 5 p.m. to criticize the Republican Party for not taking a stronger stance on abortion.\n\n“We’re committed to the protection of preborn children,” said Storms. Storms was scheduled to speak at Haymarket Square at 4 p.m. but relocated because it was deserted.\n\nWhen the Republican Party finalized its platform this week, it did not include language calling for a national ban on abortion.\n\nThe platform stated: “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those rights.”\n\nAccording to its website, Operation Save America argues a “biblical worldview must govern all areas of both our private and public lives.” It is known for displaying graphic images of aborted fetuses as part of its anti-abortion advocacy and has stated that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty. Storms is the son-in-law of anti-abortion extremist Matt Trewhella.\n\nStorms was accompanied by several of his teenage children, who held large banners with anti-abortion imagery and quotes from the Bible.\n\n— Alex Groth and Cleo Krejci\n\nAttendee mixes RNC with her bachelorette party\n\nTemperatures have remained steadily in the high 80s across Milwaukee’s downtown.\n\nAnd as the afternoon has chugged along, Milwaukee’s Deer District has started to fill out with delegates, guests and volunteers spilling out from Fiserv Forum, seeking out cooling refreshments at local establishments like freshly opened New Fashioned, and its veteran neighbors, The DW Pub and The Mecca.\n\nConservative nonprofit Turning Point Action blasted out from speakers, ringing loudly throughout the plaza, discussing the recent pick of J.D. Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\nFor Texan delegate alternate Rachel Sikes, it’s where she’ll celebrate her bachelorette party as the table calls for more cheese curds at The New Fashioned\n\n“It was just happenstance,” she said.\n\nShe’s getting married July 27. So far, they’ve enjoyed drinks on Lake Mendota in Madison, where they're staying.\n\nShe said she was OK with the vice presidential choice.\n\n“It wasn’t my first choice, but I support the president,” she said.\n\n— Vanessa Swales and Jordyn Noennig\n\nSenate candidate Rejani Raveendran campaigns at Red Arrow Park\n\nRejani Raveendran, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, was introducing herself to people in Red Arrow Park Monday afternoon to encourage them to vote for her in the Republican Party primary election Aug. 13.\n\nRaveendran was the first Republican candidate to challenge Tammy Baldwin, and will run against Eric Hovde inthe GOP primary. A U.S. citizen who immigrated from India and lives in Stevens Point, Raveendran worked as a nurse and is now at UW-Stevens Point, earning her degree in political science.\n\nShe said she's concerned about food and gas prices, border security and homelessness.\n\n“I just want to do what I can because I do not trust any politicians,” she said.\n\nRaveendran said she wasn't invited to speak at the convention and has received several phone calls from Republican leaders, asking her to step down and support Hovde.\n\n“I said I cannot do that, because I do not want to betray the people,” Raveendran said.\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Gina Lee Castro\n\nWisconsin Republican Chairman Brian Schimming praises J.D. Vance as VP pick\n\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming praised Trump’s vice presidential pick Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance as someone with a “compelling personal story” and said Vance’s Midwest ties could help Wisconsin Republicans.\n\n“As with most swing states, we’re looking for surrogates. We’re looking for people who can come in and identify with voters quickly,” Schimming said. “And he can do that.\"\n\n“That’s why it makes a difference,” Schimming added. “He can roll into a state like Wisconsin and immediately click. So anytime he wants to come to Wisconsin, I will put him in the car and personally drive him around.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s opposition to abortion, Schimming said Trump is the candidate “driving the issues and driving where people are.”\n\n“Donald Trump has not been laid back about saying, ‘Look, I’m not signing a national abortion ban,” Schimming said.\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nWarm weather cools off sales for Convention Fest\n\nWalking outside in near 90 degree weather isn't an ideal shopping environment, but that was the case for the first day of Convention Fest.\n\nMonday, dozens of vendors showed off their products or services to credentialed delegates, media and other officials.\n\nMadan Raj, founder and president of Bobbletopia, started his company in Omaha, Nebraska, four years ago and quickly moved to Milwaukee.\n\nRaj had several versions of Trump in presidential form, but also as William Wallace from the movie \"Braveheart,\" and the Trumpinator, inspired by the \"Terminator.\"\n\n“People have taken pictures of the Trump bobbleheads,” Raj said, adding he’s had a few sales but many people have opted to buy items later in the week, so they don’t have to carry it as long.\n\nRaj said he's been working with the Committee on Arrangements for the Republican National Committee to register for the event and drop off his inventory.\n\n“They have great staff behind the scenes who take care of all of that. They set up the tent, the tables were provided. All I had to really take care of was inventory, which I brought in,” Raj said. “We had to set up Thursday and Friday. Secret Service did their sweep on the weekend ... and today, just final setup.”\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nProtest zones draw few demonstrators\n\nZeidler Union Square, one of the city’s two designated protest zones, has been empty for most of Monday, except for a couple dozen security staff.\n\nThere’s been more dog-walkers than protesters, a security staffer said. A small group of about 15 people were in the park earlier in the day.\n\nHaymarket Square, another of the city’s two protest zones, had no protestors at 4 p.m. The platform has been quiet all day.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nVance gets official RNC nomination for vice president\n\nHours after former Trump announced U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance was his pick for vice president, the nomination became official at the RNC in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhen Vance entered the arena, he was greeted by cheers and chants of “J.D.” as well as “USA!”\n\nHis welcome seemed to be delayed by an apparent teleprompter malfunction that led to a jam band playing for at least 30 minutes.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\n50 Cent memes flood social media, RNC appearance rumored\n\nJournalists at CNN reported Monday afternoon on X that rap icon 50 Cent has spoken with Republican officials about making an appearance at the convention, according to people \"familiar\" with the situation.\n\nThe rapper and producer for hit television shows has been trending on social media lately following Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, survived a shooting in 2000. On the track “Many Men” from his 2003 album “Get Rich or Die Tryin,” 50 Cent raps about having enemies and people targeting him. The song has become a soundtrack for many on social media after the assassination attempt.\n\n50 Cent posted to X on Saturday his iconic album cover, edited with a picture of Trump instead.\n\n“Trump gets shot and now I’m trending,” he said.\n\nIn early June, 50 Cent and civil rights attorney Ben Crump appeared on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to advocate for more opportunities in the liquor industry. Speaking with CBS News at the time, 50 Cent said that he hadn't decided who he wanted to vote for in the upcoming election but could see Black men \"identifying with Trump.\"\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nRNC band steps up after apparent teleprompter malfunction\n\nA band was rocking out at Fiserv Forum after House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a teleprompter malfunction at the RNC.\n\nThe band played for about 30 minutes before the teleprompter started working properly again.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nRepublicans, equipment makers address manufacturing at RNC event\n\nMilwaukee-based Association of Equipment Manufacturers hosted a policy-focused event Monday with Republicans Gov. Glenn Youngkin, of Virgina; U.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin.\n\nA panel discussion addressed pro-growth economic policies, which Republicans say are necessary to bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.\n\nIt also highlighted the storied history that manufacturing and mining equipment manufacturer Komatsu have in Milwaukee.\n\nThe event was held at Komatsu’s mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee’s Harbor District.\n\nKomatsu builds some of the world’s largest mobile land machines. Its biggest mining shovel weighs nearly 4 million pounds and has a bucket the size of a two-car garage. In front of the company's mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee's Harbor District, there's a 60-foot-tall electric mining shovel and 850,000-pound truck on display.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse gets an RNC roll call shoutout\n\nWhen Brian Schimming, chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, welcomed convention-goers during the RNC roll call at Fiserv Forum on Monday afternoon, he gave a shoutout to the GOP’s Wisconsin roots.\n\n“One hundred and seventy years ago, this great party was founded down the road in Ripon, Wisconsin, in a little white schoolhouse,” Schimming said, flanked by former Gov. Scott Walker and others.\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse is yet more proof that there is indeed always a Wisconsin connection.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStreet vendor selling bloody Trump photo and pins for $5 each\n\nA T-shirt vendor is selling Trump merchandise, including a photo and pin of Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFor delegates and credentialed guests looking to get their hands on the golden Trump sneakers for $600, 365 Campaign is selling two pairs outside the Baird Center, sizes 6.5 and 7.5, for $600 each.\n\n“They’re very hard to come by,” manager Anthony Montgomery said. “They sell out quick.”\n\nMontgomery has a pair of his own.\n\n“I just wanted to see what it felt like to walk like President Trump,” Montgomery said. “This is the closest thing to it.”\n\nBefore coming to Milwaukee, Montgomery said the company was selling merchandise in Pennsylvania when Trump was nearly killed by an assassin.\n\n“It felt like a regular rally,” Montgomery said. “President Trump showed up, and I call it the seven-minute speech because that’s literally all he really had before they tried to take his life.”\n\nMontgomery said the shots sounded like fireworks but when he saw people running, that’s when he knew something serious happened.\n\n“I felt disrespected in a sense,” Montgomery said. “I felt like, 'How could they let something like this happen?'”Montgomery said he tried to keep his composure and help out people where they needed it.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nTensions rise between RNC protesters, anti-abortion group at Red Arrow Park\n\nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, an anti-abortion group, is demonstrating in Red Arrow Park, where protesters from the Coalition to March on the RNC are resting after their march.\n\nTensions are high between the anti-abortion group and those who disagree with them. But Coalition security guards formed a barrier around the group as they laid on the ground to demonstrate.\n\nThe group staged a “wedding” between the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party. A woman in white dress spattered with fake blood “married” a man wearing a pool noodle on his nose to represent an elephant trunk.\n\nA person was shouting through a bullhorn at close range to the group, and members of the group shouted back. One member activated a siren sound on his bullhorn.\n\nThis all occurred as speakers affiliated with the Coalition held their own rally feet away on the slab of concrete that in the winter serves as an ice rink.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBiden-Harris campaign criticizes Trump VP pick\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon criticized Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon.\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Dillon said in a statement.\n\nShe also condemned Vance’s stances on abortion, tax cuts and certification of the 2020 presidential election. Vance is staunchly against abortion but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe statement said the Biden-Harris ticket is “focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone and lowering costs” while the Trump-Vance ticket’s “harmful agenda will take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations.”\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler in a Monday statement said, “The stakes of this election just got impossibly higher” as a result of Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate.\n\n“Should Donald Trump win another term in the White House, there’s no question that J.D. Vance would put loyalty to Trump and the GOP’s extreme agenda over the country,” Wikler said. “In election after election, we’ve seen Wisconsinites reject the extreme, anti-freedom Trump-Vance agenda — and they’ll do it again this November.”\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTrump is officially nominated for president\n\nIt's official: Trump was officially nominated for president during the delegate roll call at the RNC Monday afternoon.\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, delivered the delegates that formally put the former president over the top, USA TODAY reported.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America,” he said.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump has his VP pick: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance\n\nA little over an hour before his vice presidential choice was set to be revealed, Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nVance will be \"strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond,\" Trump wrote.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC passes Fiserv Forum\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 passed the northern end of its march route a block from Fiserv Forum early Monday afternoon, crossing the Juneau Avenue bridge about 1:20 p.m.\n\nDespite its size, the group’s chants were largely inaudible to a reporter on the Deer District plaza, where music was playing and at least one interview was taking place over a loud speaker at one point.\n\nThe group stopped for a few minutes outside the entrance to the credentials-only “hard” security zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue. While they were there, their shouts mingled with music on the southeast end of the plaza.\n\nThe group had said its primary goal was to be within “sight and sound” of Fiserv Forum, and its route went right up against the fence that delineates the credentials-only “hard” zone from the security “footprint” where members of the public are able to enter.\n\nIts route took the group closer to Fiserv Forum than the city-designated demonstration area at Haymarket Square Park a bit farther north.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nParental rights, gender ideology take center stage in Heritage Foundation Policy Fest afternoon session\n\nHeritage Foundation researchers promoted traditional family values and bashed gender ideology during the afternoon panel of “Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future.”\n\nHeritage Foundation panelists Vice President of Domestic Policy Roger Severino, Senior Legal Fellow Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Research Associate for the Tech Policy Center Daniel Cochrane criticized the Biden administration's handling of Title IX and children's social media usage in a panel moderated by conservative personality Liz Wheeler in the Bradley Symphony Center.\n\n“We have to take back as parents our God-given right to parent our children, even when it's tough,” Perry said.\n\nBiden, in one of his first executive actions , expanded federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination in regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, including for transgender individuals.\n\nPerry said the first thing she’d like to see Trump do in office is revoke “all guidance” on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“From that first pebble, we see an avalanche of gender identity and orthodoxy in every system in America,” Perry said. “That is the primary responsibility, I think, of the next administration is to make sure that they don't sacrifice children on the altar of woke progressivism.”\n\nCochrane said gender ideology is spreading on platforms like Tik Tok. Panelists criticized youth access to inappropriate social media content and pornography. Cochran said sites like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube should enact age-verification requirements.\n\nPerry also said she wants Biden’s timeline on Title IX to remove expansions on gender ideology rescinded. She blamed teachers’ unions for “outsized influence” over educational policy agenda items like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ curriculum and hosting “drag queens for story hours.”\n\nLGBTQ+ experts say the Biden administration’s expansion of LGBTQ+ protections and gender affirming care has helped combat harassment and discrimination. His policies have earned him the endorsement of LGBTQ+ advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nCombating deep fakes in politics requires quick action but not over-reacting\n\nThe challenges posed by deep fakes in election campaigns are global, but on Monday, Microsoft Corp. addressed them as part of the RNC.\n\nDeep fakes are images, videos or audio recordings convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say. One example in the presidential campaign was a fake voice message claiming to be President Joe Biden urging New Hampshire voters not to take part in the primary election.\n\nMonday at noon, as part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft offered free training in identifying and addressing deep fakes, especially in political campaigns.\n\n“We’re very concerned about what the next few months look like leading into the U.S. election,” Ginny Badanes, general manager of Democracy Forward said in a Journal Sentinel interview.\n\n“I would say anywhere a political leader is talking publicly and being recorded, there’s a risk of that recording being manipulated to make it look like they said something at that event they didn’t say,” she added.\n\nA poorly made deep fake may be easy to identify. Voices that sound robotic, or unnatural speech patterns, are signs. Strange eye movements and a lack of blinking are other indicators. But detection is more difficult in a professionally made deep fake, and some of the most convincing are in local elections, according to Microsoft.\n\nA quick response, pointing people to the correct information, is important when a political campaign has been attacked with a deep fake or other type of false narrative.\n\nHere are some tips from Microsoft:\n\nInitiate an immediate response, based on factual data, that dismantles the falsehoods without amplifying them.\n\nTo start, evaluate the content’s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike AI-generated parodies of their candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech.\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. But if the content crosses ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nBy promptly addressing false claims, you establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent misinformation.\n\nIf it’s a deep-fake video of a candidate, typically there’s a genuine video on which the fake was based. “That is one of the best antidotes, to get that out publicly, and say it’s the real video,” Badanes said.\n\nWhen deep fakes come with a high probability of losing votes, options include calling a press conference, issuing a public statement, or asking for a retraction.

Storms are expected to be stronger along Wisconsin's border with Illinois.\n\nThe outdoor Convention Fest is scheduled to end at 5:30 p.m., and the evening official session inside Fiserv Forum runs from 5:45 p.m. until 10 p.m. That means delegates and media are likely to be indoors when severe weather comes through.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRNC uses influencers to reach young voters\n\nThe RNC is using a new method to reach youth voters this week — more than 70 influencers. Youth Advisory Council Co-Chairs Brilyn Hollyhand, 18, and CJ Pearson, 21, lead the effort.\n\n“Young people don't trust billboards, they don't trust pamphlets, they don't trust direct mail, they don’t trust TV ads. They trust people,” Pearson said. “If we can mobilize influencers to fight for America, to come to our side, we can mobilize legions of young people as well.”\n\nAmong them are former Miss Universe judge and social media personality Emily Austin, Mikel Simmons of Bravo’s “Southern Hospitality” and Xaviaer DuRousseau, a creator with conservative organization PragerU.\n\nDuRousseau said influencers help bridge the trust gap between candidates and voters.\n\n“We are able to make the information palatable,” DuRousseau said. “We've gone through all the fluff, we've seen the details. Now, here is a summarized version from me, an influencer, someone that you trust.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention Committee last month announced similar plans to five influencers access credentials in Chicago.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nAnti-abortion protesters rally in Haymarket Square\n\nAbout 50 anti-abortion protesters rallied at Haymarket Square Park around noon.\n\nAmong them was Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director. He said the initial goal was to encourage the Republican Party to strengthen their stance on abortion.\n\nBut after the RNC platform committee announced a softened stance on abortion, Sande turned from “frustrated” to “angry.”\n\n“The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,” he said.\n\nHe said some who find the GOP abortion stance objectionable may stay home from the polls. Others will vote but will avoid enthusiastically door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts, he said.\n\nHe said even if Trump were elected, it would be difficult to pass the kind of anti-abortion legislation he wants — such as a ban at conception or “fetal personhood” protections.\n\nFetal personhood would grant embryos and fetuses legal and constitutional protections that are equivalent to the person who's carrying them at every stage of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts have said any recognition of fetal personhood could have ripple effects far beyond a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions, potentially outlawing in vitro fertilization, embryonic stem cell research and some forms of birth control.\n\n“This is really taking the air out of the tires,” Sande said. “Literally and emotionally, it’s deflating to the base.”\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nCheese curd vendor at Convention Fest brought over 360 pounds of cheese\n\nThere's one vendor at Convention Fest that will undoubtedly be popular: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds, owned and operated by David and Sanita Hofer. They've been in business for 16 years, working about 60 fairs and festivals in the Milwaukee area each season.\n\n\"This is not our first rodeo,\" David Hofer said about introducing out-of-state visitors to cheese curds. He has a sign set up next to the tent that explains the process of making cheese curds.\n\nHofer likes fried and raw cheese curds equally, but \"every time I think I'm getting sick of eating fried curds, I find myself still eating fried curds.\"\n\nHofer first learned about Convention Fest by reading about it in the paper. They went to a trade show, and convention organizers asked them a few months ago if they'd be interested in being a vendor.\n\nHofer, who was working the booth Monday afternoon with his two daughters, was getting customers even before Convention Fest officially started at 2 p.m. And they expected to keep selling even after the event wraps up at 5:30 p.m.\n\nHe found a calculator and estimated he brought 360 pounds of cheese for the curds to Convention Fest, plus 60 pounds of sliced cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches. Those cheeses come from Ellsworth and Plymouth, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I'm just hoping that we can represent the great state of Wisconsin with high-quality food,\" Hofer said.\n\nThere were plenty more Wisconsin vendors outside, including a beef stick stand. Drink Wisconsinbly also had tents and displayed not-so-political signs, such as \"I support fish frys,\" \"Pro-beers & bratwursts\" and \"Vote yes: Brandy old fashioneds.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee City Attorney Evan Goyke observes march\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke and former deputy city attorney Adam Stephens, who's working for the city this week as special counsel, observe the march from the front.\n\nGoyke declined to answer questions. He previously told the Journal Sentinel that he and Stephens would be observing protest activity around the RNC throughout the week.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been a large law enforcement presence around the march. A unit of officers on bicycles were seen staying a couple blocks away from the demonstration.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman has said he wants the department to be largely \"invisible\" when it comes to policing mass demonstrations during the RNC.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC begins, route to go through downtown Milwaukee\n\nHundreds of people started marching at noon Monday.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC has a planned route of heading south on Water Street, across the Milwaukee River on Wells Street, before marching south on Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe group will then cross the river again and march north on Water Street to West Juneau Avenue, then south on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive before crossing the river again at West State Street.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nEvent staff near Haymarket Square are trained in de-escalation\n\nThe first two groups scheduled to speak at the Haymarket Square Park protest zone were no-shows.\n\nThat's according to Ashanti Hamilton, director of the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety (formerly the Office of Violence Prevention). He was at the zone to coordinate the speaker's platform and a group of event security staff in orange shirts.\n\nMost of the staff were community organizers trained in de-escalation and mediation tactics, Hamilton said.\n\n\"These are the most experienced folks that we have in crowd control,\" he said.\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 15 speakers were scheduled to take to the platform, he said. Because the park was nearly empty, at least one group of protesters stopped by, then promptly left, Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the Trump assassination attempt changed the potential protest landscape.\n\n\"I'm just hoping, now that we have heightened tensions, that those things don't boil over into any of the demonstration activities,\" he said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBay View restaurant to donate portion of sales to progressive organizations this week\n\nBay View restaurant Heirloom MKE, 2378 S.

About a handful of security staff wearing bright orange T-shirts are scattered throughout the area.\n\nAt around 11:40 a.m., three people at the square's pavilion briefly read testimonies from both local and national victims of gun violence, attracting one spectator.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nRipon's Little White Schoolhouse replica at RNC built by high schoolers\n\nA replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, is on display at the RNC's Convention Fest outside the Baird Center and Panther Arena.\n\nA one-third scale replica of the schoolhouse, constructed by Ripon High School students for parades and city events, will be on display at the RNC.\n\nThe full-size schoolhouse was Ripon's first public school, built in 1853, and is now more popularly known as the Little White School House, the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\"We are so excited to have a way to showcase the incredible history that took place here in Ripon 170 years ago,\" Ripon Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mandy Kimes told the Fond du Lac Reporter. \"This is Ripon’s unique history and contribution to the development of our nation.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee firefighter staffing double for RNC, union president says\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department is staffing about double its normal number of workers for the RNC.\n\nEric Daun, the president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said that, on an average day, there are about 200 firefighters staffed around the city, but there’s “well over 200” additional staff for the convention.\n\n“I would say the members are being taxed to the max of their capacity,” Daun said. “We’re doing it to the best of their ability. I’ll say that.”\n\nHe said the department is getting help from suburban Milwaukee County departments. However, unlike with the police, there’s no out-of-state help.\n\n“Stress is at a higher level, but it is what it is. It’s to be expected,” Daun said.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said the department had responded to a handful of minor incidents Monday morning. Overall, he said the day was going well.\n\n\"We got a lot of the kinks out on Sunday,\" he said. \"We're feeling OK with things out here.\"\n\n— David Clarey\n\nAbout 500 people gather for Coalition the March on the RNC rally at Red Arrow Park before march\n\nWith a rally underway ahead of the noon march by the Coalition the March on the RNC, a crowd of about 500 has gathered at Red Arrow, so far smaller than what organizers said they anticipated, about 5,000.\n\nAttendees have come from across the country to bring attention to a range of issues.\n\nCharlie Berg came from Minneapolis with the Climate Justice Committee. He said the Democratic and Republican parties have both failed to address climate change.\n\n“We need a platform and policy that is actually going to address climate change and we can’t do that so long as we have U.S. militarism, so long as we have reliance on fossil fuels, and so long as those corrupt parties are in power,” Berg said.\n\nBadger Van Grey, who is hosting a sign-making station, said the most common signs have included a focus on immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, “We can no longer afford the rich” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nA handful of counter-protesters are at Red Arrow, deriding LBGTQ+ people and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA speaker with the group said he was from Indiana and identified himself only as Jim with Street Preachers. The man protested outside the 2016 RNC in Cleveland and has appeared on college campuses for many years.\n\nSome march attendees stood around the small group to film them but there were few interactions.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\nJournal Sentinel's JR Radcliffe, Kristin Brey preview RNC in Milwaukee\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC protesters speak about Gaza, abortion rights\n\nAs hundreds gathered in Red Arrow Park Monday, Kobi Guillory, a Chicago teacher and central committee member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization, kicked off the press conference with a focus on Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Our government, in a bipartisan initiative, is committing genocide in Palestine with our tax dollars and reinforcing daily militarism,” Guillory said.\n\nAhead of the march, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said he expected the top issues for marchers would be abortion rights and standing with Palestinian people.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has retaliated with an intense military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including women and children, medical authorities in Gaza have said.\n\nSeveral people told the Journal Sentinel they had come from Atlanta and Minnesota with Gaza top of mind.\n\nVictoria Hinckley, who said she was expelled from the University of South Florida for her involvement in a Palestinian-solidarity encampment there, attended the march with others from Students for a Democratic Society. Hinckley’s remarks Monday focused on abortion.\n\n“These attacks on reproductive freedom and abortion access are harshly felt in the South, especially in states like Florida and Texas with the emergence of anti-abortion bills banning abortion within the first few weeks of pregnancy,” she said.\n\n— Rory Linnane and Ashley Luthern\n\nMilwaukee 70-something couple comes to march against RNC\n\nBill Nantell and girlfriend Kathleen Joynt, both in their mid-70s who live near downtown Milwaukee, said they came to Red Arrow Park Monday to march against Republican policies on abortion, racism and senior benefits.\n\n\"I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans,\" Nantell said. \"This is not a Republican Party I am familiar with at all.\"\n\nNantell said he would like President Joe Biden to step aside for a younger candidate. But he will vote for him if Biden stays in.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nStreet evangelists among the few at Haymarket Square Park\n\nA handful of street evangelists stood in a strip of shade on Haymarket Square Park, at North King Drive and West McKinley Avenue, holding signs with Bible verses.\n\nOne man with a microphone was preaching to a near-empty park.\n\nWarren Marquardt of Polk City, Florida, affiliated with Calvary Chapel, said he attends four or five public events a year to spread his message. He recognized the other preachers as regulars at big events.\n\n“There’s no politician that’s going to come on the scene and make it all right,” he said.\n\nStirling Long of Dawsonville, Georgia, affiliated with Providence Bible Church, a Reformed Baptist church, held a sign that read, “Are you going to Heaven? Free test.”\n\nAsked about the Republican Party’s softer abortion stance in its RNC platform, Long said he would not “vote for baby killers.”\n\n“They’re doing it for votes,” he said. “This is a game.”\n\nMarquardt also distanced himself from the GOP stance on abortion, saying, “God will do what God wants to do,” no matter the president in office.\n\nElsewhere along the security perimeter, streets were quiet. Event security staff in orange T-shirts milled around chatting. Police boats trawled the river.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\n'Reagan' movie posters showing up around RNC security perimeter\n\nPosters for an upcoming movie on President Ronald Reagan have popped up around the security perimeter in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Reagan\" stars Dennis Quaid and is scheduled to be released Aug. 30.\n\nThe RNC is also screening \"Reagan\" all day every day in the Regency Ballroom at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center for convention-goers.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nConvention Fest sets up outside Panther Arena\n\nMid-Monday morning, white vendor tents were going up between the Baird Center and Panther Arena for Convention Fest, where those with credentials can experience local food and products.\n\nAmong the 100 local businesses participating in Convention Fest are Immy's African Cuisine and Scrima's Pizza. A Wisconsin cheese curds tent was in a prime location.\n\nIn the center of the road stood a replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, considered to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump expected to announce his VP pick Monday afternoon\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier says Trump confirmed to him he’ll announce his running mate Monday.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nTop names for the spot include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But it’s not out of the question that Trump will make a more surprising pick.\n\nTrump had previously hinted he would announce his VP at the RNC, though that announcement typically came a few days before the convention in campaigns.\n\n— Hope Karnopp and USA TODAY's David Jackson\n\nArtists stage live climate change installation next to RNC security perimeter\n\nA team of actors and artists from Climate Power, a strategic communications organization that seeks to educate Americans on climate change, debuted a public art installation in the windows of the Germania Building, 135 W. Wells St., Monday morning. It’s located just outside the RNC's hard security perimeter.\n\nThe exhibit features five street-facing window displays depicting life-sized scenes of people affected by extreme weather situations, including excessive heat and flooding. Actors will bring to life the experiences of real extreme weather survivors who Climate Power and its partner artists have interviewed.\n\nNew York-based artist Annie Saunders said the installation is inspired by museum dioramas.\n\n“The aesthetic of a diorama is recognizable; it’s usually for history, it’s for prehistory, it’s for things that were frozen in time and are not happening anymore ...,” she said. “So, using that aesthetic to represent something that is happening but is being willfully ignored is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe first window of the exhibit depicts a child’s playroom affected by extreme heat. A small plastic chair is melting, crayon wax is pooling on the table, construction paper pinned to the wall is fading, and the wallpaper is curling at the edges. An actor tries frantically to start an air conditioner.\n\nAnother window shows men in suits sitting around an office table for a business meeting with their heads literally stuck in a pile of sand in the middle of the table. File cabinets in the hallway leading to the meeting room are strewn about and black tar leaks out of them.\n\nSaunders said this represents politicians and officials who “have their heads in the sand” when it comes to the effects of climate change and choose to accept donations from oil and gas companies.\n\n“The problem with climate change is it’s so conceptual, and the language is so saturated ...,” Saunders said. “It’s being communicated with words, which are fundamentally abstract objects, and you have to hear the word and then have a visual or an emotional response.”\n\nDue to the installation’s proximity to the RNC, Saunders said Climate Power hopes to send a message to elected officials and people in power. She hopes the images stick with officials and help them realize that they too could be the victims of extreme weather.\n\n“Extreme heat and these issues do not discriminate on the basis of wealth and power,” Saunders said. “It’s coming for everyone.”\n\nSaunders and the Climate Power team have been working on the installation for over two months and have been setting it up on the Germania Building’s first floor for five days. Passersby will be able to see it through the windows all day Monday and until about noon Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHundreds already gathering at Red Arrow Park for march on RNC\n\nOrganizers with the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 are setting up Monday morning at Red Arrow Park, where they plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. and rally at 11 a.m. before marching in protest outside the RNC.\n\nSeveral hundred people already had gathered at the park by 10 a.m. and the event is expected to draw more than 5,000 people.\n\nOrganizers plan to march within a block of the convention’s main site, Fiserv Forum. They have remained committed to the plan despite heightened anxiety about security in the city after the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nThe coalition plans to avoid the credentials-only “hard” security zone around the RNC but plans to enter the “soft” security zone. While the city has a sanctioned march route in the soft zone, the group plans to take its own route to get closer to Fiserv.\n\nOn Friday, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said the group had a \"handshake agreement\" with city officials that the group would be allowed to use its own route. City officials didn’t confirm such an agreement but confirmed they were working with the group to ensure marchers could safely exercise their rights.\n\nThe “soft” security zone has special rules under the city’s extraordinary event ordinance, including a ban on certain items like non-plastic water bottles, umbrellas with a metal tip, bike locks, and bags larger than 18-by-13-by-7 inches.\n\nThe Coalition consists of local and national organizations, including the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Anti-War Committee.\n\nWhile the groups' individual missions vary, the Coalition's shared priorities include fighting for reproductive rights, standing with Palestinians and defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ people. Many organizers are also unsatisfied with the Democratic Party and plan to protest the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nMajor Goolsby's teams with Broken Bat Brewing to release Screamin' Eagle Lager\n\nIf there's a official beer of the RNC, it might be at Major Goolsby's.\n\nThe well-known sports bar, just on the outside of the convention hard security zone, partnered with Broken Bat Brewing Company to release Screamin' Eagle Lager.\n\nThe restaurant describes the beer as \"crisp, refreshing.\" It's available in 16-ounce cans \"until we sell out!\"\n\n\"A beautiful spin on our traditional Eagle, all artwork was down by our very own Orissa Camille,\" the restaurant wrote on Facebook. \"Get them while they last!\"\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nLong lines form at security checkpoint outside RNC\n\nA long line of cars and other vehicles had formed by 8 a.m. along North Water Street, leading up to a security checkpoint on West Michigan Street near North Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe cars were waiting to go through one of the five security checkpoints along the edge of the security zone surrounding the RNC.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel were instructing drivers at the checkpoint on West Michigan Street to open the hoods of their vehicles, roll down all windows and remain in their vehicles. Once at the checkpoint, law enforcement opened each vehicle’s trunk to check inside and walked a canine around the vehicle.\n\nFrom near the front of the line at 7:45 a.m., Olivia Rivers of Racine said she had been waiting in line about an hour and a half. She works at the 3rd Street Market Hall and had gotten in line about 6:20 a.m. She was supposed to start work at 7.\n\n“The Market Hall told us we’d need an extra hour of travel time,” she said. “I didn’t figure it would take this long.”\n\nBritney Carter of Milwaukee also works inside the security zone and was late to work Monday morning because of the delays.\n\n“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said.\n\nShe works at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and waited in line for about 40 minutes.\n\nAvery Leo, who lives in the security zone, also didn’t expect the long wait and said he would consider taking a different route to get home.\n\n“It’s annoying,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nDowntown RNC 'soft' security zone quiet\n\nThe downtown “soft” security zone/footprint where pedestrians can freely cross inside, was quiet Monday morning.\n\nPedestrians with various levels of credentials — or not — walked through and police at the fences denoting the credentials-only “hard” zone seemed relaxed. A few vehicles moved through the area.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMicrosoft has 'deep fakes' training at noon and 5 p.m.\n\nAs part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft Corp. is offering free training in Milwaukee on Monday aimed at helping political campaigns, activists and party officials identify and address deep fakes, which are images or videos convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say.\n\nThe sessions, focused on women, democracy and elections, are at noon and 5 p.m. at Northern Lights, an event venue at 106 W. Seeboth St. Speakers will include Ginny Badanes, general manager of the Democracy Forward campaign; and Republican U.S. Reps. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma; Burgess Owens of Utah; and Kat Cammack of Florida.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRon Johnson chart credited as difference-maker in Trump assassination attempt\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson may have played a serendipitous role in Trump surviving the Saturday assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat’s because Trump, as he detailed in an interview with the New York Post, turned his head slightly the moment before shots were fired to read a chart on illegal immigration. The source of that chart? Johnson, who spoke about it on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier.\n\nIn an interview with Baier, the senator said he initially showed a chart on illegal immigration to Trump on a plane ride to a rally in Green Bay. The senator said that Trump liked the chart, and his team took it, tweaked it and used it at the Saturday rally.\n\nA bullet pierced Trump's right ear, but he wasn't seriously injured.\n\n“I’m happy to have been of service there,” Johnson said on the Fox News program.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nPolice make two arrests Sunday near RNC security zone, welcome party\n\nPolice made two arrests near the Republican National Convention grounds and its events Sunday.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said both incidents involved drunk people. One person was arrested near the Summerfest grounds, near where a convention welcome party was being held, and another was arrested after driving into a security barrier near the convention.\n\n“The events overnight were described to me as really uneventful,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “There’s been a lot of preparation that’s gone on into the planning of this political convention and the bulk of that planning has been directly involved in and around the area of public safety.”\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: It'll be a hot, humid day, with a chance of storms Monday night\n\nThe weather forecast looks hot for the convention's first day.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 89 degrees around 5 p.m., with a heat index of 95, according to the National Weather Service. Heat indices in the 90s are expected between 1 and 8 p.m. High humidity is also in the forecast throughout the day, causing things to feel \"uncomfortable,\" said Milwaukee-Sullivan NWS meteorologist Marcia Cronce.\n\nThe heat and humidity should feel similar to Sunday, when Milwaukee County was under a heat advisory. However, a heat advisory isn't expected to be issued Monday because heat indices will be just below 100 degrees instead of at or over 100, Cronce explained. Still, the Weather Service urges people to stay hydrated, limit time outside and take other precautions to prevent heat-related illness.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are possible between 7 p.m. and midnight, with chances peaking at 62% around 9 p.m. Some storms could be severe, Cronce said, with damaging winds being the main threat.\n\nHeavy rain, hail and even tornadoes are possible, Cronce added. The risk for severe storms is more likely near the Illinois border. Brief, heavy downpours are likely but shouldn't stay over single areas for extended periods.\n\nThe hot weather should subside by Tuesday after a cold front moves in overnight, Cronce said.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Monday\n\nThe first official session of the convention starts at 12:35 p.m. and runs until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m.\n\nHowever, the day is littered with events before and after the official sessions.\n\nThe events kick off at 8 a.m., with The Heritage Foundation’s policy-centric event called the Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future and state delegation breakfasts throughout the early morning. Other events include things like a screening of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events.\n\nThe City Channel will broadcast the Republican National Convention beginning at 6 p.m. Monday. It'll air 24/7 and end at midnight Friday. Viewers can watch via Spectrum Cable on Channel 25 as well as on the “Livestream 1” feed.\n\nOther coverage will be available through Spectrum News and Fox News Media.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; group receptions; groups like Moms for Liberty, the American Jewish Committee and the European Union will host events; and there will be more movie screenings, too.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson strikes tone of unity\n\nIn a briefing outside City Hall early Monday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he would avoid focusing on political differences in light of the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nJohnson, a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, instead struck a tone of unity.\n\n“While Democrats and Republicans differ substantially on how we get there, the fact of the matter is … that we all want people of this country to succeed,” he said. “We want families in Milwaukee to have the opportunity to thrive. We want financial stability. We want peace, we want growth, we want health for citizens here, across our state and across our country.”\n\nJohnson also said he thought Biden was “showcasing leadership” in the wake of the attack on Trump by pausing political ads and events.\n\nHe also acknowledged the presidential election rematch between Trump and Biden in November.\n\n“Although the president may not be engaging in political activity in this specific moment in light of what’s happened, I’ve got no doubt that those things will continue,” Johnson said. “Obviously, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago next month and the president will have the opportunity to showcase the difference between his policies, what he’s done, what he intends to do for the United States and its people in the future.”\n\nHe said he was looking forward to serving as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention and working to ensure Biden wins a second term in November.\n\nJohnson said he felt “great” about having the RNC in the city, saying he wanted the event to serve as a stepping stone toward further growth.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nRNC security plan 'strengthened,' Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service has \"strengthened\" its security plan in the wake of Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement Monday morning.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Cheatle’s statement said.\n\n“In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump's detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nThe statement comes a day after the Secret Service’s RNC coordinator, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, said the agency was “not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans.”\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Cheatle said the security plans for events like the RNC are “designed to be flexible.”“As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee,” she said.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny after a gunman was able to shoot and injure Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania from a nearby rooftop. One man, Corey Comperatore, was killed and two people were injured, and Secret Service snipers killed the gunman, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick. Asked whether a running mate would join Trump on stage Monday, Bossie said: \"I don't get ahead of him, but that's — the plan is, it's imminent, for certain.\"\n\nTrump’s motorcade arrived Sunday night at the Pfister Hotel, where many expect he'll be staying.\n\nSecret Service agents lined the perimeter and eyed the surrounding rooftops as dozens of SUVs pulled up to the storied hotel.\n\nTrump, however, could not be spotted exiting his vehicle. A tent was waiting outside the entrance, and security quickly pulled the curtains shut.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC 2024 will continue as planned Monday\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route Monday.\n\nOn Friday, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with the Milwaukee Police Department and the city attorney’s office, though city officials didn't confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed the route with the city Saturday night.\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. Monday, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at noon. The group currently only plans to march Monday.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R. Phillips Avenue closed between West Michigan Street and West McKinley Avenue (the parking garage entrance on North Vel R. Phillips Avenue immediately south of West Michigan Street will be accessible to vehicles)\n\nNorth 6th Street closed between West Michigan Street and West McKinley Avenue (the 5th Street Parking Garage will be accessible to residents of the 550 Ultra Lofts Building and guests of the Trade Hotel via 6th Street)\n\nNorth James Lovell Street closed between West Wells Street and West Juneau Avenue\n\nSouthbound I-43 ramp closed from Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nEastbound I-794 ramp closed from North James Lovell Street\n\nAlso, the westbound I-794 ramp to the northbound I-43 ramp will have intermittent closures as needed for bus traffic.\n\nWidespread street parking restrictions will also be in effect until Sunday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHow will the RNC affect public transportation?\n\nMultiple Milwaukee County Transit System bus routes will be disrupted or follow detours until Friday, including the East-West Bus Rapid Transit CONNECT 1. There will also be disruptions to the County's paratransit service, Transit Plus, for riders with disabilities.\n\nBublr Bikes, Milwaukee's bikeshare system, will shut down seven of its stations until Friday. The stations are all located downtown in and around the security perimeter.\n\nMilwaukee's Hop streetcar will run on a normal schedule from 5 a.m. to midnight and arrive every 15 minutes.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhen does the RNC start? When is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe RNC begins Monday, July 15.\n\nHow long does the RNC last? What are the RNC convention dates?\n\nThe convention runs four days, from Monday, July 15 through Thursday, July 18.\n\nHow to watch the RNC convention\n\nThe convention venues are closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers. However, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. FOX News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\nWhat's the RNC 2024 convention schedule?\n\nHere's the master schedule of events for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe convention is closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; affinity group receptions; lectures and presentations; and film screenings.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; be sure to consult the master calendar for information on how to register.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat's the RNC convention location?\n\nFiserv Forum, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, is the main venue for the RNC. That's also where the first Republican debate was held in August. Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC. Those attendees already have credentials to get inside the convention venues.\n\nIn other words, you can't buy a ticket to get into the convention if you're a member of the public.\n\nBut there are other RNC-related events that are open to the public. And, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. Fox News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, in 2024?\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago — less than 100 miles south of the RNC — from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/26/vitro-cheetahs-devils-tower-smart-marina-news-around-states/111370700/", "title": "In vitro cheetahs, Devils Tower: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGulf Shores: The state’s conservation agency says it’s raising flounder for the first time to supplement a decline in the natural population of the flat fish in coastal waters. Workers with the Marine Resources Division are tending to thousands of larval flounder at a state hatchery in Gulf Shores, according to a news release from the agency. They hope to get between 1,000 and 5,000 fish from the hatchery in the first year, with a goal of releasing about 60,000 fish annually in a few years. Those fish would help add to a population of southern flounder that’s been falling since 2008. Scientists aren’t sure what is causing the decline. The state decreased bag limits for the fish this year and closed the season for the whole month of November to protect the flounder that were migrating through coastal bays on their way to winter spawning grounds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The oldest son of President Donald Trump has received a permit to hunt and kill a grizzly bear in the state, officials said Monday. Donald Trump Jr. was granted the permit to hunt north and east of Nome later this year, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. The governor has a limited number of “dignitary” licenses and game tags that he can hand out, Fish and Game spokesman Rick Green said. Trump Jr. did not receive one. He instead applied for one of 27 licenses designated for out-of-state hunters in the area. Only two other hunters applied. Officials said permits near Nome likely are not in demand for a variety of reasons, including the remoteness of the area and the expense to get there. As an out-of-state resident, Trump Jr. must be accompanied by a licensed Alaska guide for his hunt.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Republicans in the state Senate have given initial approval to a measure that would ask voters to limit the population differences among Arizona’s 30 legislative districts, over opposition from Democrats. The measure by Sen. J.D. Mesnard would require the state’s redistricting commission to create districts with a maximum difference of 5,000 people. Currently, a 10% difference is considered constitutional, meaning districts can vary by about 20,000 people. Democrats argued the change would greatly affect the ability of tribes and minority communities to elect representatives of their choice. They also said putting in hard rules like Mesnard proposes minimizes other factors the state’s Independent Redistricting Commission is required to consider, including keeping communities of interest together if possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nEureka Springs: A cemetery will continue allowing individuals or groups to place Confederate flags on grave markers unless a family member of the deceased objects, despite complaints the flag is a racist symbol. Eureka Springs’ cemetery commission approved an amendment earlier this month also requiring anyone wanting to place flags or plaques to get permission from the cemetery superintendent, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Glenna Booth, a member of the commission, said the amendment was her idea. “I just tried to come up with something that would be fair to everyone,” Booth said. Gloria Stevens, sexton at the cemetery, said there are about 47 Confederate veterans and 97 Union veterans among the 4,600 burials there. She said the cemetery was established in 1889, so none of those veterans died during the Civil War.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In their latest bid to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis, lawmakers on Monday announced a package of bills to limit development fees that can add tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a new home. However, local governments depend heavily on the fees, which typically are used to pay for schools, roads and parks. Lawmakers said they were discussing those needs but have not yet decided how the fees might be replaced. The fees are “vital to local government’s ability to pay for the infrastructure that residents living in new developments need,” Chris Lee, legislative representative for the California State Association of Counties, said in a statement. Development-related fees, also known as impact fees, can provide up to a third of some cities’ budgets, according to a report last year by the University of California, Berkeley, Terner Center for Housing Innovation.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Thousands of 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential primary for the first time under a new state law. The law allows 17-year-olds to cast ballots in spring primaries if they turn 18 before November’s general election. At least seven states and Washington, D.C., have similar laws. According to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office, about 24,000 teens are eligible to vote in the March 3 primary under the change, a small number in a state with 3.4 million voters, the Sentinel Colorado reports. Three Overland High School students who were interviewed about the new law said they did not know about their ability to vote until a few weeks ago and figure most of their peers were not aware either.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state legislative committee voted Monday to advance a bill that would eliminate the state’s religious exemption for certain childhood vaccines, despite vocal opposition from hundreds of parents and children who packed the Connecticut Capitol complex in hopes of persuading lawmakers to defeat it. The legislation narrowly cleared the General Assembly’s Public Health Committee by a vote of 14-11, prompting chants of “we will remember in November” after the tally was announced. Some opponents of the bill booed and shouted at the legislators who had voted for the measure as they left the hearing room and tried to get into elevators to their offices. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the bill, which now awaits further action in the House of Representatives. It’s considered one of the most contentious issues of the three-month legislative session, fueling concerns about the safety of vaccines and the curtailment of parental and religious rights.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has rejected a challenge by state environmental officials to rules issued by utility regulators regarding renewable energy requirements. The judge on Monday ruled that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has no standing to challenge regulations issued by the Public Service Commission. Superior Court Judge Ferris Wharton agreed with the commission and the state Division of the Public Advocate that DNREC had no standing to sue because it was neither a “person” nor “aggrieved” under Delaware’s Administrative Procedures Act. Environmental secretary Shawn Garvin did not respond to an email seeking comment, but a spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision and will discuss its options. The ruling is the latest development in a long-running legal dispute over which state agency has authority to develop regulations regarding how minimum renewable energy purchase requirements can be frozen if they become too costly for ratepayers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man who was injured while assembling a construction crane was safely rescued from a high angle in D.C. The man, who wasn’t identified, suffered a serious injury to his leg Saturday while working on the crane about 230 feet off the ground, news outlets report. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services used a second crane to reach the man and provide initial treatment. He was then placed in a basket and lowered to the ground, according to videos shared by the department. The worker was taken to the hospital for an injury not considered life-threatening.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Promising to be a worldwide first, a new Southwest Florida marina could set the standard for future boat storage. Set to open in April on Fort Myers Beach, Gulf Star Marina is being branded as the “world’s first SMART Marina” due to using its ASAR, or automated, storage and retrieval system. “The entire world is watching,” said Todd Carroll, one of the marina’s owners and president of Carroll Properties. “We believe it has the ability to change the way we store boats. It’s just a much better way.” The technology was developed by Austria-based LTW Intralogistics, which has been creating automated systems for warehouses used by companies like IKEA for decades, Carroll said. But it’s never been done in a marina before, according to Carroll. The railed system ditches the diesel-powered forklift often used in dry storage facilities and replaces it with an automated, electric-powered storage crane and shuttles.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State senators have approved a measure that would increase the fee for dumping coal ash in Georgia. The Senate passed Senate Bill 123 on Monday by a vote of 52-2, sending it to the House for more work. The measure would raise the fee for dumping coal ash from $1 a ton to $2.50 a ton, equaling what it costs to dispose of other kinds of garbage at Georgia landfills. Lawmakers raised the fee for other garbage in 2018 but left the fee for coal ash at $1. Coal ash has become a flashpoint in the current General Assembly session and in the state at large. A 2018 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice found contaminated groundwater near 11 of 12 coal-fired power plants. The refuse contains heavy metals and other contaminates that can leach into groundwater. Near Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer in Juliette, environmentalists have been conducting tests that have found residents have contaminated well water.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A research report has predicted the state may be hit by the economic fallout of a new virus, negatively affecting the tourism industry. The University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization said the spread of COVID-19 could undermine previous predictions that 2020 would be a better year for tourism than 2019. The organization’s latest quarterly forecast on the state’s visitor industry released Monday said the virus that started in China has changed its previous calculation. “I think if it hadn’t been for this virus outbreak, it probably would have been better – mostly because the global economy was sort of repairing itself,” said Carl Bonham, the organization’s executive director. “Trade tensions had eased up a little bit. We were expecting some recovery in 2020, and now that hope has sort of been dashed.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Visitors to the state who are 18 and older and can legally possess firearms would be allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits under legislation that headed to the House on Monday. The House State Affairs Committee voted 11-3 to approve the bill brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. Republicans on the committee backed the measure, while all the Democrats voted against it. Idaho residents 18 and older are allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits in Idaho without a permit or training following a new law that went into place last summer. The legislation would extend that to any legal resident of the United States or a U.S. armed services member. Zito said the legislation is intended to clear up confusion. Opponents say allowing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon without any required training within city limits is a bad idea and could lead to shootings.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The sale of recreational marijuana in the state generated $7.3 million in cannabis tax revenue last month, the Department of Revenue announced Monday. The department also reported that an additional $3.1 million was generated in retail sales tax revenue. Dispensaries across the state sold nearly $40 million in recreational pot last month. Toi Hutchinson, an adviser to Gov. J.B. Pritzker on cannabis control, said the goal of Illinois’ legal cannabis industry is to build a socially equitable program to help communities most harmed by the nation’s war on drugs. “Revenue raised in this first month will soon begin flowing back into those communities to begin repairing the damage done by the failed policies of the past and creating new opportunities for those who have been left behind for far too long,” Hutchinson said.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at Grissom Air Reserve Base is seeking a $100,000 boost from local government toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders are asking for Miami County economic development fund money as they plan the estimated $700,000 exhibit space featuring the bomber, dozens of which were stationed at the Indiana base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber, and only seven remain out of the 116 built, the Kokomo Tribune reports. The museum has raised more than $100,000 toward the project and hopes to build a roof over the Hustler this year while continuing to raise money, museum Director Tom Jennings said. The project plans call for a display of artifacts about the bomber’s history and a loft area allowing visitors to look down on the plane. The Miami County Council could vote on the funding request next month.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is considering asking businesses seeking city tax incentives to also provide housing options if they employ low-income workers. It’s just one proposal for how the city could use its policies, zoning ordinances and financial incentives to ensure its mix of housing includes options that are affordable for its workforce. A workforce housing study released in May found central Iowa is short 57,179 new housing units for the region’s anticipated job growth in the next 20 years. Nearly half of those new workers would need housing priced below $175,000 for an owner-occupied home or below $1,250 a month for a rental. The Des Moines Area Association of Realtors reported in December that the median home price in its listings was $229,000, while CBRE/Hubbell Commercial, a brokerage that tracks the industry, said median rent across the metro is $935 a month. Downtown, it is $1,189 per month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators aren’t ready to declare that marijuana possession never should be a felony, rejecting proposals Monday to lower penalties for third-time offenders and to release others from prison. The House Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee voted 7-4 against a bill that would make possessing marijuana a misdemeanor, no matter how many times someone was convicted. Kansas law currently says a third conviction is a felony that can be punished by up to 14 months in prison, though offenders often receive probation. The bill also initially said offenders now in prison for marijuana possession would be released, but the committee removed that provision from the measure. Supporters of lessening the penalties for repeated marijuana possession accepted the change to give the bill a better chance of passing. Yet the measure failed to clear the GOP-controlled committee anyway.\n\nKentucky\n\nCold Spring: A Northern Kentucky city has become the third municipality in 2020 to adopt a Fairness Ordinance. The leaders of Cold Spring, near Cincinnati, voted 4-1 on Monday night in favor of protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and other accommodations. Cold Spring is the fifth city in Northern Kentucky over the past year to pass such an ordinance, according to the Fairness Campaign. It’s the 19th such community in the commonwealth. Councilman Adam Sandfoss, who introduced the ordinance, said in a statement that “I’m proud of our city’s vote for equal rights tonight. We want folks to know Cold Spring is a community everyone can call home, and I hope our action will inspire more Northern Kentucky communities – maybe even Campbell County – to adopt similar protections for all their residents.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new group focused on Mardi Gras-season parade safety will begin work late this week or early next week, the police chief said Monday in discussing the city’s response to the recent deaths of two people in float-related accidents. Suggestions from family members of the victims and others – such as setting up barricades along the entire length of the parade routes, rather than only at major intersections, and mounting accordion barriers between sections of tandem floats – will be discussed, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told a news conference. Ferguson noted that setting up barricades along parade routes that are 5 to 7 miles long would be time-consuming and require many workers. He also said additional workers would be need to be on hand to move such barricades out of the way for any emergency vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker is hoping to pass a bill he said would protect children in the state from unauthorized surveillance by drones. The proposal from Rep. John Andrews of Paris would create a new state law the legislator said in a statement would “prevent unauthorized drone spying on a person in their domicile where they have an expectation of privacy.” Andrews is asking the state’s Legislative Council to allow his proposal to go through despite the fact a legislation deadline has passed. He said the law would establish penalties for people convicted of surveilling underage children. The Legislative Council is expected to discuss whether to consider the proposal this session on Thursday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Workers would be able to take 12 weeks off work to care for a new child or an ill family member through a new state-administered insurance pool that would provide partial wage replacement, under legislation that received a hearing in a House committee Monday. The measure would create a fund supported by weekly employer and employee contributions. Each would contribute half, based on a sliding scale. An employee with the state’s average wage would contribute $3.62 a week, said Del. Kris Valderrama, a Democrat sponsoring the bill. “It is limited in its scope, but it will allow people a brief respite and help to make ends meet, at least temporarily,” Valderrama said. But opponents said it would create the potential for up to 24 weeks off in some circumstances. Opponents said while they were not fully opposed to the concept, the Maryland measure was too burdensome.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A local museum has received a gift of more than 1,600 photographic works it says will enhance what is already one of the leading collections of Asian photography in the U.S. and Europe. The gift to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem comes from the Joy of Giving Something Foundation, known for its work that explores the intersection of photography and social issues. The collection features the works of 123 artists, primarily of Chinese and Japanese descent or who worked in eastern Asia, from 1930 to the present day. The museum already has a roughly 5,000-piece collection of 19th-century photography. “These photographs deepen our museum’s 220-year relationship with East Asian culture and offer a compelling complement to our historic collection of Asian photography,” Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, the museum’s deputy director, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that the state will have a mobility officer to coordinate all initiatives related to self-driving and connected cars, an effort she said will ensure Michigan is the go-to place for testing and producing vehicles of the future. While speaking at the MICHAuto Summit in Detroit, Whitmer signed an executive directive to create the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, effectively immediately. It will be led by a chief mobility officer whose name probably will be announced in April, Whitmer said. She also signed an executive order to establish the Michigan Council on Future Mobility and Electrification, an advisory group that will replace but function similarly to one created by a 2016 law. The council will be housed within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity instead of the Department of Transportation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Law enforcement officers should get better training in de-escalation skills and in dealing with people experiencing mental health crises, a working group on reducing police-involved deadly force encounters recommended Monday. Minnesota’s two highest-ranking black law enforcement officials – Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington – formed the working group last summer in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police officers, including those of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. Minnesota has had more than 100 officer-involved shootings over the past five years, Harrington said, adding that many members were surprised to learn 60% happened outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, affecting nearly every county in the state. Ellison said the group also learned that between 30% and 50% of the people killed in encounters with police were having mental health crises.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A routine road closure for a transportation worker turned into the quick delivery of a baby on the interstate. Wayne Evans, a superintendent with the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was getting ready to shut down a lane Monday morning on I-20 near Brandon when a car pulled up with its emergency lights flashing, and two women got out of the vehicle. “They were in desperate need for something,” Evans said in an interview shared online by MDOT. When Evans approached the car, he found a third woman in labor in the backseat. “It was going to happen pretty quick, and I knew they weren’t gonna make it to the hospital,” he said. So Evans got a first aid kit from his truck, put on a pair of gloves and helped deliver the baby boy. “He put his gloves on and got his umbilical cord from around his neck, and he helped me deliver,” new mom Desire’e Thomas told WAPT-TV. Evans said he believes his Marine Corps training kicked in.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new effort in St. Louis County will make the overdose-reversing antidote naloxone more readily available to the public, in hopes of reducing the high number of opioid overdose deaths in the state’s largest county. Democratic County Executive Sam Page on Monday announced details of a program that will make naloxone available free of charge to community groups and the public during regular business hours at the county’s John C. Murphy Health Center in Berkeley. County officials said the site was chosen because of its location in north St. Louis County, the area hit hardest by the epidemic. U.S. health officials believe the increasing availability of naloxone, commonly known under the brand name Narcan, is partly responsible for the first drop in overdose deaths in nearly 30 years.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: An investigation has started after seven trumpeter swans were found dead at a pond near the city, wildlife officials said. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks received a report of dead swans between the towns of Belgrade and Manhattan on Friday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Biologists and wardens collected the animals’ bodies Saturday, department spokesman Morgan Jacobson said. “We still don’t have a cause of death,” Jacobson said, adding that the agency has not ruled out any causes including poaching or the swans eating moldy grain. Trumpeter swans are on the state’s species of concern list, according to Montana Field Guides’ website. The list helps resource managers make decisions about species conservation and data collection priorities. Trumpeter swans are the largest waterfowl in North America, experts said. They can be up to 5 feet (in length, have a wingspan up to about 7 feet and weigh over 20 pounds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has been chosen to lead a team of universities and other partners in studying counterterrorism and terrorism prevention, federal officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Monday that the university has won a $3.65 million-a-year grant for 10 years. The university will spearhead a consortium of academic, industry, government and laboratory partners in trying to find ways to prevent or counteract threats to the nation’s people, infrastructure and economy, the directorate said. That consortium constitutes what the directorate describes as a center of excellence. It will be the directorate’s 10th center of excellence, said directorate spokesman John Verrico.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: State officials issued another marijuana health advisory regarding products that were on shelves at 30 dispensaries in Nevada last month. The Nevada Department of Taxation issued an advisory late Friday concerning 20 products that failed microbial testing conducted by an independent lab. The products were sold in the form of raw cannabis buds and raw cannabis that had been pre-rolled into a joint. The products came from six different cultivators in Nevada and failed a variety of mold, yeast and bacteria testing. All of the products were initially tested and passed by Cannex LLC, a Las Vegas marijuana testing lab that the taxation department suspended in December as part of an investigation. The products were on the shelves between Oct. 25 and Jan. 16 at dispensaries across the state. There are no known reports of illness, according to the taxation officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers are working on a bill that would require more insurance coverage for people in the state who get tick-borne disease testing. Rep. Megan Murray, a first-term Democrat from Amherst, said her constituents have told her that doctors often prioritize testing for Lyme disease after a tick bite, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Murray’s bill, which has bipartisan co-sponsors, would require insurers to cover additional advanced, broad tests that could catch Lyme and other more rare diseases. Murray said she hopes that testing for these diseases earlier will prevent delayed diagnoses, as well as lower costs for patients and insurers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHoboken: The city, one of the areas in the state hit hardest by Superstorm Sandy, is making progress toward completing a large public park that will double as a reservoir for nearly 2 million gallons of storm water to prevent it from flooding city streets. On Monday, officials announced the awarding of a $14 million federal grant to continue construction of the 5-acre park, which sits in the northwest corner of the city on the former site of a chemical plant, about a mile from the Lincoln Tunnel into New York. The project has been under construction for about five months and is expected to be completed in late 2022. The park will feature green space, athletic fields, an ice skating rink and other amenities. A 30-foot-deep underground tank will hold up to a million gallons of water that normally would collect in city streets, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It was the 1970s when the state last increased the amount of bond money that oil and gas companies are required to put up before drilling. As development continues at a record pace, State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says it’s time to take another look. Legislation that called for a study of the issue stalled during the recent session, but Garcia Richard announced just a day after lawmakers adjourned that she’s moving forward with the effort. She said her office has the funding to begin the work. The review could take months. Given all the infrastructure and development on state trust lands, officials said the amount of bonding needed to ensure taxpayers aren’t left paying for any cleanup and restoration after oil, gas or other minerals are extracted is currently unknown. Garcia Richard described it as an urgent issue that could leave “taxpayers and our state trust land beneficiaries on the hook for potentially millions of dollars.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York State Police say they plan to go forward with a body camera pilot program for state troopers, a move that would change the agency’s status as one of the few primary state law enforcement agencies in the nation without body or dashboard cameras. Kevin Bruen, first deputy superintendent of the New York State Police, disclosed the plan for a pilot program Monday at the state Capitol. He did not provide details of the plan, such as how many troopers will receive the devices and how much money the pilot program might cost. Patrol cameras are regularly praised by law enforcement experts as ways to increase transparency and hold officers and citizens accountable. Equipping state police with body cameras has received support from New York Attorney General Letitia James. Some state lawmakers have also expressed support for bringing the technology to the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in 2016 to limit the power of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper before he could take office now want the state’s highest court to hear their case. Lawyers for Common Cause and ten citizens filed an appeal petition with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, about a month after the Court of Appeals upheld the legality of the three-day session in December 2016. Republicans in charge of the House and Senate approved a pair of measures during the session that weakened Cooper’s power as governor. Those who sued said the fleetness of GOP leaders calling the session and pushing through legislation violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to “instruct their representatives.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A city building dubbed Sandbag Central will soon be open for business as Fargo leaders prepare for spring flooding along the Red River, the city administrator said Monday night. Bruce Grubb told city commissioners of plans to fill 250,000 sandbags in order to protect the city to 41 feet, which would be 23 feet over flood stage. The latest outlook from the National Weather Service shows a 10% probability that the river will reach 39 feet in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area. KFGO radio reports Grubb called the chance of a severe flood “a flip of the coin” and said the city would rather “err on the side of caution.” Volunteers filled hundreds of thousands of sandbags last year for anticipated flooding that never materialized. Sandbag Central is located in a building that is normally a parking garage for garbage trucks. Plans are to begin sandbag operations March 10.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: Two cheetah cubs have been born through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer to a surrogate mother for the first time, zoo officials announced Monday. The male and female cubs were born to 3-year-old Izzy at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium on Wednesday, the zoo said in a statement. A team observed the births through a remote camera and is continuing to monitor Izzy and the cubs. The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi, who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally. Kibibi’s eggs were extracted and then fertilized in a Columbus Zoo laboratory Nov. 19. The early-stage embryos were implanted into Izzy on Nov. 21, and an ultrasound revealed she was pregnant with two fetuses about a month later. Dr. Randy Junge, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, said this development could have broader implications for managing the species’ population in the future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Children under the age of 17 would be required to wear seat belts in vehicle back seats under a bill narrowly passed Monday by the state Senate. The bill, which passed on a 25-22 vote, changes current law that requires only children younger than age 8 to wear seat belts in the back seat. “The bottom line is children are being hurt and dying simply because we don’t require them to wear a seat belt,” said Sen. Roland Pederson, a Burlington Republican. Pederson said Oklahoma is the nation’s only state that does not require seat belts for children older than age 8. The measure now heads to the House, where a similar bill is pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: House Republicans walked out from the state Capitol on Tuesday, joining their Senate colleagues in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill. “Oregon House Republicans are taking a stand, with working families, in opposing cap and trade and this rigged process,” House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, said in a statement. House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she has and will continue to make an effort toward compromise, but that isn’t possible if Republicans are not in the Capitol. In a stream of statements released Tuesday morning, House Republicans cited the process of crafting Senate Bill 1530, as well as the policy itself, as their reasons for leaving. Republicans have said SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say that cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state’s carbon emissions and that the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An inmate awaiting trial in a shooting case wants a federal judge to release him from solitary confinement in a central Pennsylvania county jail, where he has been confined for more than a year because he refuses to cut dreadlocks that hold religious significance for him. The hand-written lawsuit filed in October by Eric S. McGill Jr. against three senior administrators at the Lebanon County Correctional Facility shifted gears last week, when a set of lawyers produced an amended complaint that warned McGill’s mental health is deteriorating. It said McGill, 27, of Lebanon, an adherent of Rastafarianism, suffers anxiety attacks two or three times a week, and they are usually triggered by thoughts of his jail conditions and placement in solitary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two state lawmakers are proposing to raise taxes on residents earning more than $500,000 annually to pay for education. Democratic state Sen. Ryan Pearson, of Cumberland, and Democratic Rep. Gregg Amore, of East Providence, are proposing a new tax bracket for income earned higher than $500,000. It would add 1 percentage point to the 5.99% top rate, with incremental revenue directed to an account for funding education from kindergarten through grade 12, they said. They emphasized that their proposal would not affect any resident earning less than $500,000 annually. Amore said the state needs a commitment of resources to pay for reforms to the education system. Pearson said that by asking the top 1% of earners in Rhode Island to contribute more, there will be funding to ensure that all Rhode Islanders can get a good education.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An April performance by the Hong Kong Ballet at the Peace Center has been canceled due to concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. The ballet was set to perform “ALICE (in wonderland)” on April 21 with the help of dozens of local ballet students. The company postponed its upcoming U.S. tour due to the virus. Hong Kong Ballet Artistic Director Septime Webre said the group is putting the health and safety of its dancers and the general public first but is committed to returning to South Carolina in the coming seasons. Auditions were held in late January to choose local ballet students to fill roles in the show, and rehearsals had already begun. Anyone who’s already purchased tickets will automatically receive a refund based on their method of payment, according to a release from the Peace Center.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a proposal to stop schools from requiring students to get vaccinations. A House committee heard emotional testimony from parents on both sides of the issue but decided to effectively kill the bill, saying it would have resulted in decreased vaccination rates and could have caused outbreaks in vaccine-preventable diseases. Supporters of the bill said South Dakota is the first state Legislature this year to consider a proposal to end school vaccine requirements, but the issue is now being carried by lawmakers in a few other states. They hoped that despite the bill’s defeat, their doubts about vaccinations would gain credence in the state. Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the bill and told reporters last week that vaccinations have saved millions of lives. Doctors, as well as lobbyists from medical groups, hospitals, business groups, universities and schools, also lined up to testify against the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state on Monday set two new execution dates, days after putting to death its seventh inmate in the past year and a half. The Tennessee Supreme Court ordered an Oct. 8 execution date for Byron Black and a Dec. 3 execution date for Pervis Payne. Black was convicted by a Nashville court of murdering his girlfriend Angela Clay and her daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6, at their home in 1988. Prosecutors said he shot the three during a jealous rage. Black was on work release at the time for shooting and wounding Clay’s estranged husband. Payne was sentenced to death in Memphis for the 1987 fatal stabbing of Charisse Christopher and her daughter, Lacie Jo, in what prosecutors described as a “drug-induced frenzy.” Christopher’s son, Nicholas, who was 3 at the time, was stabbed but survived. Attorneys for the inmates have argued that both men are intellectually disabled and mentally ill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: This week the state Department of Transportation could approve a request from Gov. Greg Abbott to rent a state-owned temporary campsite for the homeless to an Austin nonprofit. But the residents have another idea: They want the governor to lease the property directly to them. In an open letter to Abbott, those who have taken shelter at the campsite they are calling Camp R.A.T.T., which stands for Responsible Adult Transition Town, said they would be willing to pay $1 a month per resident to rent the land. Abbott is offering a $1-a-month lease to ATX Helps, a nonprofit tied to the Austin Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Austin Alliance. “We believe this is a good idea for several reasons: it gives the residents here a sense of responsibility, and provides the basis of stewardship,” the letter said. “Also, we aren’t lazy and aren’t expecting a hand-out. It’s our intention to get back into the world.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Most abortions would be banned in the state under a new proposal at the Legislature – one that abortion-rights advocates say would create fear and uncertainty even though it wouldn’t be enforced unless the legal landscape changes. The proposal would make it a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison to perform an abortion except in cases of rape, incest or serious threat to the health of the mother. The bill contains a so-called trigger clause, so the measure wouldn’t go into effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion in the country. The trigger clause also means it likely could not be immediately challenged in court. Utah passed a ban after 18 weeks last year, and lawmakers are considering additional abortion-related proposal this year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a bill that would increase the minimum wage. The vote was 100 to 49. The Senate, which has a Democrat majority, voted 24-6 in favor of the veto override earlier this month. The original bill did not pass the Democrat-led House with the two-thirds margin that would be needed to override the governor’s veto, but some lawmakers changed their votes Tuesday. Scott has said that raising the minimum wage to $12.55 by 2022 could end up hurting the people it is intended to help.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A judge has hit the pause button on the city’s plans to remove a 175-year-old slave auction block from a downtown street corner. The Free Lance-Star reports Circuit Court Judge Sarah Deneke has agreed to a 15-day stay of her order to remove the block in Fredericksburg. Her order allows a business owner who is challenging the removal to ask the Virginia Supreme Court to take on the case. E.D. Cole Building LLC owns a commercial building across the street from the auction block. The firm and the owner of a nearby restaurant have argued that they’ll lose business from tourist traffic if the auction block is removed. The judge already ruled that city officials have the authority to approve the removal the block. The city had previously placed traffic cones around the block with plans to move it before the business owner urged the court to stop the city.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Weekly benefits under the state’s new paid family leave law are now taking up to 10 weeks to process because of the high number of people applying for the program. Under the law, eligible workers receive 12 weeks’ paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious medical condition of the worker or the worker’s family member, or 16 weeks for a combination of both. An additional two weeks may be used if there is a serious health condition with a pregnancy. Weekly benefits under the new law are calculated based on a percentage of the employee’s wages and the state’s weekly average wage – which is now $1,255 – though the weekly amount paid out is capped at $1,000. In the first six weeks since the program went live last month, more than 30,000 people have applied, more than triple the amount that was projected in that same time frame, according to the Washington Employment Security Department.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican state lawmakers moved forward Monday on a sweeping tax overhaul that could slash county government budgets, though it appears likely Democrats may derail the plan. Senators voted 17-16 to pass a GOP proposal to cut taxes on manufacturers and personal vehicles while raising sales taxes and taxes on tobacco products. But still looming is an accompanying resolution, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, to set the plan in motion. “This is a bad plan; it’s going to hurt West Virginians,” said Sen. Mike Romano, a Democrat from Harrison County. Many county leaders oppose the tax overhaul and worry it could result in the loss of millions of dollars in tax revenues that play an integral part of their budgets. Jonathan Adler, executive director of the West Virginia Association of Counties, said the plan raised the potential for devastating cuts to local law enforcement and courts.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Authorities say three people died in snowmobile accidents last weekend, boosting the number of deaths to 17 for the season. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said all three of the victims were from Illinois. Two of them died after striking trees, and one person was killed after being struck by another snowmobile rider. There have been nine fatalities this month. That includes a 15-year-old Wisconsin boy who failed to stop at an intersection of a public trail and highway and collided with a car, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who struck a fence on private land and a 29-year-old woman who struck several trees. Alcohol, excess speed and driver inexperience are the leading causes of snowmobile accidents, according to the DNR.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The National Park Service is about to begin facility and trail work totaling almost $4 million in Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming. The work will include making an overlook trail more accessible to people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations. Plans also call for improving access to restrooms, a visitor center and a trail to the base of Devils Tower. Parking lots, visitor center exhibits and trail signs also will see improvements. Funding will come from a variety of sources including a portion of entrance fees, the Gillette News-Record reports. “It’s been a long time planned and a long time coming to make sure that all these funding sources came together for us,” said Nick Myers, the national monument’s chief of interpretation. Work is expected to begin this week, weather permitting, and should be done by November, Myers said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/12/why-hamburger-could-kill-you-but-apple-probably-wont/1538006002/", "title": "How to grill burgers properly: Doing it wrong could actually kill you", "text": "The backyard grilling season heats up Memorial Day weekend, but U.S. meat continues to come under fire.\n\nDealing with raw meat can be tricky, and not cooking it properly can be deadly.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, more than 62,000 pounds of raw beef products from Aurora Packing Co. of North Aurora, Illinois, were recalled due to concerns they may be contaminated with E. coli.

Also that month were two recalls linked to worries about pieces of plastic in food — more than 23,000 frozen beef patties by AdvancePierre Foods of Enid, Oklahoma, and 43,000-plus pounds of ground beef products by JBS Plainwell of a Plainwell, Michigan.\n\nWhat's the best place to hit the Heinz?

People want to cook raw food and prepare it at home. If you prepare it at home, you have to know there are some risks associated with it.\"\n\nThe hamburger, as national a food as apple pie, is the image this country has exported around the globe for half century. Equally iconic is meatloaf, a comfort food from June Cleaver that's made a hipster, deconstructed comeback. Meatball subs and meat-lovers pizza have a place at every football viewing party.\n\nThe beef industry says it's reducing foodborne pathogens at every stage of the supply chain.\n\n\"Since 1993, cattle farmers and ranchers have invested tens of millions of dollars in safety research programs and the industry as a whole invests over $500 million annually in beef safety research, testing and technology implementation,\" the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said in an e-mail. \"Nothing is more important to the beef industry than the safety of our consumers.\"\n\nHere's why the staple of the all-American diet from chuck wagons that fed the 19th century cowboys in the Wild West to the growing so-called \"better burger\" restaurants is so susceptible.\n\nHow many cows are in my burger?\n\nUnlike unprocessed produce or whole cuts of meat, ground beef is made up of bits and pieces from many different animals – each one with the potential to taint the whole batch.\n\n\"When you buy a chicken breast, how many animals is that? One. Ground beef? As many as 400 animals in commercially processed beef,\" said Northeastern University food safety expert Darin Detwiler. \"Unless you buy steak from the grocer and grind it up yourself, you're talking about Russian roulette.\"\n\nIf equipment isn't cleaned well between runs, the residue could contaminate the next production cycle, too.\n\nPotential for contamination at every step\n\nThe giant vats of mixed meat are just one part of the production process; multiple steps equals multiple potential problems. Each point along the way – from the farm to the finished product – is a chance for pathogens to enter.\n\nDetwiler says the trouble can begin when the cows are still alive – on corporate farms, in confined spaces and walking around in fecal matter, which is how many pathogens are transmitted.\n\nFrom there, they go to what are euphemistically called processing facilities.\n\n\"The slaughtering of animals is a very dirty process in ways tomatoes are not,\" said Brian Kellerman, a Columbus, Ohio-based food-safety consultant. \"It’s dirty in the field, but once you dig it out, you wash and that’s it. With animals, all the blood and innards required to be to removed has the potential to contaminate.\"\n\nHow much meat do we eat?\n\nThe expression \"meat and potatoes\" isn't used to mean \"basic\" for nothing. Meat is a fundamental part of what many of us eat daily from breakfast patties to late-night taco runs.\n\nAmericans will consume 59.1 pounds of beef per capita in 2018, according to the USDA's forecast. That's up from 54 pounds in 2015.\n\nChances are, it's in your fridge or freezer as you read this. This food is universal in a way that romaine lettuce, recalled last year in massive campaign from Yuma, Ariz., isn't. Its pervasiveness in our diets makes it harder to root out.\n\nA greater risk\n\nMore is at stake when it comes to chopped steak. E. coli can kill people, especially children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. The Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak in 1993 brought the issue into the national consciousness, as more than 700 people got sick and four children died. In the interim quarter of a century, Americans have become more knowledgeable about foodborne illnesses – and other pathogens, such as listeria and salmonella.\n\n\"We have certain situations where we assume there's always a chance there’s a danger, but don’t ever have that awareness when comes to food,\" said Detwiler, whose 16-month-old son Riley was one of the Jack in the Box fatalities. \"It seems like there's a daily, weekly, monthly reminder of those rude awakenings. We have to start paying attention.\"\n\nA false sense of security\n\nTo avoid contracting a foodborne illness from fruits and vegetables, you wash them before eating, but ensuring your beef is safe to consume requires thorough cooking. Not everyone does that – or even knows how to.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises cooking ground beef to a minimum internal temperature of 160°F and always using a food thermometer to make sure it's hit that heat threshold.\n\nLeaving this vital part of food safety – what experts call the kill step – up to laypeople in their kitchens and backyards is perilous. The USDA's Rottenberg said the department is trying to improve on that.\n\n\"There's more work to be done on the public education front,\" she said, adding that the department also is conducting studies on what people really do behind closed doors while cooking.\n\nNot every home chef or griller has a meat thermometer, and eyeballing ground beef is unreliable. Searing it on the outside, which is acceptable for a steak, doesn't work here, because the pathogen could be inside the burger. Another no-no is putting a cooked burger back on the plate you'd used for the raw meat. And be sure to wash your hands and sanitize all surfaces, including counter tops and cutting boards, after contact with raw meat.\n\n\"Any person who likes their hamburgers medium rare is taking an enormous risk. If it's contaminated beef, they will not reach a temperature that will get rid of the pathogen,\" Kellerman said. \"People's cooking skills may be deficient. They may not understand how to handle meats, even though it’s common knowledge.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/12"}]}

DOJ fights judge\n\nWASHINGTON – After President Donald Trump granted clemency to Oath Keepers militia founder Stewart Rhodes for his Jan. 6-related conviction, a federal judge ordered Rhodes on Friday to stay away from the U.S. Capitol now that he is out of prison.\n\nWithin hours, the Justice Department – which under the Biden administration had secured Rhodes' 2022 conviction – argued that Judge Amit Mehta didn't have the authority to issue that restriction. Trump commuted Rhodes' 18-year sentence Monday along with the sentences of 13 other defendants. He also pardoned roughly 1,500 defendants who faced Jan. 6-related charges.\n\nRhodes left a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, on Tuesday and by Wednesday, he had visited Capitol Hill. Mehta issued his brief order, which also applied to seven other defendants whose sentences were commuted Monday, following that visit.\n\nThe order states that all eight defendants need Mehta's permission to visit the Capitol in particular as well as Washington, D.C. in general.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department said in its motion that the commutation of Rhodes' sentence means he is no longer subject to the terms of probation or a supervised release from prison.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Quite a day': Devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood abuzz ahead of Trump visit\n\nLOS ANGELES – Activity buzzed outside Fire Station No. 69 in the Pacific Palisades late Friday morning in anticipation of President Trump’s arrival to inspect the wildfire damage.\n\nThe throng gathered less than a block from burned-down neighborhoods included members of the Secret Service, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Teddy’s Tacos.\n\n“It’s quite a day,’’ said Teddy Vasquez, 39, surveying the scene near his taco truck that has been serving free food outside the firehouse since less than 72 hours after the fires broke out Jan. 7. “Firefighters left their homes to be out here. The least I could do is come out here and feed them.’’\n\nWith Trump expected to arrive by helicopter at about 2:30 p.m. local time, law enforcement walked along nearby Fiske Street, a demolished block of homes that Trump is expected to survey after an aerial tour of the ruin.\n\nAlso, banquet tables have been set up inside the fire department for an emergency briefing that will include the president. Fire captain Jeff Brown, a key participant in the activities, declined comment.

He began moving five vehicles from around the house to a road about one-third of a mile away, as the floodwaters began to rise.\n\nWhen the water was ankle-deep inside the house, he retreated to a loft. When the water reached their hips, he made a makeshift ladder to climb onto the roof.\n\nHe spent four hours on the roof writing farewell notes on his cellphone to his two children and his two grandchildren as debris from the storm floated past. His garage floated away before the water crested at about 4 feet high on the roof.\n\n“We didn’t think we were going to make it at all,” Bright said. “We were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘Horrific’: Fairview resident tells Trump of flood and bodies\n\nMona Nix-Roper, who lives in the Fairview area of North Carolina, told President Trump her home became like an island in September as floodwaters from Hurricane Helene rose around it.\n\nShe was home alone because her husband was staying with a 98-year-old neighbor to make sure she was alright. When Nix went out to check the road and bridge that provide access to her home, she found they were gone.\n\nFire Department officials urged her the next day to evacuate because of the risk of landslides. Her 21-year-old son Nathan hiked in five miles after roads became impassable to help her leave.\n\n“He said, ‘Mom, grab a bag, we’ve got to go,’” Nix said. “I said, ‘Son, there’s no way I can hike out of here.’ He said, ‘No, we’ve got to go.’”\n\nAs they walked out, they saw a neighbor’s body that had turned blue in the water.\n\n“Horrific is just all I can say,” Nix said. “There were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones. And there were dead bodies. My son’s like, ‘Mom, you’re going to see things you don’t want to see.’”\n\nNix’s home was without power for two months, so she lived in her church’s sound room. Others had lost everything, so she said she is embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n“We need help,” Nix said. “It’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump appeared moved.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of bad things, but I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump thanks March for Life activists via video\n\nWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, President Trump on Friday said a “historic wrong was set right” thanks to the “tireless work and devotion across five decades” of anti-abortion rights activists as he addressed March for Life rallygoers at the National Mall.\n\n“Three years ago, I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\n\nIn his second term, Trump said he would “stand proudly for families and for life.”\n\n“Under my leadership, the reformed Department of Justice will finally investigate the radical left attacks on churches and crisis pregnancy centers, and we will bring perpetrator to justice,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPastor describes generosity of volunteers helping recovery\n\nPastor Ramona Nix told President Trump she had dedicated her Eagle Rock, North Carolina church a week before the storm arrived with Hurricane Helene in September.\n\nNix stayed in the church building for three months, sleeping on the floor for three weeks, because the community’s needs were so great. Her son ferried supplies in, Nix said.\n\n“Before the week was over, the church was so packed, we couldn’t even walk,” Nix said. “Even our sanctuary, it was up to the platform.”\n\nVolunteers arrived from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Oklahoma to help with the recovery. “They were coming in day and night,” Nix said.\n\nAt one point, Nix asked a woman who arrived if she could do anything special for her.\n\n“She said, ‘I don’t want to be selfish, but could I have a cup of coffee,’” Nix said. “I handed her that coffee and she stood there. Tears just poured. She said, ‘You don’t realize how important the little things.’ It’s not the big things in life that we have, but it’s the little things.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\n‘I didn’t think I was going to make it’: NC victim to Trump\n\nKim West described her harrowing escape from her home as it flooded from Hurricane Helene in September, as President Trump visited the storm-ravaged Swannanoa, North Carolina.\n\nAs the river waters rose near their house, Kim and her husband Chris West started moving vehicles to higher ground along the road. By then, water was ankle deep inside the house. Kim West grabbed her purse and pug dog, and Chris West put dog food in a trash bag.\n\n“By the time we got into the driveway, it was already waist deep,” West said. “I didn’t think I was going to make it.”\n\nThey were stuck on local roads for hours because of flooding. The waters finally receded about midnight, after they began evacuating at 5 a.m.\n\n“We just lost everything that we had,” West said. “Didn’t even have a brush for like three days.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nThune and Johnson address March for Life rallygoers\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday addressed the annual March for Life rally at the National Mall in Washington, saying the anti-abortion rights protesters were “not alone.”\n\n“You are part of a great movement united around the truth. That every life is precious,” he said. “I stand with you in this fight and so do many of my colleagues in Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., talked about being a “product of an unplanned teen pregnancy\" born in 1972, one year before abortion was legalized when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n\n“I am so eternally grateful that my mom and dad ignored all the people who told them to just take care of that problem,” he said. “They chose to embrace life and to have me the first of their four children.”\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump granted pardons to 23 anti-abortion rights activists.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump suggests abolishing FEMA\n\nPresident Trump ratcheted up his criticism with the suggestion he might abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of its response in North Carolina to lingering damage from Hurricane Helene in September.\n\n“I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe even getting rid of FEMA,” Trump said after a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina. “Frankly, FEMA’s not good.”\n\nTrump accused FEMA crews of being unfamiliar with areas when responding to disasters. FEMA also imposes rules and requirements on crews that aren’t as good as what local officials provide, Trump said. The federal government should instead send funding to governors to manage their own response to disasters, he said.\n\n“FEMA has turned out to be a disaster,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly – we pay a percentage to the state.”\n\nAfter speaking with flood victims in Swannanoa, North Carolina, Trump later added, “If it was up to me right now, I’d end it right now.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nPolitics shadow Trump's visit to North Carolina\n\nGlimpses of the politics behind disaster aid were visible as President Trump visited North Carolina to review damage from Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump recalled a whistleblower reported that Federal Emergency Management Agency crews refused to help people with Trump's 2024 presidential campaign signs in their yards. “That’s not good,” the president said.\n\nTrump noted that North Carolina and adjoining Tennessee each supported him in the last election – the Volunteer State slightly more.\n\nThe president also called for California to adopt voter ID, to ensure the citizenship of voters, to receive disaster aid for its wildfires around Los Angeles.\n\nThroughout his comments at a briefing in Fletcher, North Carolina, Trump cited problems with former President Joe Biden’s response to the disaster that left 104 people in North Carolina dead, 73,000 homes severely damaged or destroyed and Asheville without running water for two months.\n\n“It doesn’t matter at this point: Biden did a bad job,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTennessee governor thanks Trump for helping Appalachia\n\nTennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, whose state abuts North Carolina and was also damaged by Hurricane Helene, attended President Trump’s briefing on the disaster and thanked him.\n\n“The people in this region – including Tennessee, the people of Appalachia – are grateful that you are here and that you haven’t forgotten them,” Lee said. “There are other disasters. This was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.”\n\nTrump joked about which state gave him more votes. “I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee,\" the president said.\n\nLee said one of the counties hurt in the disaster supported Trump with 88% of the vote.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says Anthony Fauci can hire his own security\n\nPresident Trump said the federal security detail for Dr. Anthony Fauci, a former head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, had been removed Thursday because it can’t last a lifetime and he could hire his own protection.\n\nFauci led the federal health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to harsh criticism from Republicans about studies of the origin of the disease and the lockdowns to combat it during the first year.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump told reporters while visiting storm-damaged North Carolina. “You can’t have them forever.”\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also lost their security details during the first week of his administration.\n\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security, too,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nNC Reps. Edwards, Foxx and Moore to help lead recovery\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, announced he would help guide recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene with three House Republicans from the region with the most damage.\n\nThe lawmakers are GOP Reps. Chuck Edwards, Virginia Foxx and Tim Moore.\n\nTrump announced that Whatley would lead the recovery effort with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wants voter ID in California for disaster aid\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday he would like to see two changes in California – the adoption of voter ID and the redirection of water from the northern part of the state to the south – in exchange for disaster aid for wildfires.\n\nTrump said he wanted voter identification to ensure the citizenship of voters. He also repeated his complaint that the state should divert funding from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Los Angeles to fight fires.\n\n“I want two things,” Trump told reporters upon his arrival in Asheville, North Carolina. “After that, I will be the greatest president California has ever seen.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says OPEC lowering oil prices is key to stopping war in Ukraine\n\nTrump said his proposal for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce the price of oil is key to stopping the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We want to see OPEC cut the price of oil and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine,” Trump said in Asheville, North Carolina. “It’s a butchering tragedy, for both sides, by the way.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said a key to stopping the war is for OPEC to cut its prices because “if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.”\n\n“OPEC ought to get on the ball and they ought to drop the price of oil and that war will stop right away,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump offers ‘a lot of money’ to NC, overhaul of FEMA\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, that the federal government would supply “a lot of the money” to repair damage from floods and landslides after Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump also proposed to overhaul the FEMA so that states respond to their own disasters rather than the federal government.\n\n“We’re going to fix it as fast as we can,” Trump said. “It’s a massive amount of damage.”\n\nTrump said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who is from North Carolina, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein would work on plans for demolition of damaged buildings and cleaning up debris. Trump said the federal government would probably provide 75% of the funding.\n\n“We’re going to supply the money, a lot of the money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would review “the whole concept of FEMA” because states such as Florida with hurricanes and Oklahoma with tornadoes are better at responding to disasters.\n\n“I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,” Trump said. “I think you’re going to find it a lot less expensive – less than half – and you’re going to get a much quicker response.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff ‘glad’ Trump will see devastation from wildfires\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a frequent critic of President Trump, said he’s glad Trump is visiting Los Angeles to tour the wildfire damage but that he and Sen. Alex Padilla have votes scheduled and couldn’t attend.\n\n“I’m glad that he’s going to see the devastation because I think, frankly, until you see it and the scope of it – whole neighborhoods gone block after block after block – it’s hard to wrap your head around,” Schiff told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nBut Schiff said he hoped Trump and congressional Republicans wouldn’t put conditions on funding for disaster aid.\n\n“We've never done that when it comes to our fellow citizens who are hurting,” Schiff said. “And California, frankly, has been the most generous state in terms of supporting our fellow citizens, whether they're in red states or blue when they face disaster.”\n\nSchiff said overhauling the Environmental Protection Agency and the FEMA, as Trump has suggested, are areas that could lead to bipartisan support.\n\n“All of that is ample ground to get together and make things happen,” Schiff said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he didn’t invite California Sen. Adam Schiff on trip\n\nPresident Trump said he didn’t invite Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Democratic critic, on the trip to areas of Los Angeles damaged by wildfires.\n\n“Is he going? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know,” Trump said. “You know, if he's going to be there it would be cheaper, but I didn't invite him. Somebody did.\"\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has asked that disaster aid for California not come with strings attached, after Republicans suggested potential restrictions on the funding. Schiff is a former member of the U.S. House who previously led the first impeachment of Trump over his dealings with Ukraine and has questioned whether his nominees to become Cabinet secretaries will act independently from him.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump said he will watch ‘March for Life’\n\nPresident Trump said he would be watching the “March for Life” in Washington as he traveled to North Carolina and California to visit disaster areas. He said Vice President JD Vance would represent the administration “very well.”\n\n“I’m going to be watching it,” Trump said. “He’s going to be representing us very well.”\n\nTrump also noted that he pardoned 23 people who he said were \"unjustly\" charged for protesting outside abortion clinics.\n\n“It was disgraceful what happened,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump calls DOD nominee Pete Hegseth ‘a good man’\n\nPresident Trump praised his nominee to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, as a “good man” but didn’t predict what would happen with his Senate confirmation vote scheduled for late Friday.\n\n“He’s a good man. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said. “I hope he makes it.”\n\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against limiting debate on the nomination. Trump also questioned whether Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would support Hegseth because Trump and McConnell have had disputes in the past.\n\n“I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: North Carolina was ‘allowed to fester’\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Friday morning outside the White House that he’s going to North Carolina because the state has been treated badly since Hurricane Helene and to California where he said the wildfires should have been extinguished already.\n\n“North Carolina is a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester. It should have been done months ago,” Trump said. “North Carolina has been treated very badly.”\n\nTrump will visit Los Angeles later in the day to hear about the wildfires.\n\n“We’re going to take a look at the fire if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow,” Trump said.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's travel schedule ‒ minute by minute\n\nPresident Trump left the White House by helicopter at 9:16 a.m. for his tour of disaster areas in North Carolina and California on Friday. Here’s where he is going (all times Eastern Standard Time):\n\n11 a.m. in Fletcher, N.C.: Trump will receive a briefing on the recovery from Hurricane Helene, which flooded much of western North Carolina in September. Participants include a handful of lawmakers, state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler; state House Speaker Dustin Hall; and Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse.\n\n12:05 p.m. in Swannanoa, N.C.: Trump meets with families affected by the hurricane. Participants include Ramona Nix, pastor of Eagle Rock Church; and people who received benefits from Samaritan’s Purse: homeowners Chris and Kim West; Thomas Bright and Jackie Mitchell; and Curtis A., Amber and Curtis B. Wright.\n\n1:15 p.m. Trump leaves Asheville Regional Airport on a flight to Los Angeles.\n\n5:40 p.m. Trump arrives at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n6:25 p.m. Trump tours the Pacific Palisades Neighborhood. Participants include Fire Capt. Jeff Brown; Jason Hing, chief deputy of emergency services for the Fire Department; and homeowners Mike and Gaby Shaw.\n\n7:05 p.m. Trump receives an emergency briefing in Pacific Palisades. Other participants include Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass; Ric Grenell, presidential envoy for special missions; Randy Moore, chief of the U.S. Forest Service; Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors; and Ed Ring, director of water and policy for the California Policy Center; and a dozen House members.\n\n8:20 p.m. Trump leaves for Los Angeles airport.\n\n8:50 p.m. Trump flights to Las Vegas, where he will spend the night.\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\n‘Deportation flights have begun’: White House press secretary\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday announced that Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants was underway.\n\n“Deportation flights have begun,” she wrote on X. “President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"\n\nLeavitt also included two photos of people boarding military aircraft.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Stein to meet Trump\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is planning to meet Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport during Trump’s visit to Western North Carolina, according to The Citizen-Times, a USA TODAY Network partner.\n\nEarlier in the week, Stein, a Democrat, said Trump’s planned visit to western North Carolina, which was ravaged by Tropical Storm Helene nearly four months ago, was “very good news” for the region’s residents. The storm killed more than 100 people across the state and caused an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to the latest estimate from the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management.\n\n‒ Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nWhat is Trump’s schedule today?\n\nTrump's disaster-area tour begins around 10 a.m. EST on his first trip away from Washington. First comes a late morning visit to hurricane-damaged Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nHe'll then be wheels up on Air Force One in the early afternoon, heading west to Los Angeles and Santa Monica to visit areas ravaged by multiple wildfires. Trump is expected to reach California around 6:15 p.m. EST.\n\nThe president ends his Friday with a flight to Las Vegas, where he'll spend the night before hosting a downtown rally on Saturday. Trump won Nevada in 2024 after losing it four years earlier, and he recently told reporters he wanted to “thank them for the votes.”\n\nA video message from the president will also play at the annual March for Life rally by anti-abortion advocates on Capitol Hill this morning. Vice President JD Vance will address the crowd during the rally in his first public appearance in his new role.\n\n‒ Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJudge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional'\n\nA federal judge in Seattle on Thursday blocked Trump's administration from implementing an executive order curtailing the right to automatic birthright citizenship in the United States, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour at the urging of four Democratic-led states issued a temporary restraining order preventing the administration from enforcing the order, which the Republican president signed on Monday during his first day in office.\n\nThe order has already become the subject of five lawsuits by civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general from 22 states, who call it a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n– Reuters\n\nTrump's CIA director confirmed\n\nThe Senate easily confirmed CIA Director John Ratcliffe with a bipartisan 74-25 vote Thursday afternoon, making him the second of Trump’s cabinet picks to clear the chamber after Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nRatcliffe previously served as the director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration.\n\n– Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-the-key-races-to-watch-in-all-50-states/75674463007/", "title": "Election 2024: The key races to watch in all 50 states", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nElection Day will be about more than just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nThough the presidential election is commanding the most attention, a host of down-ballot races across the country will determine control of Congress, the direction of state legislatures and major policy battles on issues such as abortion rights and marijuana.\n\nHouse races in states like Arizona, Alaska and California will determine control of the control of the 435-seat House, where Democrats seek to upend the current 220-212 GOP majority. Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/29/trump-agenda47-crime-policy-proposal/74517501007/", "title": "Agenda47 on crime: Trump proposes death penalty for drug dealers:", "text": "Former president Donald Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention covered a lot of territory, but left out several of his policy objectives for a potential second term.\n\nAgenda47 is Trump's official campaign platform for the 2024 election.

CCJ CEO and president Adam Gelb says there are three factors to consider in assessing how effective a policy might be in deterring crime from happening in the first place:\n\n\"It's about certainty, swiftness and severity,\" Gelb said, explaining that severity undercuts certainty and swiftness. \"If we put anywhere near as much energy into increasing certainty and swiftness as we do into increasing severity, we'd be much safer, and I think fairer too.\"\n\nHere is a look at some of Trump's policy proposals to address crime in the U.S.\n\n'I'm not going to be nice:' Donald Trump launches all-out attack on Kamala Harris\n\nInvest in police officers\n\n\"President Trump will sign a record investment in hiring, retention, and training for police officers.

Ohio, which ruled police can stop and pat down someone without probable cause for arrest if they believe the person is armed. In 2013, stop and frisk in New York was found to disproportionately target Black and Latino New Yorkers, and a federal judge ruled it violated their constitutional rights. Trump also suggested stop and frisk for Chicago in a 2018 speech. Gelb said requiring local police departments to implement the policy would to be a dramatic expansion of federal power over police governance.\n\nThe \"Terry Stop,\" is based on the 1968 case Terry v.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has reached settlements with several cities to limit stop-and-frisk, says it is ineffective, disproportionately used against people of color, decreases community trust in police and leads to people of color reporting crimes less often.\n\nDeath penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers\n\n\"President Trump will instruct the Department of Justice to dismantle every gang, street crew, and drug network in America. President Trump has also called for the death penalty for drug dealers and human traffickers.\"\n\nPolicy evolution in the U.S: Twenty-one states in the U.S. have the death penalty, 23 do not have the death penalty, and six have put executions on hold. After a 2008 Supreme Court case held that the death penalty should only be used for the worst offenses, no one is on death row for a crime other than murder, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Still, the U.S. is in the global minority of countries that use the ultimate punishment. In today's context: The U.S. is in a decade-long overdose epidemic that is currently largely driven by fentanyl and other substances. The DPIC reported 24 executions in 2023, compared to more than 18,900 drug trafficking cases in the same year that were reported to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which studies federal sentencing practices.\n\nTarget 'Marxist' courts without cash bail\n\n\"President Trump will take on the radical Marxist prosecutors who have abolished cash bail and refuse to charge criminals.\"\n\nPolicy evolution in the U.S.: A 2022 report showed 60% of people awaiting trial were in jail because they could not afford bail, but the solution is highly debated. Advocates of removing the cash bail system say it creates disparities in the criminal justice system because low-income defendants may have to wait behind bars for their trial, arguing instead that pre-trial detention should be based on risk to the community. Others believe cash bail is necessary to keep some skin in the game for defendants to show up for court proceedings.\n\nA 2022 report showed 60% of people awaiting trial were in jail because they could not afford bail, but the solution is highly debated.

In the last few years, a court decision in California has curtailed the traditional role of bail, and some cities have worked on further reforms. In 2023, Illinois became the first state to abolish cash bail.\n\nDisciplining minors\n\n\"President Trump will order the Education and Justice Departments to overhaul federal standards on disciplining minors...Many of these carjackers and criminals are 13, 14, and 15 years old.

The deadline has passed for any potential owners to claim the wreckage of the wooden schooner, which was burned near Mobile after illegally bringing about 110 captives to Alabama from Africa in 1860. Because no one claimed the ship’s remains, the state can now move forward in federal court to take permanent possession. Researchers identified the wreckage of the ship earlier this year north of Mobile. Officials say they’re unsure how much of the Clotilda remains, but they believe at least some of the hull could be intact in the muddy bottom of the Mobile River near an island. It’s unclear what might be done with the wreckage or whether it can be raised.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A pastor wearing a colander on his head offered the opening prayer on behalf of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to open a local government meeting, the latest blessing from a nontraditional church since a court ruling. Barrett Fletcher, the Pastafarian pastor, noted the duties performed by the members of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly in his Tuesday message, adding a few of them “seem to feel they can’t do the work without being overseen by a higher authority, “ Kenai radio station KSRM reports. “So I’m called to invoke the power of the true inebriated creator of the universe, the drunken tolerator of the all lesser and more recent gods, and maintainer of gravity here on earth. May the great Flying Spaghetti Monster rouse himself from his stupor and let his noodly appendages ground each assembly member in their seats,” Fletcher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Progressive Democrats want their party to censure Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, saying she’s not standing up to President Donald Trump. Dan O’Neal of the Arizona Democratic Party Progressive Caucus told ABC15 that the party’s liberal wing wants Sinema “to vote like a Democrat rather than supporting Trump half the time.” A proposed censure resolution cites Sinema’s vote to confirm Trump’s Cabinet appointees, including Attorney General William Barr and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. It also cites her failure to support “net neutrality” legislation that requires internet companies to treat content equally. Sinema was a liberal member of the Arizona Legislature but has moved closer to the political center as a member of Congress. Democratic state committee members may consider the resolution at a meeting Saturday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The City Board is extending a program that pays minimum wage to homeless people who pick up litter. KATV reports that the board’s unanimous vote Tuesday approved an ordinance for $160,000 to fund the Bridge to Work program for one more year to determine its effectiveness. The money will pay for wages, transportation and supplies. The initiative that began six months ago aims to help homeless people in Little Rock. More than 450 participants have so far cleaned up 130 sites, gathering over 2,000 bags of trash. The Canvas Community Church, which runs the program, says 13 people have landed full-time jobs since the program began. City board member Kathy Webb says the program is exciting because it gives people the opportunity to work and move into homes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The University of California is dumping fossil fuel investments from its nearly $84 billion pension and endowment funds, calling them a financial risk. An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times says UC will make its endowment fund “fossil free” by month’s end, and its pension fund – which covers 320,000 people – will soon follow. The article was written by the university’s treasurer and the chair of its Board of Regents Investment Committee. A global campaign for universities and other organizations to disinvest has been waged by climate activists for nearly a decade, but the article says the decision was made for financial rather than political reasons. The article says UC is placing bets “that clean energy will fuel the world’s future.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The mayor is proposing to set a $15-an-hour minimum wage in the city by 2021. The Denver Post reports Mayor Michael Hancock and Councilwoman Robin Kneich were formally announcing the proposal Thursday. The full City Council would have to approve before it becomes official. The statewide minimum is $11.10, rising to $12 next year. A new state law allows cities to set their own rates. The federal minimum is $7.25, but the U.S. Department of Labor says 29 states and the District of Columbia have higher rates, up to $14. The Denver proposal would reach the $15 amount in two steps, at the beginning of 2020 and 2021. Hancock already has raised the minimum wage for city employees and contractors to $15 an hour.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A police officer says in a lawsuit that he was discriminated against by his department because of his facial tattoos. The New Haven Register reports Officer Jason Bandy sued city police this week. His attorney says the department has “no rules, regulations or policies” regarding tattoos or body art, and no women in the department have been disciplined because of piercings, makeup, jewelry or other items. Chief Otoniel Reyes said the department cannot comment on personnel matters or on pending litigation. The former chief recommended firing Bandy because the tattoos violated a general order requiring officers to “present a neat and clean appearance.” Bandy agreed to cover the tattoos while on duty. According to a previous Register story, the tattoos include a Latin phrase, date and the letter “D.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Christiana Care Health System, the state’s largest private employer, will begin offering paid parental leave to its employees for the first time. Christiana officials announced Wednesday that the system will grant at least 12 weeks of paid parental leave to its 12,000 employees for parents to use during the birth, adoption or fostering of their child. Employees told the news outlet that they previously had to use paid time off, disability leave, and benefits from the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law that entitles employees to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Last year the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation granting state employees 12 weeks of paid family leave. The state government is Delaware’s largest employer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An organization advocating for low-wage immigrants has filed a legal challenge to a Trump administration rule that may deny green cards to immigrants who use public services. Georgetown Law School’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and CASA filed a legal challenge in U.S. federal court this week. Lawyers say changes to the so-called public charge rule violate due process under the U.S. Constitution. Federal law already requires those seeking to become permanent residents or gain legal status to prove they will not be a burden to the U.S. – a “public charge,” in government speak. But the new rules detail a broader range of programs that could disqualify them, including Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Florida Power & Light plans to install 1,000 electric-charging stations at 100 locations across the state. The utility says the stations would be located on major roadways; at public parks, shopping malls and tourist destinations; and at major employers, such as Office Depot in Boca Raton. FPL spokeswoman Alys Daly told the South Florida SunSentinel she didn’t have a cost estimate. The charging stations would go through regulatory approval in Tallahassee as part of a future cost-recovery filing with the Florida Public Service Commission. The company’s chargers are universal, compatible with all electric cars, as well as plug-in hybrids. President and CEO Eric Silagy said it’s part of the company’s plan to move toward more sustainable energy sources.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: Coastal Georgia is gearing up for its annual food festival dedicated to deciding who cooks the state’s best shrimp and grits. Organizers expect more than 45,000 visitors for the Jekyll Island Shrimp & Grits Festival that kicks off Friday. The festival’s main attraction is a Saturday showdown between chefs from eight Georgia restaurants in a contest of shrimp-and-grits recipes. This year’s kitchen battle features returning champions from Eagle Creek Brewing Company of Statesboro and Atlanta’s West Egg Cafe. The weekend at Jekyll Island also includes a craft brew fest, an artists’ market and a kids’ zone. Attendees looking to burn off their extra calories will have a chance as the festival hosts its first 5K road race on a course through Jekyll Island’s historic district.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials say emergency sirens were accidentally activated on Oahu during a police training exercise. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday that the sirens went off during Honolulu Police Department training. Police issued an alert shortly after the 5 p.m. false alarm saying there was no emergency. Residents heard the siren in areas near downtown Honolulu. The episode echoed the moment last year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency mistakenly sent an alert about an incoming ballistic missile to cellphones and broadcast stations in Hawaii. The agency didn’t trigger emergency sirens during the false missile alert, though some military bases turned on theirs. The false missile alert was also issued during a training exercise.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State health officials say a cat has tested positive for rabies for the first time in 27 years. The Department of Health and Welfare says the cat in Owyhee County was behaving aggressively and bit its owner. It tested positive for a strain of rabies normally associated with bats. The department’s state public health veterinarian, Dr. Leslie Tengelsen, said in a prepared statement that rabies is fatal virtually 100% of the time. She said the cat was likely exposed to a rabid bat, and that’s how it became infected. Tengelsen said pet owners should vaccinate their dogs, cats, ferrets and horses against the disease. Ten bats have tested positive for rabies in Idaho this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Four Wheaton College students have sued the city, claiming rules for a popular park undercut the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. Earlier this year, Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events divided Millennium Park into 11 sections and prohibited “the making of speeches and passing out of written communications” in 10 of them. Millennium Park is home to Cloud Gate, better known as The Bean, by British artist Anish Kapoor. Plaintiffs’ attorney John Mauck says because it is a major tourist attraction, “that’s where you want to get your message out.” Chicago Law Department spokesman Bill McCaffrey says Millennium Park rules “protect First Amendment rights while also respecting the rights of patrons to use and enjoy the park.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Dave Schweikert has been going around in circles for weeks – training to break a record and ride his bicycle around a roundabout for 24 hours straight. His Friday ride will be the last of a series of events hosted by the city in celebration of National Roundabout Week, set by the Federal Highway Administration. Schweikert’s long trip to nowhere is for a good cause: The 51-year-old Noblesville resident hopes to raise money for World Bicycle Relief. The international nonprofit organization focuses on large-scale, comprehensive bicycle distribution programs to aid poverty relief in developing countries around the world. Schweikert’s ride is set for 7 p.m. at Carmel’s first roundabout at Main Street and River Road. He hopes to finish by 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: More than 200 scientists from 38 colleges and universities in the state have signed on to a climate change statement that warns of “sobering extreme heat projections” for the Midwest that will put people, livestock and pets at risk. The statement released Wednesday says the World Meteorological Association identified July as the hottest month in more than 140 years of record-keeping. The scientists say the atmosphere and earth’s surface are warming at an unprecedented rate, and by mid-century temperatures in Iowa will exceed 90 degrees for 67 days per year, compared to the average of 23 days in recent decades. Peter Thorne, director of the University of Iowa Environmental Health Sciences Research Center, says adaptations will include expanded disaster preparedness, increased energy use, and curtailment of outdoor work and recreation during times of extreme heat.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A Johnson County school district has voted to add LGBTQ protections to its nondiscrimination policy. The Shawnee Mission school board voted unanimously Monday night to adopt the LGBTQ language. It joins nearby districts in Olathe, Blue Valley and De Soto, who have added similar language. The Kansas City Star reports the vote came after 10 residents spoke against changing the policy, while a handful of others supported the proposal. Board member Deb Zila said she believed the change reflected the district’s practice of welcoming all children and trying to accommodate them as best it can. Opponents said they feared that schools are teaching students about sexuality at too young of an age or that transgender students might be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nKentucky\n\nElizabethtown: Officials say this central Kentucky city is set to become the state’s first urban trail town. The News-Enterprise reports the title will go to Elizabethtown for its Greenbelt Trails system, and officials plan to recognize the accomplishment with a ceremony Oct. 1. Elizabethtown Trail Town Advisory Board member Matt Deneen says the state Department of Tourism developed the new classification as a blueprint for expanding its Trail Town program into urban centers around Kentucky. Most communities now in the Trail Town program are in the state’s coal fields. The program was originally designed to help promote adventure tourism in rural communities, but now it is moving into urban areas. Elizabethtown’s Greenbelt Trails network features 16 trails, including the Freeman Lake Trail.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The federal government has declared agricultural disasters in two of the state’s parishes because of floods during the past year. A news release Wednesday says farmers in another 11 adjacent parishes can also apply for low-interest emergency loans. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says flooding between Sept. 1, 2018, and July 17 made Catahoula Parish a primary disaster area. Farmers and ranchers in Avoyelles, Caldwell, Concordia, Franklin, LaSalle and Tensas can also apply for Farm Service Agency loans to recover from those floods. Vermilion Parish received the designation for rain and floods June 5-15. Adjacent parishes under that declaration are Acadia, Cameron, Iberia, Jefferson Davis and Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nDover-Foxcroft: The director of the Baxter State Park Authority is floating the idea dropping the “Mount” from “Mount Katahdin.” Eben Sypitkowski told Piscataquis County Commissioners in an email that Katahdin gets its name from an Abenaki or Penobscot term that means “greatest mountain.” Therefore, he said, there’s no need for the word “Mount.” He said that’s redundant, like calling it “Mount Greatest Mountain.” He wrote that he applied to the USGS Board of Geographic Names for a name change of the summit. He said he wanted feedback on a township that also bears the Mount Katahdin name. The proposal was met with skepticism. Chairman James White said Thursday the commissioners aren’t convinced the change is necessary – especially considering the cost of changing maps and signs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Motorists are being told to expect major delays on the Bay Bridge starting next week as a deck rehabilitation project gets underway. The Maryland Department of Transportation says in a news release that two-way operations on the westbound span will cease Tuesday in preparation for the Maryland Transportation Authority’s $27 million deck rehabilitation project. The authority had scheduled the work to begin earlier this month, but Gov. Larry Hogan worked with the contractor to maintain three westbound lanes for commuters and beachgoers through the last weekend of the month. That will help travelers attending events including this weekend’s Sunfest celebration in Ocean City. It’s expected to reopen in time for the 2020 summer travel season.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The number of prison inmates in the state placed in solitary confinement remains “staggeringly high,” according to a prisoners’ rights advocate, despite an overall drop in the number of people behind bars. The Boston Globe reports at least 2,100 prisoners were placed in isolation one or more times last year, according to biannual reports from the Massachusetts Department of Correction. Inmates in isolation, which the department calls “restrictive housing,” are allowed outside their cell one hour a day, five days a week. James Pingeon, a staff attorney with Prisoners’ Legal Services, called the number “staggeringly high” and said many people are placed in solitary for minor infractions. Prisons officials said last year’s figures do not reflect the changes they’ve made to isolation policies since criminal justice overhaul was signed into law in April 2018.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinac Island:Could it be a fear of horses? Buzz is rampant on the island that Vice President Mike Pence plans to break with a century-old tradition barring motorized vehicles and ride to the Grand Hotel aboard a Chevrolet Suburban SUV on Saturday. Pence is a scheduled speaker at this weekend’s Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, held every other year on the island. He is the first sitting vice president to speak at the conference, first held in 1953. Gerald Ford, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have all gone to Mackinac, mostly before or after their time in the White House, and they all got around by horse-drawn carriage. Pence’s purported break with precedent for island visitors comes just days after he reportedly told House Republicans that last year Triple Crown winner American Pharaoh bit him so hard on the arm that he “almost collapsed.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Court of Appeals has handed environmental groups a victory by suspending two key permits for a planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine ahead of a hearing next month. The appeals court put PolyMet’s dam safety permit and its permit to mine on hold, ruling Wednesday that the Department of Natural Resources failed to adequately consider two important developments that happened after the agency issued the permits in November 2018. One was the massive failure of a tailings basin dam at an iron mine in Brazil in January that was somewhat similar to the dam PolyMet plans to build near Hoyt Lakes, in the Iron Range about 190 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The other is the acquisition of a majority stake in PolyMet by the Swiss commodities giant Glencore in June, Minnesota Public Radio reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s alligator program coordinator says great weather, high water and increasing expertise made for a good alligator season in public waters. Ricky Flynt of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks says hunters took 918 alligators from public waters this year. That’s 153 more than last year. The state record of 982 was set in 2015, when 997 hunters and guests went out, and nearly 70% of the groups harvested at least one alligator. With 816 permit holders and their guests participating this year, about 75% of the groups brought in at least one alligator. Paul Edwards of Okolona and five guests tied a state record by catching a 10-foot-long female. The 10-day public harvest ended Sept. 9. The private lands season runs until 6 a.m. Monday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Longtime University of Missouri professor Michael Budds has donated $4 million for a music studies center at the university. The university announced Wednesday that his donation will be used to create the Budds Center for American Music Studies. Budds taught music at the university for nearly four decades until retiring as a full-time faculty member this year. He teaches one class per semester. Budds was inducted into the Missouri Music Hall of Fame in 2014. The Columbia Missourian reports Budds is the last surviving member of his immediate family and said the center is a way to memorialize his parents and siblings. The center in the Fine Arts Building in the music school will promote American music through research and performance and will collect music memorabilia and academic material for research.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Park Service officials say motorized electric bicycles are now allowed in Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Glacier national parks, along with Wyoming’s National Elk Refuge. The joint announcement Thursday follows an order signed late last month by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt allowing the pedal bicycles with electric motors wherever traditional bikes can go in national parks. The guidelines posted on the Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton websites say e-bikes and traditional bicycles are barred from boardwalks, snow routes and nearly all backcountry trails. E-bikes can reach speeds of 28 mph or higher. Outdoor and conservation groups have objected to allowing them in parks without additional study or public notice.\n\nNebraska\n\nAtkinson: A boy with brain cancer who scored a touchdown at a Nebraska practice game is playing football for real. Thirteen-year-old Jack Hoffman took the field Monday to play center for his junior high team in Atkinson, located 179 miles northwest of Omaha. Hoffman underwent chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer in 2011. In 2013, he drew national attention when he ran for a player-assisted, 69-yard touchdown in the Huskers’ spring game. Andy Hoffman says his son relapsed in 2014 and participated in a clinical trial that helped. The tumor worsened in 2018, so now Jack is back in a clinical trial. Jack wanted to play football, so his parents checked with doctors, who said it was their decision. The Hoffmans finally left it up to the eighth grader.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Mayor Hillary Schieve has announced an ambitious plan to jump-start the construction of 1,000 homes in 120 days. Schieve said Wednesday that the pilot program would help combat the city’s housing crisis by deferring fees the city charges for such things as sewer hookups and road infrastructure until the back end of the project. The deferrals would be provided as loans worth $8,400 per unit to be repaid under a predetermined agreement with the city. Eligible developers must have already completed construction of at least one multifamily housing project worth at least $10 million. They also must plan to build a minimum of 30 townhouses, apartments or condominiums in designated “opportunity zones” and begin construction within 18 months of execution of the city agreement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Medical marijuana patients in the state soon will be able to get prescriptions even if they haven’t had the same doctor for three months. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a bill to eliminate the waiting period last month, but both the House and Senate voted Thursday to override his veto. In his veto message, Sununu said current law allows patients to obtain appropriate treatment while preserving responsible prescribing. But lawmakers who support the bill argued that it was unfair to make patients wait three months when no such rules apply to far more dangerous drugs, including opioids.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The city is announcing a partnership with ride-hailing service Via to offer on-demand bus service. Mayor Steven Fulop says it’s a response to unreliable service by New Jersey Transit, adding that it’s the first partnership of its kind in New Jersey. Riders will be able to request a bus from their smartphone and be picked up at a nearby “virtual” bus stop. Service will run Monday through Friday and cost $2 per ride, with discounts for senior citizens and low-income residents. NJ Transit currently operates 20 bus routes in Jersey City as well as light rail service. A spokeswoman said Thursday that the agency has expanded bus service in Jersey City in recent years to meet increasing demand.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state would eliminate tuition and fees for in-state undergraduate and community college students of all ages under a proposal from Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that requires legislative approval. The “opportunity scholarship” would tap the state general fund to cover costs not already paid for by federal scholarships and local lottery proceeds, a so-called last-dollar approach used by a handful of states that offer more limited free tuition. “By making college significantly more accessible to New Mexicans of every income, of every background, of every age, we are putting students first,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “We are creating meaningful opportunity for all.” Free tuition would be available at continuing education programs for older students who return to school but not for graduate studies such as medical or law school.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: There’s a new push to ban those tiny bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel from hotel rooms across the state. State Sen. Todd Kaminsky announced his legislative proposal Wednesday, calling single-use toiletry bottles a big source of plastic waste. The Long Island Democrat cited estimates that hotels in New York City alone dispose of an estimated 27 million plastic toiletry bottles annually. If the ban were enacted, hotels could instead use wall-mounted dispensers or packaging made from non-plastic materials. The idea is gaining support in the industry, with the Hotel Association of New York City and the state Hospitality and Tourism Association both backing Kaminsky’s idea. Last month Marriott International, the world’s largest hotel chain, announced plans to eliminate small plastic toiletry bottles worldwide by December 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The Trump administration is threatening to cut a grant for a Middle East studies program run by the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The administration says the program misuses federal funds to advance “ideological priorities” and unfairly promotes “the positive aspects of Islam” but not Christianity or Judaism. A recent letter from the Education Department orders the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies to revise its offerings by Sunday or risk losing funding from the National Resource Center program. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered an investigation following complaints that the consortium hosted a taxpayer-funded conference with an anti-Israeli bias. The department objects to some of the consortium’s offerings and says it has a “lack of balance” in its teachings on religion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Department of Health says more people in the state are using child car seats correctly. Data compiled by health officials shows 72% of those with car seats were using them improperly in 2018. That figure is actually an improvement and compares with 86% in 2009. In the past five years in North Dakota, 8 children have died and 1,037 youngsters 12 and younger were injured in motor vehicle crashes. The health department recommends keeping children in rear-facing car seats for as long as possible. Once a child outgrows the rear-facing seats, a forward-facing car seat with a harness should be used. And, after outgrowing the forward-facing seat, children should be placed in a booster seat until they are the right size to use just a seat belt.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: On the eve of the city’s boisterous annual Oktoberfest celebration, hundreds of people, some covered in fake blood, and first responders rehearsed for the worst – a terror attack in the riverside entertainment area. The morning-long exercise Thursday at The Banks area and at Great American Ball Park, where the Cincinnati Reds play, used a scenario of a large truck carrying chemicals and crashing into a crowd. Regional emergency management agencies, first responders and hospitals took part in the large-scale exercise. West Clermont High School students applied moulage to casualty actors from area colleges. The Oktoberfest Zinzinnati is expected to draw about half a million people this weekend. A kick-off event, the “running of the wieners” dachshund race), was set for a couple of hours after the mass casualty training.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Department of Corrections officials said Wednesday that numerous weapons, cellphones and drugs have been found by investigators following a series of apparently coordinated fights at six state prisons that left one inmate dead, dozens injured and prisons statewide locked down. “A lot of shanks … broken broom handles, broken faucets, faucet heads that have a cord attached to them,” according to department spokesman Matt Elliott. “The types of weapons inmates typically use and fight with.” Bobby Cleveland, director of the Oklahoma Corrections Professionals, an association for prison employees, said the fights had “to be a coordinated effort,” noting they included minimum security lock-ups. Cleveland said inmates can use contraband cellphones to coordinate attacks among prisoners at other facilities.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Newly released scores from this spring show the state’s schools have recorded their poorest performance in the five-year history of Oregon’s current reading, writing and math tests. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the scores released Thursday indicate only 40% of students across grades three through eight have mastered math, and just over half can read and write proficiently. So many high school students sat out the nationally benchmarked tests, known as Smarter Balanced exams, that their results, which were down sharply in reading and writing, are not reliable. State schools chief Colt Gill cautioned against reading too much into the test results, noting that an in-depth end-of-year test on reading, writing and math doesn’t capture the breadth of subjects that students should learn in a well-rounded curriculum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The shutdown of Three Mile Island, site of the United States’ worst commercial nuclear power accident, is imminent. Exelon Corp. officials said the plant will stop producing electricity around noon Friday, following through on a decision the Chicago-based energy giant made in May after it became clear that it would not get a financial rescue from Pennsylvania. Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 opened in 1974 and is licensed to operate through 2034. But Exelon has complained that the plant is losing money in competitive electricity markets. Three Mile Island also faces particularly difficult economics because the 1979 accident left it with just one reactor. Decommissioning it could take decades. No nuclear plant that was proposed after the accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the United States.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: A study from Bryant University shows businesses at the massive Quonset Business Park have pumped $4.3 billion into Rhode Island’s economy. The economic assessment also showed the more than 200 companies located inside the former Navy base are responsible for 17% of the manufacturing jobs in the state. About 12,000 people are employed at the business park, with 6,800 directly involved in manufacturing. The Bryant study, which was commissioned and funded by the Quonset Development Corporation, showed the average wage of an employee at Quonset is $59,235, well above the state’s average of $49,795. The study found those wages created nearly $1.3 billion in income for Rhode Island households in 2018.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials say a growing drought is threatening to devastate farmers, and they worry dry conditions will spread. A special committee that reviews drought voted Wednesday to place 31 of South Carolina’s 46 counties into a moderate drought – the second in four worsening stages. The vote came after the Drought Response Committee had a long discussion on whether to advance some counties to severe drought based on crop damage. Chris Toole says it has barely rained in two months at his farm in Orangeburg County, and he expects to lose half his corn, cotton and peanuts. Officials say water levels in streams and reservoirs are still OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nChamberlain: Fees to enter and use the state’s parks may be increasing. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission is seeking comments from the public about proposed increases to state park and camping fees as the park system faces $8 million in flood damage, which includes tree damage, shorted electrical pedestals, and washed-out roads and campsites, according to GFP. The increase in fees would provide about $3 million in additional revenue. GFP is proposing to increase the daily park entrance fee from $6 to $8 and the annual park entrance pass from $30 to $36. The commission is expected to vote on the increase during its meeting Oct. 3-4 in Chamberlain. Comments can be submitted at least 72 hours prior to the meeting online.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee will set up a livestream at a rock that’s often painted by students to promote events but was recently marred by an anti-Semitic message. Knoxville campus Chancellor Donde Plowman wrote Wednesday that the livestream feed will be made available for anyone to see, showing that the university community is taking collective responsibility for the Rock. Plowman wrote that university police have increased patrols at the campus landmark, adding that they believe the people responsible for the hate speech written there are not students or members of the campus community. Plowman wrote that the university has revised its campus space rental policy to restrict rentals to unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, a new group, programs and special lectures are in the works to further awareness.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The FBI is offering a reward to help identify suspects in arson fires at three Catholic churches in the area. Authorities say St. Matthew Catholic Church, St. Patrick Cathedral and St. Jude Catholic Church were targeted with incendiary devices in an attempt to start fires at the churches in May and June. The churches were damaged, but no one was injured. The FBI said Thursday that it’s offering a $5,000 reward in the case. The churches serve a primarily Hispanic community still reeling from a mass shooting targeting Latinos in which 22 people were killed at an El Paso Walmart last month.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Police used their vehicle sirens to drive a 2-year-old bear up a tree after its presence in a northern Utah town caused traffic delays Wednesday morning. State Division of Wildlife Resources spokeswoman Faith Heaton Jolley said division personnel then were able to tranquilize the bear and catch it in a large net when it fell out of the tree. Jolley said the brown-colored black bear was placed in a trap in the bed of a pickup truck and driven to the Wasatch Mountains, where it was released. Pictures show him jumping out of the truck and running away. Jolley says it is unusual for a bear to be roaming city streets that are several miles away from mountains east of the city where wildlife biologists think it came from.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The first two of what will become 20 F-35 fighter aircrafts arrived Thursday at the Vermont Air National Guard, the first guard unit to receive the next-generation fighter. The aircraft will be based at the Burlington International Airport. The delivery follows years of hard work and planning. “The F-35 coming into Burlington really secures our mission and our future,” says Col. David Smith, the commander of the 158th Fighter Wing that is the new home to the F-35s. But for some members of the community, the arrival of noisier aircraft marks the failure of years long efforts to keep the Air Force from delivering the planes to an airport located among residential neighborhoods in the middle of Vermont’s most populous county.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy announced plans Thursday to seek approval to build what it says would be the largest offshore wind project in the United States off the Virginia coast. The company says the project would include about 220 wind turbines in federal waters it has already leased 27 miles off Virginia Beach. If approved as proposed, Dominion says the approximately $7.8 billion project could produce more than 2,600 megawatts of energy during peak wind by 2026, enough to power 650,000 homes. “This is, to us, big news. It’s a big step for us to accomplish our carbon reduction goals,” says Mark Mitchell, vice president of generation construction for Richmond-based Dominion. The project has been years in the making. Dominion already has an offshore wind pilot project underway, which state regulators approved last year despite their concerns about its cost.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: U.S. protections for the waters that a group of endangered orcas call home could soon expand beyond the Seattle area to encompass much of the West Coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a proposal Wednesday to increase the critical habitat designation for southern resident killer whales by more than sevenfold under the Endangered Species Act. Just 73 orcas remain in the Pacific Northwest population, the lowest number in more than three decades. The latest proposal calls for an additional 15,626 square miles of federally protected habitat that would run from the border with Canada down south to Point Sur, California.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBuckhannon: A federal biologist says federally protected vultures are invading the state, having migrated from Central and South America about 45 years ago and now settling up the East Coast. Thomas Elliott is a wildlife biologist and district supervisor with the wildlife services program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Inter-Mountain quotes him as saying the birds first appeared in eastern West Virginia about 15 years ago and have spread across the state. Black vultures are predatory creatures with some scavenging tendencies. Elliott says the birds kill livestock and pets and destroy people’s property, even ripping rubber off tires. He says the vultures have no true predator.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s schools chief says a nearly $600 million boost in education funding is a “down payment” on equity and closing the state’s persistent achievement gap. State Superintendent Carolyn Stanford Taylor calls that gap a “crisis.” She delivered the message Thursday during her first state of education address at the Capitol. Taylor took over as state superintendent after her predecessor, Tony Evers, was elected governor. The speech comes a week after standardized test scores showed that less than half of Wisconsin students are proficient in math and English. The scores also showed a continuing achievement gap. Stanford Taylor says progress is being made to address “deep, persistent gaps in achievement, access and opportunity.” Democrats say the poor test results showed the need to increase funding for K-12 schools, while Republicans say they showed that the status quo was not working.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: Lawmakers have voted to advance a bill raising the state minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 years. The Casper Star-Tribune reports that lawmakers aim to limit minors’ access to tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, chewable tobacco and nicotine-infused vapor products. Officials say the bill was one of several being considered by lawmakers Wednesday, but it also requires approval of the full Legislature. State lawmakers say currently people age 18 and older are allowed to purchase tobacco products. Officials say 18 states have risen their minimum smoking age to 21 with some exemptions for military members. Officials say enforcing existing laws and a higher purchase age could be effective at discouraging young people from purchasing products illegally. Officials say 95% of smokers start before the age of 21.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/27/subway-thanksgiving-high-horse-gift-wrap-wars-news-around-states/40714889/", "title": "A subway Thanksgiving, too-high horse: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A new statue of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks will be unveiled at Court Square downtown Sunday at 1 p.m. The unveiling Dec. 1 will coincide with the day in 1955 when Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a white man. Along with the Parks memorial, the city will present two historic markers for Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses unconstitutional. The civil rights memorials are a partnership among the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency will decide by September how much ocean and coast will be designated as critical habitat for two ice seal species found in the state. The Center for Biological Diversity announced Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Commerce Department for the Trump administration to issue a critical habitat rule for ringed and bearded seals. Ringed and bearded seals live off Alaska’s northwest coast. Both are listed as threatened. Designation of critical habitat for threatened species is required by the Endangered Species Act a year after a listing. The Center for Biological Diversity sued in June because no critical habitat has been designated. Federal agencies that authorize activities such as oil drilling within critical habitat must consult with wildlife managers to determine if threatened species will be affected.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: For many elementary students, this time of year is filled with lessons about Thanksgiving, often arts and crafts or plays about the Pilgrims. That’s not the case for students at schools like Salt River Elementary and Puente de Hozho. Instead, these students get lessons that give insight into and strengthen their identity as indigenous people, focusing on fall harvest traditions and the importance of giving thanks. Teaching the myth of Thanksgiving is not required in the state’s standards for history and social studies. Salt River Elementary is a Bureau of Indian Education school located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and 100% of the student body is Native American. The school incorporates cultural and traditional learning within its curriculum. During November, many teachers increase those lessons for Native American Heritage Month. As for Thanksgiving, “we only talk about being thankful and being with family,” says Clarice Garcia, a fifth grade teacher. In the weeks leading up to the holiday, Garcia said she tries to talk about the positive and negative impacts explorers had on indigenous people, letting students form their own opinion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas is now the home of a photo archive containing nearly a million photos of historical figures and events. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the collection arrived at the campus in Fayetteville last month. The archive includes photos of Babe Ruth, Bonnie Parker, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King. There are also pictures documenting politics, wars, natural disasters and the civil rights movement. Dean of libraries Dennis T. Clark says the large trove is very significant in American journalism. He says it is the New York Post’s photo archive, which contains photos dating back to the 1860s. Lori Birrell, head of the special collections department at the UA library, says the collection will show the university is interested in having a national and international presence. Clark says the gift came from an anonymous donor in 2017.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has a pair of quirky new arrivals from Australia: platypuses. Last week the zoo publicly debuted an 8-year-old male named Birrarung and a 15-year-old female named Eve. The pair were flown to the park late last month. The zoo says it’s the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses – egg-laying mammals with furry bodies and ducklike bills – have been cared for outside of Australia. Safari Park’s lead keeper, Lori Hieber, says the pair have settled into their new, specially built habitat. She says they swim in the pools, play in the waterfalls and hunt live crayfish. An international conservation group lists the platypus as a “near threatened” species, mainly from habitat loss and the potential destruction from climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court has denied a request to reconsider a ruling declaring the sentences of hundreds of criminal defendants to be illegal. The Denver Post reports the justices refused to rethink whether criminal offenders could be sentenced to both prison and probation in the same case. Officials say the court ruled in September that defendants couldn’t be simultaneously sentenced. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a petition this month challenging the decision, saying it could create extensive litigation affecting hundreds or even thousands of plea agreements and leading to numerous challenges. Officials say defendants convicted by a jury must be resentenced. Authorities say witnesses might have moved away, police investigators might have retired, and victims might not want to testify again, causing problems in the process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state will soon host its second inauguration of 2019. On Monday, West Hartford fifth grader Myra Stanfield will become the 2020 Kid Governor, succeeding 2019’s Ella Briggs. A ceremony is planned at the Old State House in Hartford. Like Ella, Myra was elected to the one-year position by fifth graders across Connecticut. She ran on a platform of preventing animal abuse. Her term begins in January. The civics education program was created in 2015 by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, now known as the Connecticut Democracy Center. Participating students are given an opportunity to create a campaign platform around an issue, run for office and vote in the election. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose inauguration was 11 months ago, released a video online congratulating Myra.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Department of Insurance is warning residents about a new Medicare tool that state officials say causes confusion and conceals the total cost of coverage. In what he described as a rare consumer alert, Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said in a press release that the department has received numerous complaints about Medicare’s Prescription Plan Finder. The tool, created by the federal government and used by millions, is supposed to help find and compare Medicare coverage options for the current enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Navarro said the tool’s “focus on premium costs can deflect focus from higher personal costs at the pharmacy counter.” The tool organizes responses, Navarro said, by showing lowest premium costs first. But previous versions of the tool showed it by total annual costs. And if residents enter multiple medications, they could receive search results for plans that don’t cover all those they entered, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is joining several states in suing e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, saying the company’s online ads and promotions illegally targeted minors. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging that Juul’s viral marketing contributed to the surge in underage vaping by teens in the district and across the U.S. The move follows similar lawsuits filed by California, New York and North Carolina. Several other states are also investigating Juul, which dominates the U.S. vaping market. Under intense pressure, Juul has suspended its U.S. advertising and halted sales of all but two of its flavors. Additionally, the company closed its social media accounts and tightened age verification for online sales. Representatives for Juul did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: The local school district is bringing in a crack squad of four-legged experts to deal with an overgrown patch of rough terrain, where hidden gopher tortoises, snakes, steep banks and vertical drop-offs make it too hazardous for grounds crews to handle. About two dozen goats will descend into a fenced area around a pond next to Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville next week. Grounds services supervisor Matt Nolle says the area is too dangerous for heavy equipment or even people on foot. Goats are better for the environment and can get into places humans can’t. “Somehow, four legs is an advantage,” Nolle says. The Brevard School District is paying about $4,500 to hire the goats from Rent-a-Ruminant, a landscaping livestock company.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia Southern University has officially opened a learning center in Ireland. Savannah Morning News reports university leaders traveled to Wexford last week for the ceremonial event. A news release from the university says the center stems from a longtime partnership between the town and Savannah, as well as Georgia Southern’s Center for Irish Research and Teaching. The school says many Savannah residents claim Irish ancestry and can trace ancestors specifically to Wexford. University President Kyle Marrero met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins during the visit. The school says it marked the first official meeting between a Georgia Southern president and a foreign head of state. The school says Georgia Southern is the first public university in the United States to open an outreach learning facility in Ireland.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Education plans to offer free Hawaiian language courses to its employees. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the department’s 22,000 salaried employees, including 13,000 teachers, will be able to take courses beginning in January. Officials say the program is a partnership between the education department’s Office of Hawaiian Education and the University of Hawaii’s community colleges. The education department has incorporated Hawaiian language, culture and history in its curriculum since an 80-year public education ban on the language was overturned at the 1978 state constitutional convention. Employees can enroll in scheduled courses at seven community colleges beginning in the spring semester or join customized courses for education department staff groups. Teachers completing courses will receive professional development credits, while other employees will be given college credit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Fisheries managers are optimistic a program to save imperiled Snake River sockeye salmon is heading in the right direction despite few of the ocean-going fish making it back to central Idaho this year. Of the 735,000 young sockeye released in the state in 2017, only 17 survived the 900-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean and then back again to arrive as adults in the Sawtooth Basin near Stanley. But John Powell of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said last week that fish raised to adults in hatcheries will keep the population going. Biologists also released 610 adults this fall into central Idaho lakes to spawn naturally. Powell also says biologists have solved problems that caused most of the young hatchery sockeye to die shortly after being released into the wild in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: There are full slates of special events and celebrations scheduled for the holiday season at two state historic sites in the city. Santa will be available regularly at the Old State Capitol to collect children’s Christmas wishes, and specially themed tours are scheduled for the Dana-Thomas House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Children and families may visit with St. Nick and play holiday games at the Old State Capitol from 1 to 5 p.m. each Saturday from Nov. 30 to Dec. 21 and from 5 to 8 p.m. each Wednesday from Dec. 4 to 18. Each day will feature a different musical group as well. A dozen variously themed tours of the Dana-Thomas House are scheduled periodically from Nov. 29 through Dec. 20. Some require reservations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is facing calls from Democrats to explain his role in Amazon being cleared of responsibility for a warehouse worker’s death despite initial findings of major safety violations. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb denies any involvement in the state’s investigation of the 2017 death at Amazon’s Plainfield warehouse. The news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting reports a safety inspector ordered a $28,000 fine against Amazon, concluding it didn’t provide enough training before a forklift fatally crushed 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry. It cites a recording the inspector made in which his boss tells Amazon officials how to shift the blame to “employee misconduct.” The death investigation happened while the Holcomb administration was bidding on Amazon’s planned second headquarters project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has pardoned two tom turkeys, continuing a long-standing Thanksgiving tradition celebrating the state’s turkey industry. The male birds named Benjamin and Franklin will live at Living History Farms in Urbandale, a 500-acre, open-air history museum that demonstrates three centuries of Iowa farm life. Reynolds held the annual event Tuesday at Terrace Hill, the governor’s residence, where she says she’ll spend Thanksgiving cooking for her family. Several family members, including grandchildren, petted the turkeys after Reynolds read the proclamation freeing them from becoming a thanksgiving meal. Iowa ranks seventh in U.S. turkey production, turning out more than 12 million turkeys annually on 130 farms. The state is fifth in turkey processing with plants in Storm Lake and West Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly reveled in holiday spirit Tuesday for the annual horse-drawn delivery of a Christmas tree to Cedar Crest, the official governor’s residence. The first-year governor said for years she has watched the celebration on the news with the rest of the state, and it was a “treat” to preside over the event. Every year, a member of the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association donates a tree for the occasion. Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm near Lawrence donated this year’s model. Robin Dunn, of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville, guided percherons Bill and Bruce as they pulled a replica Wells Fargo stagecoach up the drive to the front of the governor’s mansion to deliver the tree. Dunn said she has now delivered trees to five Kansas governors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s politicos are getting all wrapped up in the Christmas wars this year. After the reelection campaign for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., began selling gift wrap featuring the Senate majority leader’s face with a Santa hat and a green bow tie – reminiscent of an iconic image of Christmas crooner Bing Crosby – the Kentucky Democratic Party has shot back with its own bespoke present paper. A donation of $30 to the commonwealth’s blue party yields a roll of red “Moscow Mitch” wrapping paper, featuring yellow images of the Republican wearing a Cossack hat with the “hammer and sickle” symbol on top of the words “Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch,” referring to a nickname McConnell received over the summer. “Anything @Team_Mitch can do, we can do better,” the Kentucky Democratic Party wrote in a tweet.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state museum system is asking for feedback as it works to update its governance, operations and attendance at its properties. The museum system wants people to fill out a five- to 10-minute survey about their interest in the facilities and their experiences at them. The survey will be available online until Saturday. The Louisiana state museum system includes the Cabildo and the Presbytere in New Orleans, the New Orleans Jazz Museum, the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, among other facilities. Survey participants can enter to win a membership through the Friends of the Cabildo that gives free admission for two people and any children to all public state museum properties.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: Officials say a new partnership with the state’s farmers markets has expanded the number of people who can use the markets by making food assistance easier to access. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it has partnered with the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets to help pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program processing equipment. The technology can cost hundreds of dollars, which prices many small markets out of the ability to buy it. About 1 in 8 Maine residents uses SNAP. The state says a half-dozen farmers markets have received new SNAP processing gear through the partnership since July. Maine has a total of about 35 farmers markets that accept SNAP.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore: The National Park Service will institute a modest increase for all parks that charge entrance fees next year, including on Assateague Island. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, entrance fees at Assateague Island National Seashore will be modified to align with standardized rates being implemented nationwide for similar national park areas at the rate of an extra $5 per category. A seven-day pass to the park will be $25 per vehicle or $20 per motorcycle. An annual park pass will cost $45, and individuals will be charged $15 per person when entering by commercial vehicle. An entrance pass provides seven consecutive days of access to the seashore and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. The additional funds will be used for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Native Americans are gathering for a 50th year in the seaside town where the Pilgrims settled – not to give thanks but to grieve. United American Indians of New England held its first National Day of Mourning in 1970. Since then, tribes have assembled at noon every Thanksgiving Day on a windswept hill overlooking Plymouth Rock. On Thursday, they’ll recall what organizers describe as “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture.” That’s an in-your-feast message, but co-leader Mahtowin Munro says the group is determined to get Americans to look beyond the Thanksgiving myth of European settlers and native people coexisting peacefully. Next year, Plymouth marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: Leaders with Flint Community Schools are considering closing four of the district’s 12 school buildings amid a $5.7 million budget deficit partly driven by rising special education costs not covered by the state. Superintendent Derrick Lopez presented the proposal at a special school board meeting last week. It also calls for the restructuring four other district buildings. The plan would decrease transportation, security, maintenance, administrative and other expenses. Lopez says the district’s special education student number has greatly risen from just under 15% in the 2014-15 school year, as Flint’s water crisis began, to now 24%. Flint’s water was lead-contaminated when officials used corrosive river water from April 2014 to October 2015. In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, ability to focus and academic achievement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have warned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that a proposal to streamline water quality laws would cripple their authority to protect drinking water, streams and wildlife from dozens of new projects each year. The EPA’s proposal targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states to set their own conditions, conduct reviews, and approve or deny projects that could potentially pollute waterways. The change would give federal authorities power to dismiss conditions set by states or tribes and allow the EPA to overrule a state’s project denial. It would also prevent states from studying indirect sources of water pollution. But the Star Tribune reports that a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce official says some businesses welcome the changes. The EPA says states use their authority to impose conditions not related to water quality.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Magnolia State residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore. Tickets went on sale Monday at roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites. The Mississippi Lottery Corporation says people bought a total of $2.5 million in lottery tickets on the first day of sales, which translates into $570,000 for the state. Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson has been pushing for years to bring a lottery to Mississippi. She bought a ceremonial first ticket at a RaceWay store and gas station in south Jackson. “It feels great. Finally, it becomes a reality. And it just goes to show you what happens if you don’t give up,” Clarke said. For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery amid strong opposition from politically powerful churches. People often drove to neighboring states such as Louisiana to buy tickets there.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Comedian Heidi Gardner is flipping the switch on an annual holiday lighting ceremony at the upscale Country Club Plaza shopping and dining district. The “Saturday Night Light” cast member says getting the starring role at the Thanksgiving night event once seemed “crazy” and “out of reach.” The Kansas City native was working on the Plaza in 1998 when actor Paul Rudd did the honors, lighting up several blocks of buildings. And she told The Kansas City Star that she has long had a picture of the Plaza lights on her refrigerator. The ceremony dates back to the 1930s. The only time the Plaza lights were not in operation occurred in 1973, when President Richard Nixon called upon all Americans to curtail the use of Christmas lights to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Board of Regents has approved a $150,000 pay raise to retain Waded Cruzado as the president of Montana State University after she received an offer for a higher-paying job. Supporters say Cruzado’s vision and fundraising ability make her worth the $476,000 annual salary, while opponents note her raise is nearly three times the median household income in the state. Commissioner of Higher Education Clay Christian supported the raise, saying it would allow Cruzado to continue the momentum she has created on the Bozeman campus. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports two classified MSU employees noted some workers are paid less than $11 an hour, vacancies are hard to fill, and people have left because they can’t afford to live in Bozeman. Regents on Friday also approved a 2% or 50-cent-per-hour raise for university system employees, whichever is greater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is temporarily lifting weight restrictions on trucks carrying propane to address a shortage of heating fuels. State officials have suspended the 90,000-pound gross weight limit for motor carriers hauling critically needed heating fuels through Dec. 15. Lt. Gov. Mike Foley issued the order last week on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the state. Officials say drivers exceeding the normal weight limits must carry a copy of the executive order to document that they are providing direct support to the state. The order doesn’t apply to the interstate system. State officials say the shortage isn’t serious, but they’re monitoring it. They say more extreme shortages in surrounding states have increased the need to transport through Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A multibillion-dollar megaresort taking shape on the north end of the Strip is on track to become the most expensive hotel-casino project ever built. Malaysia-based Genting Group says the company’s Resorts World Las Vegas is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The cost of the project, initially targeted for a 2016 opening on the former site of the Stardust, was last estimated at $4 billion. Now it sits at $4.3 billion. That would make Resorts World Las Vegas more expensive than the development of the $4 billion Cosmopolitan. With the inflated price tag comes new features, according to the company, including a 5,000-capacity “state-of-the-art theater” scalable to host A-list residencies and corporate events; a 75,000-square-foot “nightlife and daylife concept”; and a 50-foot-diameter video globe to display over 6,000 square feet of LED content.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: Gov. Chris Sununu’s advisory board has voted to eliminate tolls on one of the state’s heavily traveled highways. The Executive Council voted Monday to get rid of the Merrimack tolls at the Everett Turnpike. The highway links Massachusetts and the New Hampshire cities of Manchester and Concord. Drivers currently pay 50 cents on the on and off ramps at the exits. The tolls bring in more than $1 million each year, but a transportation commission has decided that it puts Merrimack residents under an unfair burden. The tollbooths that were built 30 years ago will remain, but starting Jan. 1, motorists will be allowed to drive through without paying a toll.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Officials are hoping the return of redesigned holiday decorations will keep the season bright for commuters who travel through the Holland Tunnel. A slightly larger Christmas tree than the one used last year will be placed to cover the letter “A,” and a wreath will cover the letter “O.” A menorah will be positioned adjacent to the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the tunnel. After complaints that the decades-old decorations over the New York-bound tunnel were distracting, more than 21,000 people last year voted in a poll commissioned by tunnel operator the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Voters wanted the tree moved from over the “N” in “Holland” to cover the “A” and the wreath moved from over the “U.” The decorations go up Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCimarron: One of the most spectacular properties owned by the Boy Scouts of America is being mortgaged to help secure the youth organization’s line of credit. The Boy Scouts say there is no plan to sell the Philmont Scout Ranch in Colfax County. It is being used as collateral to help meet financial needs that include rising insurance costs related to sex-abuse litigation. The move dismayed a member of Philmont’s oversight committee, who says it violates agreements made when the land was donated in 1938. The BSA disputed his assertion. The mortgage document was signed by top Boy Scout officials in March. But members of the Philmont Ranch Committee only recently learned of the development. The ranch is a popular destination for hiking and camping trips.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Thanksgiving came early for a group of New York City commuters who enjoyed a holiday feast on a subway train. Video footage shows riders standing behind a white-clothed table covered with plates of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread in the middle of a Brooklyn-bound L train on Sunday. Stand-up comedian Jodell “Joe Show” Lewis tells the New York Post he organized the Thanksgiving dinner to “bring a little excitement to commuters” and feed any New Yorkers who might be hungry. Lewis says he chose the L train after he saw how “dreary and upset” riders were at the inconvenience of a construction project that has cut service on the line.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Students and employees at all University of North Carolina system campuses will be able to use their school identification cards for the state’s voter ID mandate starting in 2020. The State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday the approval of cards for students and employees at 12 of the 17 UNC schools. These IDs were rejected earlier this year because they didn’t meet standards set in a law implementing the photo ID requirement. The ID mandate was added to the state constitution in 2018. The General Assembly altered ID security rules last spring so schools with rejected cards could apply again for next year. The board says more than 150 types of photo ID are approved for use with the March primary. A driver’s license is the most common.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There will be a runoff election for a new state Supreme Court chief justice. None of the three justices running to lead the high court received the majority votes necessary on Monday to clinch the position. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jon Jensen were the top vote-getters, followed by Daniel Crothers. McEvers and Jensen are still in the running. The ballots were cast by the state’s 52 district court judges and each of the five justices on the high court. They will now recast their votes, to be tallied in early December. The chief justice position was left open after 86-year-old Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle announced in September that he would not seek reappointment to the top post when his term expires at the end of the year.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city’s zoo has welcomed a new baby giraffe shortly after losing the 12-year-old male giraffe that sired him. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden says 8-year-old Cece delivered the calf Saturday, and mom and baby are doing fine. Zoo officials say it’s too soon to determine the sex of the 6-foot-tall calf. The calf was the seventh sired by Kimba, who died earlier this month from complications following a surgical procedure on his hooves. The calf is the 17th giraffe born at the zoo. Giraffe populations in the wild are being affected by habitat loss, trophy hunting and illegal poaching, Zoo officials say up to 75% of calves in the wild die in their first few months of life, mainly due to predators.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new study has found that nearly 500 older, low-income Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The Oklahoman reports that a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis estimates 476 state residents between the ages of 55 and 64 died prematurely from 2014 to 2017 because the state declined to expand eligibility for the federal health care program. The left-leaning think tank says they are among 15,600 such deaths that could have been avoided nationally if all states had expanded Medicaid. The Washington, D.C.-based group says its estimates are based on mortality data and records and data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Republican leaders in the state dismissed the study as irresponsible and reckless.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians are being called to take pictures of the coast this week, for science. Coastwatch volunteer coordinator Jesse Jones says photos of extra high tides happening through Thursday can help scientists learn how different communities will be affected by climate change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports photographs taken by citizen scientists and assembled by the Oregon King Tides Project can show where the water might be when the oceans rise. The Oregon King Tides project wants pictures from all along the coast to help figure out how to plan for rising seas. In particular, they need photographs of beaches as well as familiar landmarks like jetties, bridges, buildings, roads, seawall, shorelines, beach infrastructure and estuaries. Jones notes that the most helpful beach pictures are taken facing north or south so that it’s clear how far in or out the tide has come. Participants can upload the images to the Oregon King Tides website or post them to social media with the hashtags #orkingtides and #kingtides.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: The state overhauled its child sexual abuse laws Tuesday, more than a year after a grand jury report showed the cover-up of hundreds of cases of abuse in most of Pennsylvania’s Roman Catholic dioceses over the past seven decades. The central bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf gives future victims of child sex abuse more time to file lawsuits and ends time limits for police to file criminal charges. The grand jury report spurred several states to change their laws and other states to begin similar investigations. Wolf said the new laws will help repair “faults in our justice system that prevent frightened, abused children from seeking justice when they grow into courageous adults.” Wolf signed the bills at Muhlenberg High School in Reading, the home district of Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi, a champion of the legislation who has spoken publicly about being raped as a 13-year-old by a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city is working with Brown University to create a digital map of one of the nation’s largest and most intact Colonial-era African burial grounds. The city wants a high-resolution map of God’s Little Acre to serve as the foundation for future site management and exploration. Doctoral students from the Ivy League university are working on the project. The Preservation Society of Newport County says the burial ground contains about 200 professionally carved headstones for enslaved and freed Africans from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when African graves were typically left unmarked in the United States. City officials hope the map will be ready next summer so it can be made available to the public through a smartphone app and online. Tours currently rely on a printed map.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLoris: A farm animal with unbridled ambition has given new meaning to the phrase “get off your high horse.” Horry County Fire Rescue workers say they were called Sunday to a barn in Loris, where a horse somehow managed to leave its stall and climb into a hayloft. They had to bring in heavy equipment, and large-animal veterinarians helped sedate the horse before it was lowered to the ground on a makeshift platform. The horse has moved on to greener pastures, seemingly in good spirits in a grazing field. Rescue workers still haven’t figured out how the horse managed to climb a narrow set of stairs into the loft.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The last living worker who helped construct Mount Rushmore National Memorial has died. Donald “Nick” Clifford of Keystone, South Dakota, was 98. His wife, Carolyn Clifford, says he died Saturday at a hospice in Rapid City. At 17, Nick Clifford was the youngest worker hired to work at Mount Rushmore, in the state’s Black Hills. He operated a winch that carried workers up and down the mountain where the faces of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved, and he drilled holes for dynamite. The Rapid City Journal reports that Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln, decided in 1938 to field a baseball team and hired Clifford, who already was a veteran pitcher and right fielder. Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, earning 55 cents an hour.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal officials are proposing removing the Nashville crayfish from the endangered species list. A news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says a review has found the crayfish populations are “healthy, stable and robust.” The 7-inch crustacean lives only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville. The last review of the crayfish by the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended listing the species as “threatened.” Tierra Curry says that would be a better option. The senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity says Nashville is developing rapidly, and giving the species threatened status would allow it some continued protection. The proposal for delisting was published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments through Jan. 27.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An English teacher who was fired after tweeting that her high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark’s tweet was protected by the First Amendment. Clark can either receive back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year’s salary. District spokeswoman Barbara Griffith says Morath’s ruling was a technicality, and the district is exploring its options. Clark’s attorney didn’t respond for a comment. The district board voted in June to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump and that she didn’t realize her postings were public.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Two of the state’s small cities tested an alternative method of voting that allows people to rank candidates from first to last during recent municipal elections. The Daily Herald reports six cities had planned to test the ranked-choice voting system, but four backed out over concerns about how to explain how it works to voters. Vineyard and Payson were the municipalities that tried out a method that allows voters to rank candidates from first to last. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated. The process continues for several rounds until a candidate gets the majority of votes. Vineyard City Recorder Pamela Spencer says she only received a few calls from confused voters and considered it a success.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Four local high school journalists have won an award for their victory over censorship. Last year, the Burlington High students broke a story in their school newspaper about a school employee facing unprofessional conduct charges. The interim principal asked the students’ adviser to take it down. The article was removed, but students kept up links to it on social media, saying it was censored. Students talked to legal experts, and the newspaper cited its rights under the “New Voices” law that protects First Amendment rights of student journalists. Last week the students were awarded the Courage in Student Journalism Award, sponsored by the Student Press Law Center, the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University and the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials are reminding Virginians it’s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Department of Health encourages everyone older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying from influenza.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council is proceeding with a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides pitched by Mayor Jenny Durkan to help pay for affordable housing and the delayed downtown streetcar and to give new support to ride-hailing drivers. The Seattle Times reports council members unanimously approved the 57-cent tax Monday. Durkan and the council have also promised to ensure Uber and Lyft drivers make Seattle’s $16 minimum wage starting next summer, but the city first plans to study driver pay. The new tax stops short of a more widespread tolling scheme some say is necessary to truly address congestion choking downtown streets. Durkan’s administration has explored the concept of congestion pricing, in which all drivers downtown would pay a toll. Uber and Lyft back that type of widespread charge and decried the new tax, claiming it could stymie ridership and hurt drivers. Durkan’s office projects the new tax will raise about $25 million a year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It’s officially buck hunting season in the Mountain State. The annual buck firearms season kicked off this week and is expected to bring thousands of hunters to the state’s vast woodlands. Officials say starting the season toward the end of November increases the chances of hunting during snowfall, which makes it easier to spot and track deer. The season traditionally opens on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Hunters can harvest two deer on the same day, but only one can be an antlered buck. Anyone who wants an additional buck must buy a stamp from the state and have additional licensing. Gary Foster of the Division of Natural Resources says the state’s deer seasons help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state’s economy. Buck firearms season ends Dec. 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic lawmakers want more diaper-changing stations in the state. State Reps. Jonathan Brostoff and David Crowley and state Sen. Chris Larson have introduced a bill that would require public and commercial buildings built or renovated after the bill becomes law to have diaper-changing stations in every restroom. Owners of commercial buildings with public restrooms would have to post signs identifying bathrooms with changing stations. Brostoff says he’s a new father, and he’s constantly struck by how few businesses have changing stations and how many place them only in women’s restrooms. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about Republican support for the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The family of a man who was shot and killed by police officers is suing the city and the Casper Police Department. Daniel Wolosin alleges in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court that police officials failed to properly train officers in de-escalation techniques and failed to enforce policies that would have prevented the death of 38-year-old David Wolosin. Authorities say Wolosin opened fire first in the May 2018 shootout after two officers were called to check on a report of a man allowing children to drive a car on a dirt lot. Officer Jacob Carlson was shot multiple times by Wolosin and nearly died. City attorney John Henley told the Casper Star-Tribune he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. Prosecutors previously determined the officers’ actions were justified.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/23/mariachi-mass-water-cutbacks-maine-bicentennial-news-around-states/118462240/", "title": "Mariachi Mass, water cutbacks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is urging college football fans to get vaccinated before heading to stadiums this season. The first games kick off in a few weeks, raising concerns that crowded stadiums could help spread COVID-19. Asked about those concerns last week, the Republican governor said the remedy is for more people to get inoculated. “If everybody would just get the vaccine, we wouldn’t have a problem. Simply get the shot, then go enjoy your football game,” Ivey said after participating in an event with college mascots on the steps of the state Capitol. Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s state health officer, said the state Department of Public Health has issued guidance on sporting events including recommending spacing and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations. “Outdoor events are safer in general than indoor events, but having hundreds of thousands of people getting together during a pandemic is going to result in some disease transmission,” Harris said. “We hope people are vaccinated enough that that can be minimized.” Alabama coach Nick Saban has also been an outspoken advocate for getting vaccinated and participated in a public service announcement over the summer encouraging Alabamians to get the shots. The state has one of the nation’s lowest rates of fully vaccinated residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The city could see nearly a half-million cruise ship visitors next year after a new docking agreement was announced with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal between the cruise line and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal came last week as one of the world’s largest cruise ships arrived, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “It ensures they have a place to bring their ships and additional ships to Sitka for the future,” said Chris McGraw, manager of Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Halibut Point Marine, owned by McGraw’s family, is majority owner of the cruise terminal. The Royal Caribbean ship Ovation of the Seas, which is 1,138 feet long – or nearly the length of four football fields placed end-to-end – arrived Tuesday. Officials said the visit got off to a great Alaska start, with a bear walking along the dock as the ship pulled in. The ship’s arrival marked the formal completion of a cruise terminal dock expansion that McGraw called “phase one” of plans intended to position Sitka as a premier port in Alaska. The Ovation of the Seas, which can hold up to 4,900 guests, brought about 1,500 passengers to Sitka. There were fewer travelers aboard because of COVID-19 mitigation measures.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: After more than a year of silence due to the pandemic, mariachis are back playing Sunday services at Tucson’s St. Augustine Cathedral, where the colorful and sonorous tradition dates back a half-century and fuses Roman Catholicism with Mexican American pride. For the hundreds of worshippers gathered in this Spanish colonial church and other congregations across the Southwest, the unique sound of mariachi liturgy evokes a borderlands identity where spirituality and folk music have blended for centuries. “Syncretism is the reality of this land, the ‘ambos’ reality,” said the Rev. Alan Valencia, the cathedral’s rector, who grew up attending mariachi Mass in “ambos Nogales,” or “both Nogales,” as locals refer to the two cities of the same name straddling the U.S.-Mexican border about 60 miles to the south. “And that’s what we see in these mariachi Masses,” he said. “Faith and culture come together and grow.” The first canon of mariachi Mass was composed in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after the Vatican encouraged the incorporation of regional musical traditions into services in the 1960s. Called the Misa Panamericana, or Pan-American Mass, it features a specific order of instrumental arrangements, sung prayers and hymns, according to Dan Sheehy, director and curator of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 33 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 2,400 new coronavirus cases Friday as Arkansas reached a new high for virus patients on ventilators. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began rose to 6,614, while coronavirus cases increased by 2,407 to 431,507 total. The number of COVID-19 patients in the state’s hospitals dropped by 13 to 1,397, but only 19 intensive care unit beds were available across the entire state, the department said. There were 343 COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a new high for the state, while 533 were in ICUs. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks due to the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Only about 39% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated against the disease. The state on Thursday reported 9,143 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines were given. “We must continue to work to increase vaccinations,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “Our children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and need our help to stay healthy.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden City became the first major city in the nation to require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 on Friday for people dining inside restaurants, working out in gyms or attending indoor concerts. Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff to begin verifying people’s proof of vaccination before allowing them in. “There’s definitely some anxiety around how it’s all going to work,” said Pete Sittnick, a managing partner of Waterbar and EPIC Steak restaurants on the city’s waterfront. He anticipates a slowdown in checking in diners, possible pushback from guests who disagree with the requirement and awkward scenarios where someone shows up without proper documentation. “The good thing is, if somebody doesn’t have their verification of vaccination, they can still eat outside,” he said. Mayor London Breed announced the requirement more than a week ago in an attempt to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying she was worried the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus could disrupt the city’s economic rebound. The mandate goes further than New York City, which requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of high-risk indoor activities, and New Orleans, which requires proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for indoor dining or drinking.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he has a “breakthrough” case of COVID-19. The first-term Democrat issued a statement saying he tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating at the direction of Congress’ attending physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan. Hickenlooper said he was “feeling much better.” “I’m grateful for the vaccine (and the scientists behind it) for limiting my symptoms and allowing us to continue our work for Colorado,” Hickenlooper said. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, don’t wait for the virus – get the shot today, and a booster when it’s available too!” Infections and illnesses can happen even after being vaccinated. Experts say inoculation could help make any illnesses less severe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that newer variants of the coronavirus could be a factor in “breakthrough” cases. Hickenlooper, 69, is a former brewpub entrepreneur, Denver mayor and two-term governor who defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in the 2020 election.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A year after receiving a huge influx of federal aid for the mailing of absentee ballot applications, town clerks across the state are facing the prospect of not having enough money to do the same for Nov. 2 local elections. They told the Connecticut Post local budgets were set months ago, and there may not be additional money for printing, postage and office workers. Absentee ballots are supposed to be ready for the public by Oct. 1. “With cities and towns finalizing their annual budgets in the spring, town clerks do not have the necessary funds built into their current budget to cover the costs of postage and staff to process the possible increase in applications,” Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, told the newspaper. The secretary of state’s office said a provision in the state budget allows people to continue to cite pandemic-related concerns to request using voting by mail or drop-off ballots this year. The $15 million in federal support for state elections last year, which also included cybersecurity measures, was a one-time event and is not available this year, the Post reports. A spokesperson for Secretary of the State Denise Merrill blamed the lack of funding this year on Republicans in the Legislature who oppose mail-in balloting.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Current and former students of the University of Delaware can pursue claims that the school breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge ruled Friday. Judge Stephanos Bibas said the students have plausibly alleged that the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” Bibas wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Bibas also said that, even if the university was justified in breaking any such promise because of COVID-19, it should not be unjustly enriched in doing so and may have to return the money it saved, if any, when it went online. The judge rejected the university’s arguments that it expressly reserved the right to go online and that the case involves claims of “educational malpractice,” which many states prohibit. Bibas also rejected the university’s argument that parents who paid their children’s tuition and fees do not have standing in the lawsuit because they had no duty to shoulder those costs and were not personally deprived of campus services or in-person classes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a flash notice sent to all officers and members of the agency Thursday, the Metropolitan Police Department activated the entire force and postponed vacation days in anticipation of a Sept. 18 protest organized by supporters of Jan. 6 insurrection defendants, WUSA-TV reports. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. Matt Braynard, the head of data for the 2016 Trump campaign, announced the September gathering on Steve Bannon’s podcast, issuing a clarion call for his followers to seek justice for those charged in the riots two weeks before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. “As we continue to raise the profile of these individuals, it makes it harder and harder for the left’s phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,” Braynard said on Bannon’s podcast released July 30. “What’s going to define (the rally) is where it’s going to take place: We’re going back to the Capitol.” In a YouTube video, Braynard specifically asked rally attendees not to bring signs relitigating the 2020 election, including visible markers of support for specific political candidates.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The mayor asked residents Friday to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars immediately, saying water usage needed to be cut back because of the recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Orlando Utility Commission treats the city’s water with liquid oxygen, and supplies that ordinarily go toward water treatment have been diverted to hospitals for patients suffering from the coronavirus, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We acknowledge that the No. 1 priority for the liquid oxygen should be for hospitals,” Dyer said at a news conference. Since the 1990s, the utility has used liquid oxygen to remove the slight discoloration and rotten-egg smell that is found naturally in Florida’s water supply. The city-owned utility typically goes through 10 trucks of liquid oxygen a week, but its supplier recently said it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, said Linda Ferrone, OUC’s chief customer and marketing officer. About 40% of the utility commission’s potable water is used for irrigation, so any strains on the water supply will be greatly reduced if residents stop watering their lawns, washing their cars or using pressure washers, she said. On its website, the utility said residents should prepare to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayors of some of the state’s largest cities on Friday slammed Gov. Brian Kemp’s new order that aims to limit local efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter, the mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County suggested the Republican governor was putting politics above public health, and they defended mask requirements. “While Governor Kemp may find it politically necessary to hew to the course of others who live in the shadow of the former president, we are more concerned with the health and livelihood of friends we see in the grocery store, at the schools where we bring our children each morning, and who we encounter as we head into work,” the four mayors – all Democrats – wrote in the letter. “They overwhelmingly articulate support for the smart, tested public health measures that we have promoted for the past eighteen months.” An email to the governor’s office was not immediately returned. Amid a new surge of coronavirus cases that is straining hospitals, Kemp signed an executive order Thursday that says cities cannot require businesses and sports teams to enforce local pandemic restrictions. The governor presented the move as a way to protect businesses, saying some people in the state wanted to return to “lockdown mode” and close businesses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s surging COVID-19 cases have overwhelmed its contact tracing efforts. Hawaii News Now reports the Department of Health recently expanded its contact tracing team to 313 people from 269 but still struggles to keep up with the hundreds of people newly infected each day with the coronavirus. In the middle of July, department data showed contact tracers were able to reach about 90% of people who were infected. The latest data for the first week of August showed they were only able to reach 62%. “One thing we’re seeing is there are a lot more people not picking up the phone,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the Hawaii state epidemiologist. “That aside, we are seeing a record number of case counts in the state. Of course, that is a challenge to try to reach everyone.” A West Oahu hospital filled up Friday as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases. Jason Chang, CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems, said the Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It has also asked staff from other parts of the Queen’s system to come help. The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital with 25 cots. Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Gov. Brad Little is directing $30 million to expand coronavirus testing in K-12 schools. The money is coming from emergency funds set aside by the Legislature to deal with unforeseen events, Little said. “It’s critical now,” the Republican governor said this month. “These school districts have got to have some resources.” House Republicans earlier this year killed a bill to use $40 million in federal coronavirus relief funds for voluntary testing in public and private schools. Little urged residents who haven’t been vaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots to help avoid disruptions at schools and the potential to overrun hospitals with coronavirus patients. He also said workers getting sick and schools shutting down because of coronavirus outbreaks and parents forced to stay home to care for kids and miss work could slow the state’s economic rebound. “Our workforce cannot afford to stay home because schools and day cares shut down due to outbreaks,” he said. “This threatens Idaho’s phenomenal economic success.” The Gem State has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with just over half of people ages 12 and up fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Masks will be required indoors throughout Cook County beginning Monday, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The Cook County Department of Public Health issued the order Friday, saying it’s needed as new coronavirus cases continue to increase due to the more contagious delta variant. “We are in a dangerous period, with the delta variant surging, during which we must return to previous remediation measures,” said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead and senior medical officer of Cook County Department of Public Health. “We have no choice but to mandate that people wear masks indoors to help contain this spread of the virus.” Illinois reported 4,904 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Friday. That pushed the state’s seven-day average of new cases above the peak of a COVID-19 surge this spring. The health department order applies to all multi-unit residential buildings and public places such as restaurants, stores, fitness clubs and public transportation in suburban Cook County. Chicago reinstated its indoor mask mandate effective Friday, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already said masks are required in all schools. The mandate applies to anyone over age 2. Businesses also are required to post signs saying masks are required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials have counted about 62,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines being tossed out in recent months across the state as the number of people seeking the shots has fallen drastically. That is about 1% of the some 6 million shots that have been given in Indiana since they first became available in December, but it’s a sign of the struggle that officials face in raising the vaccination rate. The state health department said doses can go unused by reaching their expiration date or a vial breaking, and officials knew eventually vaccine supply would outstrip demand. “We are taking every action possible to minimize wastage, including urging providers to use doses with the nearest expiration dates first and encouraging Hoosiers to get vaccinated if they are eligible,” the agency said in a statement. “In addition, we have been working with healthcare providers to allow them to order small batches of vaccine to have in their offices for patients and have increased the number of mobile vaccination clinics we are deploying across the state.” About 45% of Indiana residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the 16th-lowest rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The city’s new mask mandate would impose the requirement on the University of Iowa’s campus, but the school will continue to strongly encourage but not require masks per guidance handed down from its own governing body, the state’s Board of Regents. Iowa City’s mandate announced Thursday evening goes against state law, said a spokesperson for Gov. Kim Reynolds, calling it “not enforceable.” May 2 guidance from the state’s Board of Regents says face masks are not required at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. Legally speaking, the regents could choose to make them required. The Board of Regents, as well as University of Iowa leadership, have not changed course on COVID-19 protocols ahead of the school year despite pressure from students and faculty to make them stronger, including mask and vaccine requirements or stronger incentivization. This month faculty and students sent a petition to the state’s board of Regents, and three faculty senate leaders sent a letter directly to President Barbara Wilson. Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague declared a civil emergency and ordered a mask mandate late Thursday night. It applies to everyone within the limits of Iowa City when in public spaces where maintaining 6 feet of distance is not possible.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday called for school districts to require masks and said she was contemplating an emergency declaration as hospitals buckle under the strain of increasingly young COVID-19 patients and as hundreds of students and staff become infected. “We really want people to understand that this is no fooling around,” Kelly lamented while speaking at Saint Luke’s South Hospital in Overland Park, which is brimming with patients. “This is an emergency.” The latest health department data shows 154 school clusters, with 1,889 cases. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported that 82 students and staff were infected in just the first nine days of the academic year, with 220 quarantined. The Turner school district began requiring masks after more than two dozen students were infected. The Wichita district, which is the state’s largest and isn’t requiring masks, has had “a few” COVID-19 cases since classes started last week, said spokeswoman Susan Arensman. She said the district won’t provide weekly updates on cases until next month. The school board for Perry-Lecompton public schools, where 16 students are quarantining, imposed a mask mandate Thursday night. “These are students that are not in school right now and cannot learn because of COVID,” Superintendent J.B. Elliott said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Top Republican lawmakers are promising to work with Gov. Andy Beshear to fight COVID-19 after a court ruling cleared the way for new limits on the Democratic governor’s emergency powers. Beshear’s allies said they’ll be watching to see if his critics follow through. Kentucky Republicans cheered the state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that ordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that for months had blocked the GOP-backed laws. It comes as the highly contagious delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The court’s decision “signals it is time for the Republican leadership to publicly put forth their plan to protect the commonwealth from this pandemic and the deadly delta variant,” said Rep. Joni Jenkins and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top Democrats in the Kentucky House and Senate. “We know what they don’t support; show us your plan.” The top legislative Republicans – House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers – said lawmakers are “ready to work with the governor, as we have for nearly a year and a half, and address what is a very real public health crisis.” The GOP holds supermajorities in both chambers, and Republicans accused Beshear of taking a go-it-alone approach in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Stressed with too little staff and too many patients in an unrelenting COVID-19 resurgence, some hospitals are pressing insurance companies to ease up on requirements that can slow the transfer of recuperating patients to other facilities. At issue are “Medicare Advantage” plans that supplement government-funded Medicare coverage. These insurance policies require extensive reviews and sometimes consultations with other doctors before transfers to inpatient facilities providing skilled nursing care, rehabilitation or long-term care. Some of these patients are clearly ready to be moved to a non-hospital setting, but the bureaucracy has them stuck in badly needed beds, said Dr. Leslie Dean, of the Willis-Knighton system in northwest Louisiana. “It’s almost impossible for them to move these people along in a timely manner right now because of these delays with some of these insurance plans, unfortunately,” she said. The delays are critical as COVID-19 numbers grow, but the issue doesn’t just involve coronavirus patients. The paperwork also can slow transfers of Medicare Advantage-covered patients recuperating from a stroke, a heart attack, or some other illness or injury that will need post-hospital attention. Statewide hospitalizations have set records almost daily through most of August.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: The pandemic put the kibosh on most of the state’s bicentennial celebrations last year, but Maine proved Saturday that it’s never too late for an old-fashioned parade. Riding in a 3D-printed boat created at the University of Maine, Gov. Janet Mills served as grand marshal of the pandemic-delayed State of Maine Bicentennial Parade that snaked its way through the cities of Lewiston and Auburn. Mills said the state has persevered in the pandemic “with the grit and grace that have shaped our state for generations.” “The Bicentennial Parade is another opportunity to honor the resilience of Maine people, to remember our history and to recommit to creating a better and brighter future for us all,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. The parade was held against a backdrop of a surge in coronavirus infections caused by the delta variant and an ongoing debate over rules put in place by the Mills administration to protect residents. Protesters opposed to the governor’s vaccination mandate for health care workers gathered on a bridge between the cities before the parade started to make their point. Some exchanged words with the governor’s supporters. Later, dozens of protesters followed the boat in which the governor was riding and shouted at her. Mills ignored them and waved to the crowd.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan, a cancer survivor, said Sunday that he’s received a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and he’s urging the federal government to make booster shots available earlier than currently planned. Hogan appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he received the additional dose this past week on the recommendation of his doctors. Asked if he wanted Marylanders to get the booster shot as soon as possible or wait the eight months that is currently recommended under federal guidelines, he said: “No, we can’t wait that long.” He said he’s pushing the federal government to speed up the time frame for providing booster shots, and he’s pushing for full FDA approval of the vaccines. He said many of those who have refused to get the shots have cited the fact that the available vaccines do not have full approval but are being administered under an emergency use authorization. Federal officials announced last week a plan to start administering booster shots to the general public beginning the week of Sept. 20. The recommendations call for people to wait eight months from their second dose, which they said was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall. Some public health experts have said a booster shot administered too early won’t be as effective.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Masks will be required for all indoor public places starting this Friday as the city moves to contain rising coronavirus infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, acting Mayor Kim Janey said late last week. Janey’s office issued a statement saying the mandate will apply to everyone age 2 and older who enters a business, retail shop, club, government office or any other public venue. Janey said the mask mandate was being imposed ahead of the arrival of more than 50,000 college students from across the nation and a return to classes for more than 50,000 Boston Public School students. “There is nothing more important than Boston’s safe recovery, reopening, and renewal from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We know that masks work best when everyone wears one. Requiring masks indoors is a proactive public health measure to limit transmission of the delta variant, boost the public confidence in our businesses and venues, and protect the residents of our city who are too young for vaccination.” On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker said tens of thousands of state workers will need to prove they’re fully inoculated against COVID-19 by October or risk losing their jobs. Massachusetts remains one of the most vaccinated states in the nation, with more than 64% of residents fully inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: The Michigan Court of Appeals has granted a new hearing to a man who claimed his rights were violated when he was sentenced for a crime by video, a common practice during the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Christian participated and spoke during a hearing last fall in Oakland County court and had a lawyer present. But the appeals court still found problems. “At no point during the hearing did the trial court obtain a waiver of defendant’s right to be physically present in the courtroom for sentencing,” judges Jane Markey and Brock Swartzle said in a 2-1 opinion Thursday. Christian, 38, was convicted of uttering and publishing, a crime typically related to forging documents, and sentenced to a minimum of a year in prison. Judge Michael Riordan disagreed with the majority, saying Christian failed to show that the error “affected substantial rights.” “He has not shown or even argued, for example, that he would have received a lighter sentence if he was physically present,” Riordan said. Christian remains in prison for other unrelated crimes in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: St. Cloud State University and St. Cloud Technical & Community College, alongside all Minnesota state colleges and universities, will mandate COVID-19 vaccination or frequent coronavirus testing for certain student groups, according to a memo from Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The memo, sent Wednesday to Minnesota State’s Leadership Council, said the system’s schools would require vaccination attestation for “specific student groups or populations that are in settings where there is close and frequent contact with others.” That includes students living in residence facilities run by the school system, those participating in intercollegiate athletics, and those required to by clinical or internship sites. Additionally, the memo said, colleges and universities could include other extracurriculars that pose difficulties for social distancing. As of Friday, the technical and community college hadn’t had conversations about student groups, though the school is limiting large group gatherings. Vice President of Administration Lori Kloos said extracurricular activities are being kept to a minimum but may continue in different ways, such as meeting outside or virtually.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Two concert venues are now requiring guests to provide proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or show negative coronavirus test results. The Lyric and Proud Larry’s in Oxford announced last week that they would implement the requirements, The Oxford Eagle reports. Lyric general manager Lindsay Dillon-Maginnis said the regulations have been a trend nationwide for music festivals. “Promoters who have been in our line of work, we could see the storm coming,” Dillon-Maginnis told the paper. Not every venue in Mississippi is following suit. Entertainer Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit announced Friday that they would pull out of a show at the Brandon Amphitheater scheduled for October. Isbell said the venue would not require that attendees show proof of vaccination or a negative test. “Unfortunately, the powers that be were not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” a statement from Southeastern Records said. Dillon-Maginnis said there has been “overwhelmingly large majority of support” for the policy, with less than 1% of ticket holders requesting a refund. “I think what people see online or what you see in comments is vitriolic or negative,” she said. “But with those people, if you dig deeper, have no connection to the Lyric or Oxford or even Mississippi.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: New COVID-19 hospital admissions are reaching winter surge levels in the city, and southeast Missouri hospitals are under strain due to a surge in coronavirus cases and a rise in deaths. On Thursday, hospitals in St. Louis reported admitting 100 new patients with COVID-19 – the most since Jan. 16, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. A total of 585 people were hospitalized, including 25 children, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Twelve of those children are younger than 12 and not yet eligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Southeast Hospital and Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau has increased by more than 50% in the past week and a half, according to data released Thursday by both facilities. Saint Francis, which reopened its COVID-19 care unit last week, reported 39 coronavirus inpatients as of early Thursday afternoon, up from 25 just 10 days ago. At Southeast Hospital, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased from 22 about 10 days ago to 32 as of Thursday morning, the Southeast Missourian reports. Statewide, the death toll from the rapidly spreading delta variant continues to rise in Missouri, with July shaping up to be an even deadlier month than earlier reported.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While many large companies across the U.S. have announced that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for their employees to return to work in person, Montana stands alone in banning such mandates. Under a new law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed “discrimination” and a violation of the state’s human rights laws. Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a law like this for private employers, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The law has raised concern among employers across the state as Montana struggles with a rise in COVID-19 cases that is once again straining the state’s health care system. Pushback swelled last week when physicians called on the Legislature to reverse the law. “This is against everything we’ve ever known or believed about public health,” said Dr. Pamela Cutler, president of the Montana Medical Association. “I believe it’s a travesty now, and it needs to be fixed so that we can make our offices safe for patients and our co-workers.” GOP lawmakers who supported the bill in the Legislature said it was needed in response to employers “coercing” employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Medical Center on Friday announced it’s reducing inpatient surgeries at the Omaha hospital because of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change will take effect Aug. 30, Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said in a news release. Wilson said inpatient surgeries likely will be limited through October. Nebraska Medicine is not limiting surgeries at Bellevue Medical Center or any other outpatient surgery clinics. Wilson said the rise in coronavirus patients, who need extra care and resources, strained Nebraska Medical Center. On top of that, he said, Nebraska is facing a nursing shortage. Nebraskans can help to ease the strain on hospitals by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Wilson said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Half of all eligible residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the state closer to the national inoculation rate of about 60% for all people 12 and older, state health officials said. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the 50% mark for residents 12 and up who are now fully vaccinated is an “incredible milestone to reach.” “We know there is more work to be done and we will remain focused on promoting vaccine opportunities throughout the state,” he said in a statement. Among those 12 and older, 60.5% have initiated vaccination, receiving at least one dose of vaccine, officials said. Nationally, 59.8% of that age group was fully vaccinated, and 70.4% had received the first of two shots as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada’s 14-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases and positivity rate both declined through the week after a steady rise began in early June. At an emergency meeting Friday, the state Board of Health approved a vaccine mandate plan for Nevada’s public colleges and universities scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. The requirement will not affect enrollment until the spring semester.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives will begin holding committee meetings on retained bills this week, without the option to participate remotely that existed during much of the coronavirus pandemic. In the calendar published Friday, House Speaker Sherman Packard reminded lawmakers that the emergency order allowing public bodies to meet remotely without a physical quorum present in the same location expired when the governor lifted the state of emergency June 11. That means House committees meeting to discuss bills that were set aside for more work must meet in person at the Legislative Office Building, which has reopened to the public. Packard said dozens of additional air purification units have been set up throughout the office building and Statehouse, and each meeting room will have air treatment that meets or exceeds federal health guidelines for office buildings. Masks will be encouraged but not required.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A group of parents wants Gov. Phil Murphy to remove the ban on virtual learning for the 2021-22 school year and provide a permanent remote learning option for K-12 schools. A change.org petition started by New Jersey Parents for Virtual Choice has garnered more than 17,000 signatures. The parents are driven by a variety of reasons, some related to health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus and the highly transmissible delta variant, said group spokesperson Karen Strauss. Some parents want to retain the virtual learning option from last year because their children excelled, she said. The petition asks Murphy to let K-12 schools continue to offer virtual learning for parents who want it and to create a permanent virtual learning option by approving free virtual-only public or charter schools. It also asks Murphy to meet with the group. “New Jersey needs to catch up,” Strauss said, referring to school systems in other states that offer virtual learning options. Strauss said she wants a virtual option for her 5-year-old son, who has asthma and high-functioning autism. She said he thrived during remote learning last year even though it took some getting used to, but her primary consideration is his health. “We already lost someone to COVID. I’m not risking him getting sick,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: About 150 people protested in front of the state Capitol on Friday, demanding an end to vaccine mandates for health care workers. Many protesters identified themselves as hospital workers – nurses, nursing assistants and clerical workers. Other attendees included correctional officers, retirees and children of health care workers. A state mandate requires nurses and other workers in high-risk environments to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and some hospitals have their own mandates. “I believe the vaccine is harmful,” said practical nurse Katrina Philpot, who was picketing along the road outside the Capitol complex with a sign that read: “Healthcare workers deserve rights.” Philpot said the hospital where she works in Rio Rancho is requiring her to be vaccinated by Aug. 27 or be fired. She fears she won’t qualify for medical or religious exemptions to the mandate. State employees, including prison guards, are required to get COVID-19 shots or submit to weekly testing. At least one prison guard has sued the state over the mandate. New Mexico has outpaced neighboring states when it comes to getting people vaccinated. About two-thirds of residents 18 and up have been fully inoculated, but state health officials have warned that evidence shows vaccinated people can still get infected and spread the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public schools will require COVID-19 shots for student-athletes and coaches participating in “high-risk” sports including football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, lacrosse, rugby and bowling, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The students and coaches will have to get at least one dose of vaccine before the start of competitive play, de Blasio said on radio station WNYC. Bowling, while not a contact sport like football or wrestling, is on the list because it is indoors, de Blasio said. Masks will be required for all students and staff when school starts Sept. 13, but while the mayor has urged all New Yorkers who are eligible for COVID-19 shots to get them, vaccination is not required either for school staff or for students over age 12. Asked about the possibility of requiring public school teachers to be vaccinated, de Blasio said: “We’re actively looking right now at different actions we could take.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law Friday. The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers. It comes even as the U.S. and North Carolina see a marked rise in coronavirus cases due to a highly contagious variant. The measure, which received nearly unanimous support in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, also states that trained pharmacy technicians and interns can administer a COVID-19 or flu vaccine under a pharmacist’s supervision. “This important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,” Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing. Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use – such as the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer – and administered by any health care provider. State law had given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues, including communicable diseases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Amid a COVID-19 resurgence, advocates are calling on nursing homes to require that all staff members get vaccinated, and a nonprofit tracking the latest data says there haven’t been enough workers getting on board. The latest COVID-19 dashboard from AARP shows that only 24% of senior care facilities in North Dakota have met the industry target of having at least 75% of their staffs inoculated against the disease. Josh Askvig, state director of AARP North Dakota, said experts don’t want to go back to last fall, when the state saw some of the highest coronavirus death rates among patients. “What’s concerning right now is as new variants are emerging, facilities cannot let preventable problems be repeated,” Askvig said. “We’ve got to increase vaccinations, and we’ve got to do it now.” The latest AARP dashboard also shows nearly 12% of North Dakota nursing homes lack personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Askvig said the state should help to ensure they have enough supplies. As for the vaccinations, he said facilities need to step up in the area. “They’ve got the resources through the different relief funding to get it done,” Askvig said. “And so we’re encouraging everyone eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: While COVID-19 cases have reportedly risen nationally among children, that trend has yet to show up locally. Instead, another common virus has squeezed Nationwide Children’s Hospital in recent weeks: The pediatric hospital is dealing with a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, which usually begins circulating more in the fall rather than late summer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why RSV is showing up again now, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely the cause, said Dr. Mike Patrick, an emergency department physician at Nationwide Children’s. With everyone masking up, staying home and keeping their distance, RSV didn’t spread as easily in 2020. Now that more families are getting out and doing things, and kids are returning to school and day care, RSV is able to spread, Patrick said. “No one knows for certain what is driving this,” he said. “But being isolated and behind masks and then suddenly reintroducing people together really fuels the spread of these viral illnesses.” The spike in RSV cases is similar to what Nationwide Children’s usually sees at its peak in winter, Patrick said. But Patrick said he worries whether COVID-19 cases could also start showing up more in kids seeking treatment at Nationwide Children’s.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is criticizing both a northeast Oklahoma school district that adopted a mask mandate and President Joe Biden over comments that the state’s ban on school mask requirements ban may violate a coronavirus aid package for schools. The Republican governor and state Attorney General John O’Connor released a joint statement Thursday criticizing the Hulbert school district for its mask requirement. “It is disappointing that one school district has chosen to openly violate a state law that was supported by 80 percent of the Legislature,” Stitt said in the statement. The district’s policy includes an opt-out option for medical reasons. Earlier this month Stitt praised two Oklahoma City school districts for mask mandates that included opt-out options for medical, religious or personal reasons. O’Connor said that the law is constitutional and that the state is fighting a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Stitt’s criticism of Biden comes after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to him and state school Superintendent Joy Hofmeister on Wednesday that the school mask ban may violate the American Rescue Plan that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Managers from a senior living facility say a video posted to social media by a recruiter for the company saying she would hire unvaccinated health care workers does not reflect the company’s views. Shayna Hall, a recruiter for Salem-based Bonaventure Senior Living, a senior assisted living community with locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado, posted the video on TikTok last month, as first reported by the Salem Reporter. In the video, which has been deleted from Hall’s account but can still be found on other posters’ accounts, Hall says she came across medical workers posting on TikTok about being fired or forced out of their jobs because they refuse to get a “brand new vaccine.” “I just wanted to tell you if you are a nurse, a caregiver, a med tech, and you now need a new job because of this, hit me up, I’ll hire you,” she says in the video. “I need nurses, caregivers, med techs in Washington, Colorado and Oregon. Take your pick.” While the COVID-19 vaccines are new, the research behind them is not. Scientists around the world have been working on vaccines for the SARS coronavirus for more 20 years. Hall’s video swiftly ignited controversy online. Many have decried the company’s willingness to hire unvaccinated employees to serve elderly and high-risk residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate dropped to a new post-pandemic low in July, and the labor force shrank, as payrolls jumped by nearly 29,000, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6% from June’s adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. The national rate was 5.4% in July, more than a point below Pennsylvania’s. The figures come out as the federal government prepares to end supplemental payments of $300 a week to people who lost jobs or self-employment income during the pandemic. The $300 payments last through the week ending Sept. 3. In a survey of households, the labor force shrank by 16,000 in July, closer to 6.3 million. However, the number of employed grew slightly, while the number of unemployed slid by 19,000. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic hit. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls grew in July by 28,800, to above 5.7 million. The state has regained about 65% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million just before the pandemic hit, according to state figures. The leisure and hospitality sector led all gainers, adding 16,000 jobs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s downtown arts festival has been canceled for the second year in a row amid rising cases of COVID-19, city officials announced Friday. PVDFest, a weekend festival that typically draws more 100,000 people to downtown Providence, was scheduled to make its comeback Sept. 25-26. But officials said it would be unsafe to continue amid high levels of coronavirus transmission. Mayor Jorge Elorza said the decision was made “after carefully considering the increased spread of the delta variant.” “Together we can beat this virus and return to dancing and celebrating together downtown next year,” Elorza said in a statement. Although the downtown event is canceled, smaller outdoor art programs affiliated with the festival will continue in the coming weeks. Officials said face masks will be strongly recommended. Rhode Island is averaging about 310 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from about 196 a day two weeks ago. The festival was started in 2015 and has featured more than 5,000 artists and performers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health agency became the latest group Friday to ask lawmakers to make it clear that school districts can require students to wear masks without losing state budget money or facing any other penalties. The General Assembly put the mask ban item into the budget in early June when South Carolina was seeing an average of 150 COVID-19 cases a day. Ten weeks later, the state is seeing about 3,520 new cases each day. And that dire new case average comes before about 700,000 public school students completed their first week back in classrooms. Of the more than 5,200 new coronavirus cases reported Friday, more than 500 were in children 10 or younger. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Board voted unanimously Friday to ask the state House and Senate to come back in special session to “provide local authority for mask mandates.” They joined the Republican state education superintendent, House Democrats, teacher groups, an association of school board members, a group of two Democratic and two Republican state senators, several school boards, and other groups that have asked lawmakers to reconsider the mask ban.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she is planning to focus on water, sewer and broadband infrastructure projects as the state plans to spend nearly $1 billion in federal funds meant to help towns and cities recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The state government is readying to receive $974.5 million from the federal government over the next year and a half. Over the course of the pandemic, South Dakota has been alloted more than $4.8 billion in federal relief funds – a windfall that nearly matches the state’s annual budget. Under the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress, state and local governments must use the funds to respond to COVID-19. They can use the money for public health programs, addressing the financial fallout of the pandemic, replacing lost revenues, paying for essential workers, or infrastructure. The Republiacn governor said the state has “broad flexibility” in using the money. Meanwhile, daily coronavirus cases across the state on Friday topped 300 for the first time in more than six months as a fresh pandemic wave appeared to build. In the past two weeks, the state has seen case counts spike by 270%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. However, the number of cases per capita in that time has remained one of the lowest in the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Bluff City teens have been leading the state’s surge of recent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 15-19 age group in the Memphis region showed the greatest growth of any age group across the state’s eight regions from late July through last week, according to a new study by researchers at the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine. Vaccinations among residents ages 12-14 also grew, according to the study. The increase in vaccinations comes as infections and hospitalizations surged through July and August, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The burden of new COVID-19 cases across the state is among the Tennessee’s younger populations, who are also less likely to be inoculated, researchers concluded. Findings show infections have grown the most among people in their early 20s. The two western Tennessee regions saw the greatest vaccination growth, according to the study, though each of the eight regions in the state saw growth in vaccinations beginning in late July. The state’s metropolitan areas of Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis have the highest vaccination rates in nearly all age groups, the researchers wrote. The lowest rates are among the Upper Cumberland region of Cookeville and surrounding counties.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The lieutenant governor blamed rising hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 on unvaccinated Black people in comments that were quickly denounced as racist. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the remarks Thursday night on a Fox News segment in response to question about the latest coronavirus surge in Texas, which is seeing its highest hospitalization rates since January. “The biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated,” Patrick said. He did not change course Friday, saying that “Democrat social media trolls” misstated facts and that he had used state data in his assertions. But statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services don’t back that. Black people – who make up about 12% of Texas’ population – accounted for about 15% of total COVID-19 cases and just more than 10% of deaths. Patrick also told Fox News that Democrats were to blame for low vaccination rates among Black people, who frequently support that party, even though he believes Republicans should persuade more people to get their shots, too. But he also tiptoed around that issue, which has been sensitive for the GOP. About 8% of Texans who have been fully vaccinated are Black, according to state data. The resulting percentage of Black people who’ve been inoculated is unclear.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The mayor announced Friday that she had issued a mask order in the city’s K-12 schools as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she used her emergency powers to issue the order and plans to work with health officials to determine when it can be lifted. “As Mayor it is my responsibility to do everything I can to keep our City, and our school district, from going down the tragic and dangerous path many others are already on,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. The order came a week after the Salt Lake County Council overturned a school mask order for kids under 12 that the county’s top health official issued. Mendenhall said the majority of board members had privately told her they feared retaliation and urged her to issue the order. “Unfortunately, and despite all the evidence that masks protect children and the adults who care for them, this issue has become politicized to the point that elected bodies across the country, and in the State of Utah, worry about retaliation if they take stand as an organization,” she wrote. Masks were required in classrooms last year, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule with the support of elected county leaders, but anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state and Vermont Legal Aid have reached a settlement over the end of a hotel voucher program for some of the homeless population during the pandemic, the Vermont Agency of Human Services and the legal services group announced Friday. Under the settlement, eligibility for the general assistance emergency housing program will be expanded for people with disabilities, and a formal process will be created for applicants whose health or welfare would be at risk due to their disability if they were unsheltered, the groups said. Last year Vermont expanded eligibility for the program during the pandemic to allow more people to stay temporarily in hotels and motels. It ended the program for some in July and gave $2,500 checks to those who were no longer eligible. Vermont Legal Aid sued, and a judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for some people to show they had a disability and could remain eligible. “People with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness will now be able to access GA benefits even if they are able to work,” Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Jessica Radbord said in a statement. “We believe this will protect some truly vulnerable members of our community from suffering negative health consequences as a result of being unsheltered.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: More than 200 University of Virginia students who didn’t comply with the school’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement have been disenrolled ahead of the fall semester. The move affected 238 students, including 49 students who were enrolled in fall courses, The Virginian-Pilot reports. That may mean that “a good number” of the remaining students “may not have been planning to return to the university this fall at all,” university spokesperson Brian Coy said. The students were disenrolled after “receiving multiple reminders via email, text, phone calls, calls to parents that they were out of compliance,” Coy said. They can reenroll if they comply with the vaccine requirement or file an exemption by Wednesday. About 96.6% of students have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a news release. The university granted 335 permanent vaccine waivers for students with religious or medical exemptions. The university also granted 184 temporary vaccine waivers for students who couldn’t get inoculated but intend to get a COVID-19 shot once on campus. Exempt students must be tested weekly for the coronavirus and wear a mask in indoor and outdoor common spaces.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for state workers comes at a time when the state ferry system is experiencing a severe staffing shortage. KUOW reports that in an Aug. 13 notice, Washington State Ferries Chief of Staff Nicole McIntosh said there were “an unprecedented 91 relief requests yesterday.” She thanked the crew members who helped cover for their absent colleagues. In response to the shortage, the agency canceled sailings and went from two ferries on the Edmonds-Kingston and Clinton-Mukilteo routes to one. Washington State Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling said staffing issues have been a chronic problem throughout the pandemic, but that week was “as bad as it’s been, due to the labor shortage, due to people out with active COVID or having to quarantine.” Capt. Dan Twohig, the regional representative of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of several unions representing ferry service workers, said last week’s staff shortages were an anomaly. A coalition of unions representing Washington State Ferries employees started bargaining with state officials last week over the implementation of the vaccine mandate. Twohig said the unions agree that the mandate is legal and will go forward.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday launched a second round of vaccination sweepstakes, this time with prizes aimed at enticing younger residents to sign up for COVID-19 shots as the pandemic continues to worsen. The first of six weekly drawings will be held Aug. 31. Registration opens Monday. All residents must register again for the new drawings, even if they were registered for the first series of prizes earlier this summer, Justice said at a news conference. The prizes include season ticket packages to West Virginia University and Marshall sporting events, ski lift tickets, and a 10-year supply of free gas. Also being given away each week will be a $150,000 dream wedding, a luxury sports car, a custom fishing boat, ATVs or high-end lawnmowers, and college scholarships for residents ages 12 to 25. The governor’s announcement came as the number of people hospitalized statewide from COVID-19 reached 447, the most since late January. More than 1,350 coronavirus cases had been reported statewide in the prior two days alone. Cases of the more contagious delta variant of the virus are now present in at least 46 of the state’s 55 counties, according to health department data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: At least three American Indian tribes in the state will put cash in the pockets of their members and employees to get COVID-19 shots. The Oneida, Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes are offering a $500 incentive for vaccinations. The offer includes those who have already been inoculated. For the Menominee Nation, members ages 12 and older as well as tribal employees who are fully vaccinated on or before Oct. 31 are eligible. Oneida tribal members and employees have until Sept. 30 to show proof of their vaccination to receive the $500. Ho-Chunk Nation members have until Nov. 1 to provide proof. “We know that once we can get at least 75% of our community vaccinated, we’re going to be able to have that level of safety that we can,” said Debbie Danforth, director of the Oneida Nation Division of Health. So far, Danforth said about 5,000 tribal members, or about 30%, have been vaccinated, WLUK-TV reports. The rate for employees is about 50%. Marlon Skenandore, who had COVID-19 last year and is still dealing with its effects, said the incentive is not swaying his decision on whether to get vaccinated. “I’m just hesitant about the FDA not approving it and not going through its normal procedure, so I’m on the fence, but I’m leaning towards getting it,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Grand Teton National Park had its busiest month on record in July. July is almost always the busiest month for tourism in the park in northwestern Wyoming. In July 2021, almost 830,000 people visited, park officials said in a statement. That was up from 796,000 in July 2018, the second-busiest month in records dating to 1979. July was the first time Grand Teton topped 800,000 visitors in a month. Visitation was up almost 10% compared to July 2020, when the park had just reopened after being mostly closed by the coronavirus pandemic. Accompanying the tourism surge, camping was up 2.7%, backcountry camping was up 15%, and trail use was up 21% in July 2021 compared to July 2019. Researchers this summer have been studying the relationship between the number of vehicles entering Grand Teton and visitor traffic at key areas of the park, park officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/08/giant-joystick-hyena-health-moose-loose-news-around-states/49327113/", "title": "Giant joystick, hyena health: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday signed employment protections for workers who claim a religious or health reason for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The Republican governor signed the legislation a day after it was approved by the Alabama Legislature as GOP-led states turn to lawsuits and legislation to fight federal vaccine requirements that they call an infringement on personal liberties. Ivey also signed into law a separate bill requiring parental consent for minors to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The new law says employers in Alabama can’t fire workers for being unvaccinated if the employee returns a new standardized state form to claim a religious or medical exemption. President Joe Biden in September announced contractors who do business with the federal government must have workforces vaccinated, with no option to test out. The Alabama law will also affect companies, such as medical providers, who wanted to independently place vaccination requirements on workers. The bill drew opposition from the Business Council of Alabama, which said it would put federal contractors in a no-win situation. Democrats said Republicans were putting both jobs and public health in jeopardy for the sake of scoring political points.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Department of the Interior said the first two federal land allotments to Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans have been finalized. Frank Nanooruk and Richard Boskoffsky received the first allotments under a 2019 law passed by Congress, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The allotments are east of Goodnews Bay in southwest Alaska, agency spokesperson Richard Packer said by email Friday. The Interior Department said the allotments were finalized Thursday. Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has said that the program’s restrictions kept many from applying until the 1960s. There was a push to urge Alaska Natives to apply for lands if they had not already done so before a 1971 law took effect. But that period overlapped with the Vietnam War. A 1998 federal law allowed veterans to apply for land, but the provisions were seen as restrictive. The 2019 law lifted use and occupancy requirements that were part of prior laws and made lands available until late 2025, the Bureau of Land Management has said. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Education advocates did not collect enough valid signatures to give voters a chance to repeal a new state law exempting some business owners from a tax increase on the wealthy to boost school funding, a lawyer for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Friday. The measure is one of two tax-cut bills signed this year by Gov. Doug Ducey that school-funding advocates are trying to refer to the 2022 ballot. County election officials reviewing a sample of the 123,500 submitted signatures found too many were invalid. Petitioners needed 118,823 valid signatures. The failure to collect enough signatures is not likely to matter much, however, because the Arizona Supreme Court has signaled that the entire tax increase, approved by voters last year as Proposition 208, is likely to be struck down. In addition to the tax exemption for business owners, education groups want voters to have a say on a new flat income tax rate of 2.5%, which would cut taxes by about $2 billion a year, primarily benefiting the wealthy. They turned in significantly more signatures to refer that measure. Lawyers for the Free Enterprise Club, a conservative advocacy group, argued in court Friday that the constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for “support and maintenance” of state government and that tax cut bills fall into that category.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A former state senator convicted in 2018 of corruption-related charges is pushing forward with a request for a new trial. Attorney Lee D. Short of North Little Rock filed notice Wednesday that his client, former Sen. Jon Woods, will take his request for a new trial to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Woods was sentenced to more than 18 years in prison on 15 counts of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering for a bribery scheme in which prosecutors said he and another Republican legislator were taking kickbacks from state grants meant to be directed to nonprofit groups. The scheme involved at least $20 million taken from taxpayers or the nonprofit. The request for a retrial comes after claims that the FBI coerced former state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson into giving incriminating information about Woods that lead to his investigation and subsequent conviction. According to the Democrat-Gazette, the information Hutchinson gave the FBI should have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Four additional state legislators pleaded guilty or were convicted on corruption-related charges in the investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDiamond Bar: Southern California air regulators on Friday approved new restrictions on area oil refineries and other factories that could remove tons of smog-forming pollutants from the air. The board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted rule changes requiring emissions limits on oxides of nitrogen that will affect nine refineries and seven plants that produce asphalt, biofuel plants, hydrogen and sulfuric acid. Oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The gases can be produced by cars and industrial sources such as refineries and power plants. They are a key ingredient in producing ozone pollution. The new rules will reduce NOx emissions by about 8 tons per day over the next 14 years, with nearly half the reductions expected by 2023, and will go a long way to helping the region meet some federal air quality standards by 2031, the AQMD said. The rules apply to some 300 pieces of combustion equipment at the facilities, such as boilers and gas turbines. The rules, which will be implemented over a decade, provide two ways of meeting the new requirements and also ban refineries from purchasing credits to offset pollution they produce. The total cost of implementing the new rules is projected at about $2.3 billion, but the reduction in health costs from pollution is expected to be about $2.6 billion, according to a September AQMD study session.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two hyenas at the Denver Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases among the animals worldwide, a national veterinary lab announced Friday. Samples from a variety of animals at the zoo, including the spotted hyenas, were tested after several lions at the facility became ill, according to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The hyena samples tested presumptive positive at a lab at Colorado State University, and the cases were confirmed by the national lab. In addition to the two hyenas, 11 lions and two tigers at the zoo tested positive for the virus. “Hyenas are famously tough, resilient animals that are known to be highly tolerant to anthrax, rabies and distemper. They are otherwise healthy and expected to make a full recovery,” the zoo said in a statement. Zoo officials said the hyenas – 22-year-old Ngozi and 23-year-old Kibo – are experiencing mild symptoms, including slight lethargy, some nasal discharge and an occasional cough. The other animals that tested positive in recent weeks either have fully recovered or are on the path to a full recovery. “We now know that many other species may be susceptible to COVID-19 based on multiple reports, and we continue to use the highest level of care and precaution when working with all of our 3,000 animals and 450 different species,” the statement said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Bomb threats forced the evacuation of several buildings at Yale University as well as nearby businesses for hours Friday, school and city officials said. A single caller to the New Haven police nonemergency line indicated there were bombs in eight buildings on campus about 2 p.m., police and school officials said. People in the buildings were initially told to go to the New Haven Green. Later, they were directed to certain indoor locations. Yale gave the all clear at about 7 p.m. and said the campus had resumed normal operations. Several city streets were blocked off as law enforcement officials with bomb-sniffing dogs prepared to search the buildings that were threatened. FBI and state police were helping Yale and New Haven authorities in the investigation and response. “We’re treating this as if it is a legitimate threat; however, at this time we are still working on who the caller was,” acting New Haven Police Chief Renee Dominguez said at a late afternoon news conference. Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said the person who made the bomb threats did not give a reason.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The family-owned Delaware Park, home to the state’s biggest thoroughbred horse race each year, is being sold to a private equity firm and a gambling investor. The sale of Delaware Park, which has been operated by the Rickman family since the early 1980s and now includes a casino, should be completed by the end of the year, according to a news release Friday. The new owners will be Canadian-based Clairvest Group Inc. and Rubico Gaming LLC, a newly formed subsidiary run by investor Thomas Benninger. Delaware Park President Bill Fasy, who declined to comment Friday when asked about a sale price, said he wasn’t aware of any immediate operational changes to the Wilmington-based attraction, which hosts the Delaware Handicap each July. First developed by William du Pont Jr. in the 1930s, Delaware Park was known as the only major East Coast track, save for Aqueduct in New York, that raced in June. In 1983, longtime Maryland-based real estate developer William Rickman Sr. purchased the track, which had closed after financial troubles. He revived the business by offering smaller purses, which attracted cheaper horses. Competition improved in 1996 when legislation allowed slot machines at the track.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University’s president addressed students Friday as campus protests entered a 24th day Friday, WUSA-TV reports. Dozens of students began occupying the Blackburn University Center and set up tents on the yard in October to bring attention to several issues, including a demand for better living conditions, as they claim some dormitory rooms have been found to have mold. They also want student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees. “We’re not just these radical Black students,” said Channing Hill, a junior at Howard. “We’re simply trying to garner the first-class living conditions that Georgetown students have.” The day’s protests coincided with President Wayne Frederick’s annual State of the University address. Frederick took questions from students and alumni in a virtual event and said he was “empathetic with the students who have concerns.” He said one student with mold in their room is one too many, and Howard needs to make sure its housing partners who are responsible for the upkeep and cleaning air ducts are doing it at a high level. But Frederick also said dorms are not any worse now than they have been in the past. “The physical infrastructure of our residence halls today is as good as it’s ever been,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Reversing its previous position, the University of Florida said Friday that it will allow three professors to testify as experts in a lawsuit challenging a new state election law that critics say restricts voting rights. Last month, the university prohibited Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin from testifying in the lawsuit brought by civic groups, saying that such testimony would put the school in conflict with the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, which pushed the election law. More than half of the university’s trustees are appointed by the governor. In a letter to the campus, university President Kent Fuchs said he is asking the office responsible for approving professors’ outside work to greenlight their request to serve as expert witnesses in the litigation. Fuchs said the outside work would have to be on the professors’ own time and not use university resources. Attorneys representing the professors said they were still planning to move forward with a lawsuit against the university. The school’s announcement came after the union for faculty members urged donors to withhold contributions and scholars and artists to turn down invitations to campus until university administrators affirmed the free speech rights of school employees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republicans on Friday advanced a plan projected to maintain a 33-23 GOP majority in the state Senate, setting it up for a possible vote this week in the full Senate. The proposal passed the Senate Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee on a 9-4 party-line vote over complaints that Republicans pushed too fast for a proposal released late Tuesday. “This process has gone too fast,” said Sen. Harold Jones II, D-Augusta. “We should really know what we’re talking about.” As senators voted, a House committee started considering new districts for the 180-member state House. The General Assembly must redraw electoral districts at least once every decade to equalize populations following the U.S. census. Georgia added more than a million people from 2010 to 2020, with urban districts generally growing and rural districts usually shrinking. This will be the first time in decades that Georgia lawmakers won’t be required to get federal approval of their maps after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act. Committee Chairman John Kennedy, R-Macon, noted that this year’s redistricting process had been compressed because of delays in releasing census results. But he said that if people wanted different alternatives considered, they should have gotten their senators to introduce them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An independent review of the state of astronomy and astrophysics in the U.S. has recommended federal funding of a giant telescope in the state. The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey warned it could be “disastrous” for U.S. astronomy if the National Science Foundation does not invest in projects like the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The survey recommends the U.S. government fund several large astronomy projects. “There’s a little bit of a feeling of astronomy going the way of physics,” said Doug Simons, director of the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. He said the cancellation of a particle accelerator in Texas in 1993 resulted in the research moving to European facilities like the Large Hadron Collider. “I think if … the Europeans were the only international organization that had this kind of research capacity, that really signals something kind of alarming in the U.S., which has historically had a leadership role in contemporary astronomy.” But the report also highlights astronomy’s problems with Indigenous people. Some Native Hawaiians consider the proposed site for the giant telescope, on the Big Island’s Mauna Kea, to be sacred. “I wish they would have recognized that we have already spoken,” Native Hawaiian activist Kealoha Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch sent a letter to the White House last week requesting a meeting about Idaho’s federal district judge vacancy, saying it “cannot be filled” without a “mutual agreement” between them and the administration. But the “blue slip” procedure that the Republicans referenced – a system that gave home-state senators a veto over federal judicial nominees – was thrown out during the Trump administration, when federal judges were appointed over objections from Democratic senators. “The blue slip procedure regarding filling United States District Court vacancies is alive and well,” the two senators wrote in a Nov. 2 letter to Dana Remus, counsel to the president, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials submitted an all-female list of four nominees to the White House in March, but there’s been no further word on the nomination since then. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill took senior status in August, making Idaho eligible for another federal judge. The Democratics nominated Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Idaho is one of just three states with only two U.S. district judges and has not gotten an additional judgeship in 60 years, though caseloads have soared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools officials have canceled all classes next Friday in a bid to boost COVID-19 vaccinations among younger students who are newly eligible for the shots. A letter from the district sent Thursday to parents and families said schools will be closed Nov. 12 for “Vaccination Awareness Day” after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old last week. District CEO Pedro Martinez said next Friday’s canceled classes will provide “an opportunity for parents and guardians to take their children 5 years of age and older to get vaccinated.” He said sporting events would not be canceled. Martinez and Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady have stressed their desire to see children vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when family gatherings have proven to spread the coronavirus at high rates. Jesse Sharkey, the Chicago Teachers Union president, said in a statement to union members that he welcomes the district’s acknowledgment of the importance for parents and families to get their children vaccinated. Free vaccines can be obtained at sites around the city. In addition, CPS has set up four clinics where students can get shots. Appointments can be made at cps.edu/vaccinations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: With state tax collections surging, a top Republican legislator is looking at possible significant changes to the state sales tax and cutting property taxes for some businesses. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Tim Brown hasn’t offered details yet for what he could propose for the new legislative session starting in January, but such changes face concerns about the possibility of an economic slowdown and the impact on funding for local governments and school districts. Topics in Brown’s sights include expanding Indiana’s 7% sales tax that covers merchandise purchases ranging from clothing to cars so that it also is charged for spending on services, which potentially could be anything from haircuts to hospital stays. Brown said his aim would be to lower the sales tax rate if it were applied to a broader range of spending. Brown pointed to a trend of more spending on services, which federal reports show now make up nearly 70% of consumer spending. “Our sales tax base is changing a lot, so I am interested in looking at sales tax, and sales tax affects everybody,” Brown said. “It doesn’t matter how much money you make; you pay sales tax.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Twenty years after a fire destroyed the dome of the University of Iowa’s Old Capitol, the UI now is preparing to redo “failing” gilding at an estimated cost of $200,000 to $500,000. The UI will pay OPN Architects $23,500 to study the “causes and extents of gilding failure on the Old Capitol dome and develop recommendations for repair and restoration,” according to a contract signed in September. The study may include drone photography, sampling of the gold leaf and consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. Wendy Moorehead, UI assistant director of facilities management, said that “the campus is excited to celebrate the upcoming year representing the 175th anniversary of the UI, and the Old Capitol dome, at the heart of campus, will represent that important milestone.” Another major milestone was the Nov. 20, 2001, fire that destroyed the dome, damaged much of the historic building and kept the Old Capitol shuttered for five years. The Old Capitol Building, for which the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1840, was to be the hub of state government after Iowa City was chosen as the state capital in 1839. The Iowa Legislative Assembly met in the building for the first time in December 1842. The Legislature decided in 1857 to move the capital to Des Moines. Old Cap housed most of the UI classes after the university was founded in 1847. The building also served as the library, chapel, armory and office space for administrators.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly grew more forceful Friday in opposing President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates, saying it’s “too late” in the pandemic to impose them after Kansas and other states tailored responses to their needs. Kelly’s latest statement came a day after she argued that federal mandates “tend not to work,” though they’ve boosted vaccination rates elsewhere. She faces a difficult race for reelection next year in her Republican-leaning state, and GOP officials have been attacking the Democratic president’s mandates for weeks and criticizing Kelly for not making any public comments until Thursday. “While I appreciate the intention to keep people safe, a goal I share, I don’t believe this directive is the correct, or the most effective, solution for Kansas,” Kelly said in her latest statement. Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who hopes to unseat Kelly next year, announced later Friday that Kansas is among seven states that filed a federal lawsuit with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati against a Biden mandate that applies to companies with more than 100 workers. Schmidt already had brought Kansas into a federal lawsuit against a mandate applying to employees of federal government contractors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear, a Bluegrass State bourbon industry leader and a Louisville-based spirits producer are applauding an agreement between the United States and the European Union to lift tariffs on bourbon and whiskey. The United States and European Union have been in a trade war since 2018, when the former imposed a 25% tariff, or tax on imports, on European steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum under then-President Donald Trump. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on American products, including a 25% on bourbon whiskey. That tariff on a major Kentucky product was set to double Dec. 1. But now, for bourbon producers, “it’s time to raise a glass,” Kentucky Distillers Association President Eric Gregory said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced an agreement Oct. 30 in which the United States will allow some quantity of European steel and aluminum to come to the country without tariffs, and, in turn, the European Union will drop its retaliatory tariffs. Gregory said that “these unfortunate tariffs have slashed exports of Kentucky bourbon by 50% to the EU and the United Kingdom, costing distillers, industry partners and farm families hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nFranklin: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is holding a contest to name a recently improved pond in a national wildlife refuge. The agency has graded the parking lot and installed a floating dock and an information kiosk at the pond on Stephen R. Road in the Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge near Franklin. Now it’s asking people to visit the refuge and take a selfie or a photo of their family enjoying its trails as part of their entry. The photo, proposed name and a short explanation of the name can be submitted by email – bayouteche@fws.gov – or at facebook.com/SoutheastLouisiana. Specific personal names or vulgar, profane, racially insensitive or other derogatory names will not be accepted. The top five entries will be announced Dec. 2 on the refuge’s Facebook page, and the public will have a week to choose their favorite. The winning name will be announced live on Facebook at 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 11.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s environmental commissioner said Friday that she’ll take the referendum vote into account when deciding whether to suspend a permit for a $1 billion electric transmission line in western Maine. Commissioner Melanie Loyzim will close comments at the end of a new public hearing Nov. 22 so she can expedite a decision. Loyzim’s letter to New England Clean Energy Connect points to an aggressive timetable after Maine residents voted Tuesday to halt the project. The law takes effect 30 days after election results are certified. The Natural Resources Council of Maine told the commissioner the permit should be revoked immediately to prevent further environmental damage during construction, which is continuing. It would be a “dereliction of duty” for regulators to allow “continued destruction” of woodlands while waiting for the law to go into effect, James Kilbreth, a lawyer for NRCM, wrote Thursday in a notice to environmental regulators. The 145-mile power transmission line would serve as a conduit for up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower. Most of it would be built along existing corridors, but a new 53-mile section is being cut through the woods to reach the Canadian border.\n\nMaryland\n\nElkton: The Christmas tree that will light up Rockefeller Center this holiday season is coming from Maryland for the first time in the nearly nine decades of the annual tradition. A 79-foot-tall Norway spruce will be cut down in Elkton next Thursday and arrive in New York City on Saturday, the center announced Thursday. Rockefeller Center’s website says the 85-year-old tree will be covered with about 5 miles of wire holding more than 50,000 multicolored lights and topped with a 900-pound star covered in 3 million Swarovski crystals. The lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 1 and will be televised on NBC. After that, the tree will be lit daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Day and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Three residents of a tent encampment at the nexus of the city’s opioid and homelessness crises say in a lawsuit that Boston’s plan to move them from the area is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide viable alternatives, officials said Friday. The lawsuit filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and the WilmerHale law firm was in response to the city’s decision last month to declare addiction and homelessness a public health emergency and clean up the area around Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, known as Mass and Cass. The city pledged to find treatment or alternative housing for people displaced from tents in the area but has not properly done so, according to the ACLU. Although only three plaintiffs are mentioned, the suit applies to all residents of the area, according to the ACLU. “We can’t sweep or arrest our way out of the intersecting crises at Mass and Cass,” Carol Rose, the state ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement. “This plan is harmful and unconstitutional because it forces people to disperse with no safe place to sleep, while disconnecting them from the medical care they are able to receive at Mass and Cass.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-backed bills that would have created scholarship accounts for K-12 students to pay for educational expenses, including private school and tutoring, and given tax credits to people and corporations that donate to the program. The veto, which was expected, came the same week proponents of the legislation preemptively launched a ballot drive that would enable the GOP-led Legislature to enact identical citizen-initiated bills without her signature. The Democratic governor said the bills would cut state revenue by as much as $500 million in 2022 alone. “Simply put, our schools cannot provide the high-quality education our kids deserve if we turn private schools into tax shelters for the wealthy,” she wrote to lawmakers, adding that she has worked to reverse disinvestment in public education. School-choice proponents such as the Great Lakes Education Project criticized Whitmer, saying the funds would have helped more than 1 million kids who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the plan, students would have been eligible for scholarships if their family income was no more than double the cutoff to receive free or reduced-priced lunch – $98,050 for a family of four currently – or if they had a disability or were in foster care.\n\nMinnesota\n\nPine City: Gov. Tim Walz was among the thousands of hunters who took to the field Saturday for the state’s firearms deer hunting season opener. Walz hunted with Brady Crocker and Kevin Hinze on the Hinze family’s private property in Pine County. The family permanently protected the land by donating a conservation easement to the Minnesota Land Trust. Walz, Crocker and Hinze didn’t get a deer, but the opener was marked by beautiful, warmer-than-usual weather across most of Minnesota. Following the hunt, Walz visited a chronic wasting disease sampling site in Pine City, joined by Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen and Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. They highlighted the importance of sampling to detect the brain disease, which is always fatal in deer. During opening weekend, people hunting in CWD surveillance, control, or management zones must bring their harvested deer to sampling stations to be tested. Voluntary sampling is available after the opening weekend for deer harvested within a CWD zone. “I ask all Minnesota deer hunters to be aware of CWD regulations and use one of the state’s sampling sites if hunting in a mandatory or voluntary sampling area,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An environmental group is using fines from the 2010 BP oil spill to plan the state’s first oyster shell recycling program. “It’s very straightforward – take the actual oyster shell and reuse it to help restore the very resource it’s providing. But the devil is always in the details,” said Alex Littlejohn, state director for The Nature Conservancy. “We want to learn from the other successful programs like this in other states, work through the kinks and make this a viable program for Mississippi.” At least 14 other states have had programs that collect empty shells from restaurants, festivals and other venues and use them to build coastal reefs. A survey before the COVID-19 pandemic found such programs in all four other Gulf Coast states, nine on the East Coast, and California, said Tom Mohrman, The Nature Conservancy’s director of marine programs. The programs often cover specific areas, such as Galveston Bay or Mobile Bay, but Mississippi’s coastline is small enough that one program could cover it all, he said. Mississippi’s Gulf Coast generally has plenty of oyster larvae but needs more hard surfaces where they can attach themselves and grow into oysters, the organization said in a news release. Oyster reefs also create homes for other types of marine life, slow waves that erode coastlines, and purify water.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter to President Joe Biden and members of Congress that employees at a federal office complex in the city were exposed to “widespread, longstanding” contamination from asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic materials by the agency in charge of managing government workplaces. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the letter, issued Friday, also noted that children at an on-site day care facility were exposed. The letter said officials deliberately misled tenants about the health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel handles investigations and prosecution aimed at protecting federal employees. The OSC said an investigation into whistleblower allegations “substantiated that officials had been aware of environmental contamination but failed to appropriately notify GSA employees or tenant agencies.” The investigation also concluded that officials made no effort to limit access to contaminated areas and failed to assess potential exposure risks in the site’s child care center. The GSA has said it is working to close the Goodfellow complex and expects to relocate most tenant agencies by the end of 2022.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Calls to the Missoula Mobile Support Team have significantly reduced the number of people who would otherwise be taken to jail or to an emergency room since the team’s inception late last year, according to a presentation the program’s organizers made to a City Council committee Wednesday. Data shows that calls to the team are also on the rise. “The number of calls increased over time and continue to increase,” Gretchen Neal, Missoula County’s mental health coordinator, told the Missoulian. The Mobile Support Team is funded by the county, the city and the state. Emergency medical technicians from the Missoula Fire Department and licensed behavioral health clinicians or clinicians in training work with case facilitators to staff the team. They are trained to provide consultation, screening and brief intervention to individuals in crisis stemming from behavioral health issues, which includes mental health issues or substance abuse issues. The goal is to provide them with the care they need while reducing the time that first responders spend addressing a situation in which behavioral health is the chief concern. Another goal is to reduce the number of arrests and emergency room visits, which reduces government-funded jail and hospital costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city plans to join hundreds of others across the nation trying to come up with strategies to combat climate change. While the Nebraska Legislature has rejected calls for a statewide plan, Omaha will lead a metropolitan area climate action plan expected to be funded with a mix of public and private money, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert told the newspaper in an email that the time is right. “Omaha has been implementing sustainability measures for some time now without the need for a formal plan,” she wrote. “The current timeline gives us the opportunity to maximize the results of more coordination for climate-related practices.” Climate plans typically involve identifying where a community is most vulnerable to severe weather, its contribution to global warming, what needs to be done and measurable steps that can be taken. A consultant is expected to be chosen by mid-2022. It could take a year or longer for the consultant that’s chosen to develop the plan. Some wonder what took so long. The Kansas City metropolitan area, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and Lincoln are among nearby places that already have climate action plans. “Omaha and the surrounding area are late to the solutions game,” said David Corbin, chairman of the Missouri Valley Sierra Club’s energy committee.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: American Civil Liberties Union attorneys said if the state redraws its political maps without reallocating thousands of inmates to their pre-prison addresses, they will be in violation of a 2019 Nevada law. The threat of a lawsuit and the organization’s insistence that prison officials compile more addresses could complicate the redistricting process that lawmakers are expected to conduct this month. Though the U.S. census counts inmates at prisons where they’re serving sentences, Nevada is one of a growing number of states required to reallocate residents in prison to where they previously lived. Nevada lawmakers in 2019 passed legislation to ban so-called prison gerrymandering. It directs the Department of Corrections to “compile the last known residential address of each offender immediately before the offender was sentenced to imprisonment in a facility or institution of the Department” and subsequently “provide to the State Demographer all available information.” Last week, prison officials said they only had usable addresses for 6,275 people out of the 12,214 counted in the 2020 census, or about 51%. In a Friday letter sent to lawmakers and state officials, attorneys Holly Welborn and Chris Peterson allege the thousands of missing inmate addresses “place the Legislature at risk of violating Nevada’s Constitutional requirement to base reapportionment on accurate data.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: A 9-foot-tall video game joystick made of wood, rubber and steel has made it into the Guinness World Records 2022 as the largest. Dartmouth College professor Mary Flanagan created the giant controller – nearly 14 times the size of an original classic Atari controller – in 2006 to celebrate her childhood experience of “maniacally” playing Atari 2600 video games. She also wanted to see what it would be like when a single-player experience becomes collaborative: It takes at least two people to operate the joystick and push the button to play classic Atari games such as “Centipede” and “Breakout.” “To have this common pop culture artifact just erupt in the middle of a space and allow people to play something familiar, yet not familiar, was exciting,” said Flanagan, an artist who is chair of Dartmouth’s Film and Media Studies and the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities. The joystick, which toured Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, is now part of the permanent collection of ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A truck driver who ousted the powerful state Senate president in last week’s election previously posted online calling Islam “a false religion,” comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and defending rioters at the U.S. Capitol. Republican Edward Durr apologized Friday after media outlets highlighted the posts. His victory over Steve Sweeney, widely regarded as the second most powerful Democrat in state government, in Tuesday’s election shocked the state’s political establishment. Durr spent a paltry sum on his campaign. On Thursday and Friday, media reports highlighted posts Durr had made on Twitter and Facebook, including some critical of immigrants, boasting of defying state COVID-19 mask mandates, and making misogynist attacks on Democratic elected officials like then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Durr issued a statement Thursday night to radio station WHYY and Friday to the website New Jersey Globe apologizing for the posts. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment,” Durr said in identical comments to both outlets. “If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize.” Twitter showed Friday that Durr’s account had been deactivated by the user.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials have been inundated with critical letters on proposed K-12 social studies standards over the inclusion of racial identity and social justice themes in a majority-Latino state where Indigenous tribes have persevered through war, famine, internment camps and boarding schools aimed at stamping out their cultures. If approved, the standards would require students starting in kindergarten to “identify some of their group identities” and “take group or individual action to help address local, regional, and/or global problems.” By high school, students would examine “factors which resulted in unequal power relations among identity groups.” Critics, including some Hispanics, say the standards promote victimhood, while supporters have praised the standards as “more just and anti-racist.” The proposed New Mexico standards represent a new frontier in the clash over “critical race theory” – an academic concept increasingly used by conservative activists as a catchall term for the study of systemic racism, historical oppression or progressive social activism. New Mexico is a patchwork of 23 federally recognized Native American nations, tribes and pueblos. Half of the state is Latino, and about 10% of students are Native American, with many tracing their heritage to pre-Columbian and 16th-century Spanish conquistadors.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former head of the city’s police sergeants union has been punished with a loss of 70 vacation days, which amounts to almost $32,000 in pay, after being found guilty by his own police department of improperly disclosing information and using inappropriate language on social media, police said Friday. Ed Mullins of the New York Police Department had already filed retirement papers last month and retired as president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in the wake of federal agents raiding the union’s office and his home. The retirement was effective as of Friday, but the NYPD said in an email that “the cases were moved forward expeditiously to ensure the appropriate penalty could be imposed in the event of findings of guilt.” Mullins was found guilty in disciplinary proceedings for improperly tweeting NYPD paperwork last year regarding the arrest of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s daughter during protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. He denied violating guidelines. In a separate complaint from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he was also found guilty after an administrative hearing for using inappropriate language in social media posts he made that referenced other New York City officials. Review board Chair Fred Davie said he was “disappointed” that Mullins was docked vacations days and not fired.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Barely 24 hours after their passage, the state’s newly drawn maps drew another legal complaint that will likely determine how much Republicans can expand their political clout over the coming decade in a state that is slowly becoming more blue. An organization formed by Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer, announced Friday that a group of voters who successfully challenged previous North Carolina maps will now make a similar appeal in state court contesting the latest congressional maps. They will argue that the boundaries approved by Republicans on Thursday were drawn for political gain in a way that violates several provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. The stakes are high, as Republicans currently hold an 8-5 edge over Democrats in the U.S. House and would likely expand their advantages substantially if the maps prevail. During a virtual event on Twitter, Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, called North Carolina’s maps “a grotesque partisan gerrymander” and “indefensible.” “The Republican Party has lost all shame,” Elias said. “I mean, in the 2010 (redistricting process and) after 2010, they were still pretending that they cared about democracy and about voting rights, and now they no longer pretend.” Last week, voters and advocacy groups sued in Wake County court to block the timetable for passing state legislative maps, accusing Republicans of breaking rules aimed at ensuring Black voters can elect their desired candidates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A proposal to use $150 million in federal stimulus money to build another pipeline to carry natural gas from the Bakken region to eastern North Dakota will be on the table as lawmakers convene at the Capitol. Lawmakers plan to divvy up $1 billion from the federal American Rescue Plan Act during the special session, which opens Monday, and the money that leaders hope to set aside for pipeline grants could make the prospect of such a project more attractive to developers. “There’s been a long-standing desire to see more North Dakota gas be used in the state,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad told the Bismarck Tribune. The Bakken region of western North Dakota produces substantial quantities of gas alongside oil, and some of it is wastefully burned off in flares at well sites rather than piped away for use as fuel due to a lack of infrastructure. Some eastern North Dakota communities have gas service because they happen to be near a limited number of pipelines that extend to that part of the state, but many do not. Much of the gas produced within North Dakota is transported to markets in other states. Cost appears to be the major barrier to building another pipeline. The economics tend to work out better to send gas down existing pipelines into other states, Kringstad said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The election board for the state’s most populous county is being put under administrative oversight by the secretary of state, after another problem with electronic poll books led to three improperly cast votes in last week’s election. Not all of Franklin County’s electronic poll books were properly updated on Election Day with data about who had already voted early or requested an absentee ballot, according to Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office. His office has determined three voters were able to vote twice but said those votes didn’t affect the outcome of any election. One of those voters told the office they cast a ballot during early voting, then did so again on Election Day while accompanying their spouse to vote because a poll worker indicated the poll book didn’t reflect the earlier vote. The voter said they were worried their first ballot hadn’t been counted. The Franklin County Board of Elections had another problem last year with some of its electronic poll books not updating, and it didn’t fully follow a remediation plan to avoid the newest problem, LaRose’s office said. To make sure the board is effectively administering elections, it will now have to report weekly to the secretary of state, according to LaRose’s office.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group of about 20 local pastors and ministers gathered outside the state Capitol on Friday to pray for Gov. Kevin Stitt as he weighs the fate of high-profile death row inmate Julius Jones. The preachers said they hoped Stitt would lean heavily on his Christian roots and follow the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation that Jones be granted clemency. “Lord, we implore you to allow Gov. Stitt to be the hero of Julius’ story,” the Rev. Keith Jossell, Jones’ spiritual adviser, said in his prayer. The prayer gathering came only days before Jones’ execution date, set for Nov. 18. Jones was convicted in 2002 in the fatal shooting of Edmond insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking. Jones has maintained his innocence in the murder, claiming another individual shot and killed Howell and pinned the slaying on him. The Rev. Major Jemison, senior pastor of St. John Missionary Baptist Church, said the circumstances surrounding Jones’ conviction included Jones’ lack of adequate representation, lack of fairness and lack of equality. Jemison also voiced unease that there could be negative consequences should the governor go against the parole board’s recommendation. “We are also very concerned about the potential for civil unrest if the state proceeds with the execution of Mr. Jones while disregarding the avalanche of questions and ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of the case,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: The teachers union in the city has filed a lawsuit over a policy passed narrowly by its school board that limits what kinds of images or signs school employees can display on campus. The “Ensuring Safe Environments to Learn” policy bars school employees from displaying images “relating to a political, quasi-political, or controversial topic.” The lawsuit was filed Wednesday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Newberg policy has been a lightning rod for controversy, with the ACLU, Democrats in the Oregon Legislature and the State Board of Education all issuing statements against it. The policy, backed by a four-member majority of the Newberg school board, started out as a directive to remove signs and posters showing support for Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. In its 18-page complaint, the Newberg Education Association argues the policy violates two amendments of the U.S. Constitution: the First Amendment protecting free speech and the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection. The suit also argues the Newberg policy violates Article I, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution, which protects “against vague laws that confer unbridled discretion, because such discretion creates the potential for unequal application of the law,” among other state constitutional provisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said his mail-in ballot was dropped off by his wife before Tuesday’s election despite a state law requiring that voters deliver them in person. Wolf’s spokeswoman Beth Rementer called it an honest mistake. “I did vote; actually I voted by mail,” Wolf said Tuesday on KDKA radio. When an interviewer told him the ballot was due in the York County elections office by the end of Election Day, he said first lady Frances Wolf delivered it. “My wife actually dropped it off personally two weeks ago, so it’s there,” he said. The interview segment was highlighted Thursday in a tweet by state Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County, who has spent much of the past year working on an election code revamp. In June, Democrat Wolf vetoed an election reform bill Grove sponsored. “It’s law,” Grove said in a text exchange Thursday. “You can’t hand in more than 1 ballot.” He said Frances Wolf dropping off the governor’s mail-in ballot would have been legal had his bill been enacted. State law requires voters who do not mail their absentee or mail-in ballot to “deliver it in person to (their) county board of election,” although with preapproval others can do it under certain circumstances.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A World War I veteran is getting a new monument in the city after the original monument in his honor was vandalized. City Councilman David Salvatore said the new marker in honor of Pfc. Carlo Lafazia will be commissioned and dedicated next spring. “We’re going to relocate it to a new area that is going to allow for an education opportunity, first and foremost about the history of Private Lafazia and the contributions that he made, and secondly, some of the history around World War I and what that meant to the Eagle Park community and to Rhode Island as a whole,” Salvatore said. Lafazia, who served in the 16th Infantry Regiment, was killed in the Forest of Argonne in France in October 1918. The original monument was placed on Admiral Street in 2017. But earlier this year, it was knocked off its foundation. The vandal was never caught. The damaged monument stone is now stored at the Department of Public Works.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A strong storm off the Southeast’s Atlantic coast combined with periodic higher tides Sunday, causing coastal flooding that approached levels rarely seen outside of hurricanes along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts, officials said. Scientists have said data shows the unusually high tides and the flooding of roads that come with it are happening more frequently as sea levels rise with global warming. The Sunday high tide in Charleston Harbor reached 8.51 feet, the 10th-highest level in the century of recording at that site, the National Weather Service said. The high water closed dozens of roads in downtown and caused the city to cancel its Veterans Day parade scheduled for Saturday. Sunday’s high tides were the culmination of four days of rising ocean water pushed ashore by both winds from a strong autumn storm offshore and periodic King Tides when the moon’s location causes the water level to increase. Rising sea levels are leading to more frequent flooding, meteorologists said. Charleston Harbor has recorded 25 of the 39 tides of 8 feet or greater since 2015. The tide reached that level for major flooding three times already this month, meteorologists said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A moose on the loose got onto the South Dakota State University football field in Brookings before leaving town. Campus police said the moose left campus about 3:30 p.m. Friday and was headed west. They said the bull moose appeared to be 1 to 2 years old. Emmett Keyser, the regional supervisor for the Game Fish and Parks office, told KELO-TV his agency helped the campus police and other law enforcement with herding the moose out of town. “We did try to move him north,” Keyser said. But, in apparent impersonation of a running back, “he ran back through our line and into the stadium,” Keyser said. The moose hung around campus for a time until officials were able to herd him west out of town. “The thing is, moose are so unpredictable,” Keyser said. “You don’t want anyone getting hurt or the animal getting hurt.” The sighting followed one a few days earlier of a moose walking down U.S. Highway 75 in Luverne, Minnesota, about 50 miles away. It wasn’t clear if it was the same moose. While moose are rare in the area, they do appear from time to time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Friday again extended an executive order that allows parents to opt students out of school mask requirements that federal judges have blocked from applying in three counties. The Republican’s decision maintains the status quo on the opt-out order for two weeks while he considers whether to sign a broad coronavirus-related bill that would limit mask policies in schools even further. He first issued the mask opt-out order in mid-August and extended it in late September. Lee on Friday also extended the ongoing state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic until Nov. 19, while members of his administration “continue analyzing impacts of recent legislation & how it affects certain provisions,” he wrote on Twitter. During their recent three-day special session, Republican lawmakers passed a proposal that would in part largely prohibit government entities – including public schools – from implementing mask mandates. Those entities would only be allowed to require masks if they lived in a county with a rolling average 14-day COVID-19 infection rate of at least 1,000 per 100,000 resident while the state is under a state of emergency. There are no counties that currently meet that threshold. Even then, mask mandates would continue to be limited in use.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The weeklong, record-breaking February freeze this past winter led to crises of power, water, food, shelter, medical care, transportation and emergency response. A lengthy report published by the city Thursday identified a myriad of issues the community experienced that week and offered 132 recommendations about how to be better prepared for the next disaster. The freeze “was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading community impacts,” says the report, written by the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management departments with the help of Hagerty Consulting. The report reviewed the city’s entire response to the weather event and subsequent crises, identifying lapses in training and coordination, as well as supply-chain failures and neglected communities. “City and county leadership sought to move expeditiously to provide life-sustaining services,” the report says. “These included activation of shelter and warming centers, coordinating medical operations and distribution of drinking water. They faced significant obstacles in loss of infrastructure, staffing shortfalls, and availability of volunteers.” The coronavirus pandemic meant resources were already stretched thin, the report says. Some elected officials and volunteers set up services in response to shortfalls in departmental services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers are set to vote on a name change for southern Utah’s Dixie State University this week. A bill to rename it Utah Technical University will be considered in a special session in which lawmakers will also vote on redistricting, state Rep. Kelly Miles, R-South Ogden, told Fox13. It’s expected to get a hearing before the Education Interim Committee on Tuesday. The step comes after numerous public hearings, focus groups and a vote in favor of a name change from the Utah System of Higher Education. Supporters of changing “Dixie” have pointed to difficulties in recruiting and retaining students, who link the name to the South, the Civil War and the Confederacy. Past yearbooks show students in blackface, Confederate flags and the former mascot dubbed “The Rebel.” Opponents of the name change insist the name comes from Mormon pioneers who settled in the St. George area to grow cotton. They’ve begun launching campaigns to pressure lawmakers to resist a name change, accusing the state of giving in to “cancel culture.” The Washington County Commission recently passed a resolution supporting \\\\ the “Dixie” name. But Miles said that after an extensive input-gathering process, he expects the Legislature to support a name change. Gov. Spencer Cox would also be expected to sign it.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is requiring unvaccinated employees to use personal sick time if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19 through their jobs and have to quarantine. State workers who exhaust all their sick time could be required to quarantine without being paid. Fully vaccinated employees forced to quarantine will be paid without needing to use sick time. “We want to do whatever we can to take advantage of safe, effective and free vaccines,” Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Phil Scott, said Friday. “If there are people who choose not to, there are implications to making that decision.” Maulucci said it was unclear how many people have had to use sick leave or if anyone has already gone unpaid. Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, said there have been cases in which employees have had to use leave, but he didn’t have a specific number. He didn’t know if anyone had gone without pay. Howard said the union has filed a grievance, saying the new policy was implemented without working through the details with the union. The previous policy allowed state workers who had to quarantine to be paid while out of work.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A juvenile son of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin tried twice to cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election, election officials said Friday. The 17-year-old presented an ID but was told he was ineligible to vote due to his age and turned away, according to a statement from Scott Konopasek, Fairfax County’s general registrar. The statement said the teen did not successfully vote, made no false statements, did not disrupt voting and appeared to have committed “no election offense.” The statement mentioned Youngkin’s son by name, saying the identification was based on contemporaneous notes by the chief election officer. The news was first reported by The Washington Post. The Associated Press is not naming the son because he is a juvenile. A spokesman for the Republican governor-elect, who campaigned heavily on election integrity, said the son misunderstood Virginia’s laws. State law allows any person who is 17 and will be 18 by Election Day to register in advance and vote in any intervening primary or special election. Jennifer Chanty, a precinct captain, told The Washington Post she encountered the son, who left after initially being told he was too young to vote. She said he returned a short time later, saying a friend who was also 17 had been allowed to cast a ballot. Youngkin, who has four children, made election integrity central to his campaign during the fight for the GOP nomination, and he refused for months to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Three Black women who work for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department have filed a lawsuit against the county alleging a long-standing pattern of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against minority employees. The News Tribune reports Lt. Charla James-Hutchison and Sgts. Dione Alexander and Sabrina Braswell-Bouyer are the highest-ranking African American women in the department’s 168-year history. Their attorneys filed the suit on their behalf last Monday, claiming that the women – who all work in Pierce County Jail – have suffered emotional distress, economic losses and damage to their reputations due to the decades of discrimination. No specific damages are specified in the lawsuit. James-Hutchison, Alexander and Braswell-Bouyer are among 12 Black women who work for the Sheriff’s Department, according to county statistics. There are 47 Black sworn employees in the department out of about 614. The women have been subjected to racial slurs, told they were only hired or promoted to “fill a quota,” called thugs because of their hairstyles, and subjected to colleagues’ comments about how the COVID-19 vaccines should be tested on Black people before white people, the suit says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren ages 5 to 11 can receive a $150 school voucher if they are vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday. The program is through the Healthy Grandfamilies vaccination incentive program. To receive a voucher, the family must be enrolled in West Virginia State University’s Healthy Grandfamilies program at healthygrandfamilies.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended the vaccine for use by children ages 5 to 11. All vaccine-eligible members of the family must have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vouchers can be used for school supplies, the governor’s office said in a news release. About 19,000 West Virginia children live in households with a grandparent as primary caregiver, according to the Healthy Grandfamilies organization.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison has raised the Ho-Chunk Nation flag over its main administration building, marking the first time the university has flown another nation’s flag with the U.S. flag and the Wisconsin flag. Friday’s ceremony at Bascom Hall felt historic to senior Paige Skenandore, who grew up on a reservation in northern Wisconsin and is one of roughly 100 Native American students on campus. It also felt long overdue. “I think this is a great first step,” Skenandore told the Wisconsin State Journal. “It’s been a long time coming. It’s kind of shocking that it hasn’t happened before.” Ho-Chunk Nation Chief Clayton Winneshiek told attendees the flag-raising was “a start.” UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the flag-raising was more than a symbolic gesture but part of an ongoing commitment to educate and acknowledge the state’s tribes and their sovereignty. Almost 190 years ago, the U.S. government and Ho-Chunk Nation signed the Treaty of 1832, which forced the tribe to give up territory that includes the UW-Madison campus. “For many years, UW-Madison was not mindful of this history, and we paid little attention to our relationship with the descendants of those who were here long before us,” Blank told a crowd of at least a couple hundred. “But we are working to change that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nTorrington: An inmate who died Wednesday is the fourth death in as many weeks at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. The Casper Star Tribune reports 66-year-old Frank Lee Apodaca died Wednesday at the Community Hospital in Torrington. The Wyoming Department of Corrections said it will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Apodaca was from Fort Collins, Colorado, and sentenced to nine to 12 years in prison in 2017, after being convicted of third-degree sexual assault and intrusion on a victim under age 16 in Laramie County.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/07/anti-pipeline-push-lynyrd-skynyrd-gopher-frogs-news-around-states/118674524/", "title": "Anti-pipeline push, Lynyrd Skynyrd: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/01/lifeguard-death-traffic-ticket-scam-amherst-pushback-news-around-states/118519764/", "title": "Lifeguard death, traffic ticket scam: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Rural school districts are leading the state in reported COVID-19 case rates. When the Alabama Department of Public Health updated its COVID-19 school dashboard for the first time this school year Friday, three districts stood out with the highest percentage of confirmed cases: Covington, Greene and Marion county schools. All three are rural districts, and about 5% of students in each district have tested positive for the coronavirus. These schools were among only 52 of Alabama’s 137 school districts with available data on the state dashboard. In Marion, most of the 160 reported cases were concentrated in three schools, resulting in temporary closures, said Marion County Superintendent Ann West. “We’re just trying to operate with what’s best for each school,” West said. “I don’t like to send children home because for some of our students, what they get to eat is at school.” Masks are not required in Marion County Schools, but West said the district strongly encourages them. “Certainly, if I were not vaccinated, I would be wearing a mask,” she said. Meanwhile, masks are required in Greene County Schools, which reported 47 COVID-19 cases Friday. Covington County Schools reported 140 cases. According to district protocols, masks are “recommended for all individuals while indoors” and required on school buses.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Assembly has authorized a 20-year lease of land to an Alaska Native corporation for development for cruise ship passengers. The Assembly, voting 5-2, approved leasing 17 acres to Shee Atika Inc., which plans to work with another company, Adventure Sitka, to develop the land with attractions such as zip lines, a salmon bake and a canoe launch, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The land is between the ferry terminal and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Chris McGraw, who owns the terminal and manages Adventure Sitka, said development of the property will be an important part of handling an expected large number of tourists. “The key to over-tourism is good distribution of guests,” McGraw said at an Assembly meeting. Karl Potts, CEO of Shee Atika Inc., said the lease would generate $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the city. Assembly member Kevin Knox raised questions about staffing at the site, citing difficulties businesses are having this year with hiring staff. But he said he would vote “yes” because of an expected influx of passengers next year. “We don’t have a lot of options here,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The FBI’s Public Corruption unit is investigating efforts by Gov. Doug Ducey’s past and current staffers – including one who is now a federal judge – to push for a closed-door deal to issue tax refunds worth as much as $100million to aid one of Ducey’s campaign supporters. Grant Nulle, former deputy director at the Department of Revenue, said an FBI agent contacted him in mid-July, shortly after an Arizona Republic investigation uncovered how the Ducey administration had pushed the department to agree to refund sales taxes on fuel for mining companies, even though that tax had been in place for decades. The companies that stood to benefit were represented by Texas tax firm Ryan LLC, founded by Ducey supporter G. Brint Ryan. The top three deputies in Ducey’s administration left their government jobs and went to work for Ryan to push for the tax refund. The men and others working for Ducey met with Revenue officials at least 16 times to insist that the department – which was under their oversight in the governor’s office – agree to stop opposing Ryan and issue a tax refund to one fuel company. That, officials said, would have triggered refunds in all other similar cases, costing the state’s general fund more than $100 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator climbed to a new high Monday as the state reported 33 new coronavirus deaths amid the summer surge driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The Department of Health reported the state’s COVID-19 patients on ventilators rose by 17 to 361, surpassing the high the state had set last week. The state’s virus hospitalizations remained unchanged from a day earlier at 1,257. There are 533 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state. The department reported there are 21 available ICU beds in Arkansas, though it’s not clear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients. Last week the state ran out of ICU beds for virus patients, though availability has slightly eased since then. The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose Monday to 6,912 since the pandemic began. It also added 882 new virus cases. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Department of Health reported that the number of active cases among students and staff in the state’s public schools has grown to 3,684. Cabot, Fort Smith, Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville schools each reported more than 100 active cases.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature on Monday voted to guarantee people can call out their bosses publicly in most harassment and discrimination cases. When companies settle complaints filed by their employees, the agreements often include a provision barring the employee from disparaging the company or talking publicly about what happened. These agreements came under fire during the #MeToo movement, criticized as shielding public figures and companies from responsibility in sexual harassment cases. California passed a law in 2018 that bans these nondisclosure agreements in cases involving sexual harassment, discrimination or assault. The Democratic-dominated Legislature voted Monday to expand that law to include other types of harassment and discrimination, including claims based on race, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether to sign it into law. “No worker should ever be silenced from speaking out about their own experience of harassment or discrimination in the workplace,” said Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, author of the bill. “For far too long, these secret settlements and agreements have reinforced a culture of secrecy that prevents accountability, respect and justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A former police officer involved in the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia should stand trial for assault, a judge ruled Monday. District Judge Michelle Brinegar said there is probable cause for the charge against former Loveland police Officer Austin Hopp, who will be arraigned in late September, the Loveland Reporter-Herald reports. Hopp arrested Karen Garner in June 2020 after she left a store without paying for about $14 worth of items. His body camera footage shows him catching up to the woman as she walks through a field along a road. Gardner, now 74, shrugs and turns away from him, and he quickly grabs her arm and pushes her 80-pound body to the ground. A federal lawsuit filed on Garner’s behalf, which included images from the body camera footage, claims that Hopp dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of his patrol car and that she was denied medical treatment for about six hours. Former Loveland police Officer Daria Jalali is facing several charges stemming from the arrest, including failing to intervene in the use of excessive force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 1,500 long-term unemployed residents who recently found jobs are being awarded $1,000 bonuses under the first round of the Back to Work CT program, an initiative funded with federal COVID-19 relief funds. Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants through Dec. 31. “Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday in a statement. “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare.” To be eligible for the program, applicants must obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and Dec. 31. Applicants must complete and submit an application electronically to the Department of Revenue Services.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A state trooper who received several traffic commendations has been indicted for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme in which at least two of his victims were fellow law enforcement officers, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Delaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the justice department, after an internal review found “a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings” by Ramirez. The review began April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez was immediately suspended. According to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez’s activity and compared instances in which E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what had been issued. In April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the justice department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings. In other instances, a traffic stop never happened.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Landon Collins, safety for the Washington Football Team, took some time away from the field Monday to bring joy to young football players, WUSA-TV reports. Collins surprised players at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation’s Woodbridge Warriors Youth Football Team at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Northeast D.C. Each member of the team got a $150 Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card to use however they wanted. Collins served as their personal shopping consultant. The kids, surprised and excited to spend time with the star player, grabbed new shoes and other football gear. “It just feels great for him to come down here and spend his time with us, just so we can have a surprise and get us ready,” one player said Collins said the opportunity to spend time with the kids was a blessing. “Being around these kids to give them a smile on their face and to put something on their shoulders that they can use on and off the football field is amazing,” Collins said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials on Monday began to make good on threats to withhold funding from school districts that defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates, despite a circuit judge last week ruling the ban unconstitutional. Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld an amount equal to monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward counties, as directed by the State Board of Education. Funds will continue to be withheld until the districts comply, Corcoran said. Broward County Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said in a statement that Broward County School Board believes it is in compliance with the law. “The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities,” Cartwright said. “As such, BCPS (Broward County Public Schools) will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools.” DeSantis, a Republican who is eyeing a possible presidential run in 2024, had been threatening to impose financial penalties on school boards for weeks. Democratic President Joe Biden has said if that happened, federal money would be used to cover any costs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers will use the same guidelines as in 2010 to redraw congressional, legislative and other electoral districts, meaning lawmakers are not required to give members of the public an advance look at the plans, nor consider whether districts give candidates from different political parties a meaningful chance to win. Identical guidelines were presented to both House and Senate redistricting committees Monday. The House voted to adopt the guidelines, while senators gave preliminary agreement, with a final vote likely on the first day of a special session expected in October or November. Asked about whether maps would be released in advance, Senate Majority Leader John Kennedy emphasized the shortened time period because of delays in U.S. census data stemming from COVID-19. In 2010, state legislative maps were unveiled the Friday before the redistricting special session began. “We’re obviously operating under a very short period of time compared to what they had to this previously,” said Kennedy, R-Macon. Advance notice of maps is one of the key objectives for which outside groups have been lobbying. “Georgians need to have access to the maps and know how and when the maps will be presented,” said Jerry Gonzalez, CEO of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials are concerned about a shortage of oxygen as the state’s coronavirus surge continues to grow. Hospital officials are canceling nonemergency procedures that require oxygen in an attempt to conserve supplies, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There is a global shortage of oxygen containers that are needed for transport to the islands, said Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a trade group for the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “The combined demand has increased to the point where we are concerned about whether we can generate enough oxygen in Hawaii to meet all the needs of our health care facilities,” Raethel said. Hawaii’s two oxygen plants have switched to producing medical gas only. Raethel said mainland tank orders are backlogged for months. Hawaii Pacific Health, which oversees several hospitals in the state, directed staff to cancel elective procedures where oxygen is needed. “We do not plan to defer any emergency surgery, and we will need to have careful consideration of cases that are urgent but not emergent,” Hawaii Pacific Health President and CEO Ray Vara said in a staff memo. “Any cases that can be deferred safely should be deferred until the oxygen supply solutions are clearer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An environmental group that wants to end public-land grazing has outbid a rancher for a grazing lease on state land that includes habitat for bull trout and steelhead. Western Watersheds Project’s bid of $8,200 won the 20-year grazing lease on 620 acres in central Idaho’s Sawtooth Valley in Custer County. The group and the Idaho Cattle Association say it’s possible other state grazing leases could be sought by other environmental groups. Western Watersheds will also have to pay an annual $800 fee based on the number of sheep or cattle authorized for the allotment. “That’s still a screaming deal,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, noting that private-land grazing fees are about three times that much. “Certainly, at those prices, the parcel is a lot more valuable for conservation than it is for grazing livestock.” Molvar said the group will not graze livestock but instead convert the grazing lease into a conservation lease and allow the area to be used by wildlife, notably a herd of 50 pronghorn that frequent the area. Elk and bighorn sheep are also in the region. He also said sections of two streams running through the parcel, Fourth of July Creek and Champion Creek, will be protected. The new lease takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white police officer has been placed on administrative duty as the city’s police oversight agency investigates his struggle with a Black woman who was walking her dog in a lakefront park. Police Superintendent David Brown on Monday directed that the officer be placed on paid desk duty while what happened over the weekend is investigated, the department said. Attorneys for the woman allege the encounter became violent and was an “obvious case of racial profiling.” The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said Monday that it reviewed the officer’s body camera video and recommended he either be placed on administrative duty or be relieved of his police power while it investigates. “If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable,” interim chief Andrea Kersten said. A law office representing Nikkita Brown said she was near the lakefront with her dog about 12:10 a.m. Saturday when a police officer approached her for being in the area after the park was closed. In a video recorded by a bystander, the woman and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely, and at one point she turns around with her phone in her hand and stops. Moments later, the officer appears to reach for her phone and then grabs Brown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s health commissioner defended herself Monday against criticism arising from a photograph circulating on social media showing her not wearing a face mask during a wedding reception. Dr. Kristina Box said in a statement that she “made an informed decision” to take off her mask while dancing or talking at a recent family wedding with guests fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Box said all but five people at the wedding were fully vaccinated. Several social media comments called Box’s actions hypocritical, as she said Friday that Indiana had reached “the darkest time in the pandemic” amid a surge in infections and hospitalizations and urged more people to get COVID-19 shots and wear masks. The photo shows Box standing amid several people, none of whom are wearing masks. Box said in her statement that federal guidelines call for people to wear masks at indoor public places when in areas of “high or sustained transmission.” “I continue to wear my mask in these settings and encourage Hoosiers to do the same,” Box said. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb apologized in May 2020 after posing for a photo with two people in which none of the three wore masks inside a Brown County restaurant, a day after recommending mask-wearing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in the abduction and killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, three years after she disappeared while out for an evening run. Judge Joel Yates’ sentence for Cristhian Bahena Rivera was mandatory for a first-degree murder conviction in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. The 27-year-old former farmhand, who testified that he came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico as a teenager, has been jailed since his arrest in August 2018. Yates pointedly rejected defense claims that others were responsible for the crime. “Mr. Bahena Rivera, you and you alone forever changed the lives of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts,” he said. The sentence caps a case that inflamed anger over illegal immigration, fueled fears about violence against solo female runners, and took several noteworthy twists during and after Bahena Rivera’s trial in May. Tibbetts’ mother, Laura Calderwood, addressed Bahena Rivera in a victim impact statement read to the court. “Mollie was a young woman who simply wanted to go for a quiet run on the evening of July 18 and you chose to violently and sadistically end that life,” she wrote.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Former Gov. Jeff Colyer announced Monday that he is dropping out of the 2022 race for governor after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. “While I have always focused on helping others, for the next few weeks I am going to focus on my health,” said Colyer, a physician who served as governor for a little less than a year in 2018. In his announcement, Colyer said he was endorsing Attorney General Derek Schmidt in the governor’s race. Colyer had been Schmidt’s main rival for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s reelection. Schmidt wished Colyer “all the best in overcoming his current health challenges” in a statement and said that “now is the time to come together to elect a Republican governor for Kansas next year.” In a tweet, Kelly wished Colyer “a quick recovery.” “Colyer and I may have our disagreements. But one thing we can all agree on: the need to defeat cancer,” she wrote on Twitter. Colyer was elevated from lieutenant governor in January 2018, when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Colyer narrowly lost the 2018 Republican primary to polarizing conservative Kris Kobach, who alienated moderate GOP and independent voters and lost to Kelly that November.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The governor signaled Monday that he wants to convene a special legislative session to deal with COVID-19 issues once a “general consensus” is reached on what can be achieved. Gov. Andy Beshear said the special session needs to happen soon in part to maintain the state of emergency he declared at the outset of the pandemic in Kentucky. And there are pressing coronavirus-related issues stemming from school closures due to surging outbreaks, he said. The governor has the authority to call lawmakers into special session and to set the agenda. Beshear, a Democrat, has had discussions with leaders of the Republican-led Legislature over what actions could be taken if lawmakers are brought back to the statehouse. Those negotiations come as Kentucky suffers its worst surge of virus cases and hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Various emergency measures previously issued by Beshear are set to expire as a result of a recent landmark court decision. It’s up to lawmakers to decide whether to keep them in place. Kentucky had more new cases of COVID-19 last week than any other week in the pandemi, and on Monday reported another record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients. The highly contagious delta variant is spreading fastest among school-age Kentuckians, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A storied jazz site where a young Louis Armstrong once worked toppled when Ida blew through the state as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S. The Karnofsky Tailor Shop, where a Jewish family employed Armstrong, collapsed Sunday during the storm. Armstrong would play a small tin horn as he worked on the coal and junk wagons, according to the National Park Service. The business opened downtown in 1913 and had a residence above it where the late jazz legend would often eat meals. The family, who provided Armstrong a “second home,” lent him money to buy his first cornet. “Louis said it was the Karnofskys that instilled the love of singing in his heart,” jazz historian and retired photojournalist John McCusker said, according to WWL-TV. Morris Karnofsky, the family’s son and Armstrong’s childhood friend, opened the city’s first jazz record shop on that same street, according to the park service. Armstrong would visit Morris Music when he returned to New Orleans after moving away. When daylight came Monday morning, all that was left was a pile of bricks and other remnants of the historic site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lobster fishing industry will face a host of new harvesting restrictions amid a new push from the federal government to try to save a vanishing species of whale. The new rules, which have loomed over the profitable lobster industry for years and were announced Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale. The whales number only about 360 and are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA said it expects the new rules will result in a nearly 70% reduction of the risk of death and serious injuries the whales can suffer from entanglement. The rules had long been expected to focus on reducing the number of vertical ropes in the water, and they will. The rules reduce the number of rope lines that link buoys to lobster and crab traps, NOAA said. The rules will also require the use of weaker ropes so whales can more easily break free if they do become entangled, the agency said. NOAA said the rules also expand the areas of ocean where fishing with trap rope is prohibited or limited. Members of the lobster fishing industry have said strict new rules could make it difficult to get lobsters to consumers.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Organizers of the 80th National Folk Festival say they’re adding a fourth stage at this year’s festival, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Stage. The festival is slated to return to downtown Salisbury on Sept. 10-12 for the third year of its residency in the Eastern Shore city. Supported by Maryland Traditions, the traditional arts program of the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Area & Stage at the 80th National Folk Festival celebrates and showcases the rich, living traditions of Maryland. The area shines a spotlight on the distinctive music, rituals, crafts, occupations, foodways and other traditions at the heart of Maryland heritage, expressing both the state’s deep history and its evolving character. Performances, demonstrations, displays, exhibits, and narrative presentations by Maryland master artisans and performers explore a wide range of cultural traditions, including those of its First Peoples, the cultural legacies of European settlers, and the expressions of the newest Maryland residents whose cultural roots come from around the globe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds of students at Amherst College are pushing back against what they call the school’s overly restrictive coronavirus protocols that include double-masking indoors, restrictions on off-campus activities, and no in-person campus dining. In a letter sent to President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin a week ago, the students said that “the guidelines are not based on any given data, have been developed without student input, are significantly stricter than our peer institutions, and are in conflict with (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.” The restrictions originally announced Aug. 24 and designed in response to the spread of the delta variant apply to the first two weeks of the fall semester, which began Monday. The prestigious private liberal arts college celebrating its 200th anniversary this year had already mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. In response to the pushback, Martin wrote another campuswide email Aug. 27. “We are in the midst of a surge, and you are arriving on campus from all over the country and the world, including from delta hotspots,” she said, adding later: “Now is not yet the time to relax key restrictions.” She did, however, amend a near-universal outdoor mask mandate, calling it “unworkable.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRoyal Oak: Some animals are rolling up their fur for COVID-19 shots at the Detroit Zoo. The zoo in suburban Detroit said its gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are getting a vaccine developed by Zoetis, a veterinary drug company, and authorized by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other animals will follow. “We’re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,” said Scott Carter, the zoo’s chief life sciences officer. “The animals routinely get other vaccinations.” The zoo said no COVID-19 infections have been found in its animals. Anti-vaccine advocates have aggressively criticized other zoos nationwide that have administered the shots to their animals. But the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has said it supports the animal vaccines, which “have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has reached 300 traffic accident deaths before Labor Day for the first time in more than a decade, prompting state public safety officials on Monday to issue a plea for people to slow down. The state reported its 300th fatality Saturday – the earliest the state has eclipsed that threshold since 2007, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Office of Traffic Safety. There were 240 traffic deaths in the state at this time last year, and the state did not reach 300 until October. Officials attributed 103 of the deaths, or about 40%, to speeding, compared to 78 at this time last year. “This many preventable deaths on Minnesota roads before Labor Day is completely unacceptable,” said Office of Traffic Safety Director Mike Hanson. “It’s not a homework assignment; you don’t get a do-over. We all need to drive smart to keep our family, friends and neighbors alive.” Nearly three-fourths of all victims were male, with the majority between 21 and 30 years old. Alcohol-related deaths stand at 74, which is down from 88 at this time last year and 136 in 2011. Drunken driving-related deaths comprised 20% of all traffic fatalities in 2020 compared to more than half in the 1960s. State officials say the lower numbers are due in large part to extra impaired driving enforcement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he is feeling well, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. “To everyone who has asked, I have recovered fully from my bout with COVID-19, and I have a clean bill of health,” Wicker posted on Twitter. “I am looking forward to resuming my travel in the state this week.” Wicker, 70, is one of three senators who announced Aug. 19 that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Wicker, independent Sen. Angus King, 77, of Maine, and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, 69, of Colorado, had all been fully vaccinated. All three have recommended that people get their shots. Wicker wrote Tuesday: “Being fully vaccinated greatly reduced my risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Getting the shot is safe, easy, and free, and it could save your life.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge on Tuesday refused to reinstate federal unemployment benefits that were cut in June when Gov. Mike Parson pulled out of several programs, saying the court “would not substitute its judgment” for that of the governor. The ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem came a day after lawyers representing Missouri residents who lost the jobless benefits asked for reinstatement with back pay that, for some people, could have amounted to $1,500. The enhanced benefits from several federal programs added money to the unemployment checks for out-of-work Americans to help ease the crunch caused by shutdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic. But some Republican governors, including Parson, ended the benefits, saying they wanted to prod people to rejoin the workforce. In his four-page ruling denying a preliminary injunction, Beteem wrote that “the balancing of harms and the public interest strongly favor the Governor’s decision to promote economic recovery and encourage workers’ re-entry into Missouri’s critically understaffed labor force.” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that the ruling “affirmed the legality of Governor Parson’s decision to terminate these temporary benefits and will hopefully lead to the hiring of workers for businesses that desperately need the help.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has announced a rule encouraging schools to give parents final say on whether children should wear masks in schools, after several large school districts implemented mask requirements for all students. Gianforte, a Republican, made the announcement Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Education on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. Gianforte said in a statement that masking in schools, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, is “based on inconclusive research.” He also said masking could have adverse impacts on children’s “health, wellbeing and development.” The CDC issued its guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The rule says schools should consider “parental concerns” when adopting mask mandates and provide parents the ability to opt out of health-related mandates for a wide array of reasons including physical and mental health, developmental needs, religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state has increased in each of the past ten weeks, and the total nearly doubled over the past two weeks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread. Nebraska reported 5,006 new cases for the week ending Friday, according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from 3,755 the previous week and nearly double the 2,668 cases recorded the week before. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has also risen over the past two weeks from 190 new cases per day Aug. 15 to 715.14 new cases per day Sunday. “Those numbers speak for themselves,” said Dr. James Lawler, a co-executive director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “We’re going up, and we’re following in the footsteps of the Southern states that saw increasing cases before us. And we’ll continue that way unless something dramatic happens.” The state said 323 people were hospitalized with the virus in the state as of Thursday. Last week, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered all the state’s hospitals to delay elective surgeries, if possible, to help free up capacity, but he resisted taking other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials say they’ll use a $50,000 grant from the National Park Service to fund research about five decades of segregation, civil rights activism and advocacy in the historic West Las Vegas neighborhood. An announcement Monday said the project aims to focus on the years 1930 through 1979 in what amounted to the city’s segregated Black community. The goal is to determine what buildings and properties could be included on the National Register of Historic Places and listed on the city’s Historic Property Register. The funds to Las Vegas are part of nearly $750,000 nationwide allocated under the park service’s Underrepresented Community Grant Program, the city statement said. The city Historic Preservation Office submitted the grant request, and the city will issue a request for proposals for contracts with experienced cultural resources consultants to prepare the survey and inventory.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A milestone anniversary for the New Hampshire Film Festival is again being pushed back a year due to COVID-19. Announced Monday, the 20th annual NHFF will have to wait another year because of the pandemic. The celebration was originally scheduled for October 2020, then delayed to October 2021. Now it’s planned for 2022. An autumn tradition in Portsmouth, which has hosted the festival since 2004 after its debut in Derry three years before, the festival said it would be unable to keep up with new health and safety protocols seen in art venues and community events across the country “due to the scale and scope” of an event spread across several days and multiple venues. “We are upset to find ourselves in this extremely difficult position, but our deeper concern lies with the filmmakers, attendees, supporters, partners and sponsors who continue to struggle with the ongoing pandemic,” NHFF executive director Nicole Gregg said in a statement. Celebrating newer filmmakers and directors, as well as more experienced screenwriters and actors, the NHFF is a four-day fall event that typically draws crowds for film showings, question-and-answer sessions with film producers and actors, and receptions and parties at downtown restaurants.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: A young lifeguard was killed, and seven other people, including three other lifeguards, were injured when lightning struck a Jersey Shore beach Monday afternoon, authorities said. It marked the second death of a young lifeguard at the Jersey Shore in a little over a week. Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy said the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. “Our hearts are with the family and friends of the young lifeguard killed by today’s horrific lightning strike on the beach in Berkeley Township, and we pray for a full recovery for those injured,” Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter. “I’ve spoken to Mayor Carmen Amato and offered the full support and assistance of our administration during this difficult time.” Amato said his township’s beaches will be closed Tuesday through Thursday as crisis counselors are made available to beach staff and lifeguards. Four of those struck were lifeguards, and four others were beachgoers. “This is a tragic and heartbreaking day for our town and the entire Jersey Shore,” Amato said in a statement. “This young person was out there every day protecting the lives of others. Our lifeguard teams, like so many along the shore, develop special connections with our community throughout the summer, which makes this loss even greater.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider wants to transfer its share of a coal-fired power plant to an energy company backed by the Navajo Nation, but environmentalists argue that approving the deal would prolong the life of the plant and run counter to New Mexico’s renewable energy goals. The state Public Regulation Commission will determine whether Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s plan for Four Corners Power Plant is in the public interest during a two-week hearing that began Tuesday. It heard from the public Monday. Some of those who spoke at the virtual meeting Monday choked back tears when talking about pollution emitted by the plant over the decades, while others spoke about how their jobs at the power plant and coal mine helped to put their children through college. Some tribal members told regulators that all levels of Navajo leadership are behind the proposal. They said allowing the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to take over the utility’s stake in Four Corners would provide more time for the tribe to find ways to deal with significant economic consequences that will come when the plant closes in 2031. If regulators don’t approve PNM’s plan, the Navajo Nation could lose up to $60 million annually, said LoRenzo Bates, former speaker of the Navajo Nation Council.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Resigning from office probably didn’t end former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legal problems, and no matter what happens next, taxpayers are likely to wind up with a hefty bill. The state has already agreed to pay up to $9.5 million to lawyers representing and investigating Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, according to a review of available contracts. That figure represents the maximum amount that could be spent, not actual bills submitted so far. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee. His successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, can decide whether the state will continue to pay lawyers to defend Cuomo and his administration going forward. Cuomo and the administration face the possibility of civil lawsuits from women who have accused the Democrat of sexual harassment. The state attorney general is looking into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote. Federal prosecutors are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. He’s also facing a state ethics commission inquiry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill Monday that would do away with the permit someone must obtain from a county sheriff before buying a pistol, turning back a key agenda item of conservative gun rights supporters. Cooper’s veto was expected, and an override will be difficult for Republicans who control the General Assembly, since they lack veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Only two Democrats – both in the House – voted for doing away with the pistol purchase permitting system, which goes back more than 100 years. Cooper supports more gun-sale restrictions, not less, and his office expressed his opposition to the bill the day after the final legislative vote this month. “Gun permit laws reduce gun homicides and suicides and reduce the availability of guns for criminal activity,” Cooper said in a news release Monday. “At a time of rising gun violence, we cannot afford to repeal a system that works to save lives. The legislature should focus on combating gun violence instead of making it easier for guns to end up in the wrong hands.” Bill supporters said the current process has become duplicative with the comprehensive national checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the repeal this year after opposing it previously.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit by the state of Missouri seeking to stop a project that would supply Missouri River water to central North Dakota. The Bismarck Tribune reports the ruling will enable the federal Bureau of Reclamation to move ahead with a water service contract for the Central North Dakota Water Supply Project. The project will receive water from the McClusky Canal for systems in Burleigh, Sheridan, Wells, Foster, Kidder, McLean and Stutsman counties. The Missouri suit alleged violations of federal policy, including failure by project developers to properly study the project’s environmental impacts and its alternatives. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled against Missouri on all counts. The state of Missouri “doesn’t like any depletion from the Missouri River,” said Merri Mooridian, deputy manager of the Red River Valley Water Supply Program, which will move Missouri River water by underground pipeline from Washburn east to supply systems in the east and central parts of the state. The Central North Dakota Water Supply Project will use the same pipeline, taking nearly 13 million gallons a day. “The state of North Dakota has the right to flows of the Missouri River in the state of North Dakota,” Mooridian said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has rescinded his order that a man sentenced for a felony drug charge get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Speaking at a hearing Tuesday, Judge Christopher Wagner told Brandon Rutherford that it’s not a judge’s role to make decisions for him or “teach you to be a better person.” The reversal came nearly a month after Wagner had sentenced Rutherford. At the time, Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask in court, which Rutherford confirmed, telling the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. Neither Rutherford nor his attorney, Carl Lewis, objected to the vaccination order during the sentencing, but soon afterward Rutherford expressed concerns about the directive. Lewis said Tuesday that his 21-year-old client has concerns about the vaccine and will not get it within two months. Lewis had argued that a judge doesn’t have the power or authority to order someone to be inoculated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that seeks to crack down on protesters is unconstitutional and would chill the ability of groups to mobilize people to advocate for racial justice, a civil rights group argues in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma City, along with the national NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. The lawsuit argues the law, which takes effect Nov. 1, was written to discourage peaceful demonstrations and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantee the right of the public to peacefully assemble and give citizens equal protection under the law. The new law increases the penalties for blocking roadways, grants motorists civil and criminal immunity if they kill or injure someone while fleeing from a riot, and authorizes hefty fines for national organizations that coordinate with those found guilty of committing crimes under the state’s rioting statutes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: City employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – or obtain a medical or religious exemption – by the middle of October, or they will be fired. “With COVID-19 filling hospitals and claiming lives, we must do everything within our power to end this pandemic and restore our community’s health,” Mayor Ted Wheeler and all four City Commissioners wrote Monday in a letter to municipal workers. The city will require its approximately 6,800 employees to submit proof of vaccination, show they are in the process of being vaccinated, or apply for an exemption by Sept. 10 and be fully vaccinated or granted an exemption by Oct. 18. Those who fail to meet the deadline “will be put on a list for separation from employment,” according to the letter. The city plans to provide a comprehensive outline of the new policy later this week and to answer whatever questions municipal workers might have. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that earlier this month, Multnomah County imposed a vaccine mandate on its employees, and Gov. Kate Brown has announced similar requirements for all teachers, health care workers and state employees across Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Masks will be required in all public and private schools, as well as child care facilities, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday, reversing course amid a statewide COVID-19 resurgence that is filling hospital beds just as students return to class. The Department of Health order will take effect Tuesday, Sept. 7 – a week or more after the start of school in many districts – and will require students, teachers and staff to wear masks when inside, regardless of vaccination status, the Wolf administration said. The order will not apply to student-athletes while they’re playing, nor to outdoor activities. “Wearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom and to keep COVID out of that classroom,” Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association said the decision on masking should have been left to local school officials, but it would nevertheless remind school districts “of their legal obligation related to the directive.” Less than a month ago, Wolf had ruled out a statewide mask mandate for schools after requiring them last year. But the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has changed the administration’s calculus about what is needed to keep students in class.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The union that represents nurses at the state’s only Level 1 trauma hospital is calling on its parent company to increase the pay of nurses who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union on Tuesday delivered a petition with more than 2,000 signatures to Lifespan Corp., which operates Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Lifespan, the state’s largest health care organization, has already increased compensation for nurses at some of its other hospitals. “We provide a critical component of patient care in Rhode Island, yet during this unprecedented health crisis, Lifespan seems to have forgotten about us,” Frank Sims, a Rhode Island Hospital nurse and union president, said in a statement. “While the nurses at Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital are being recognized for their front line service with appropriate compensation increases during this crisis, Lifespan has refused to do the same for Rhode Island Hospital nurses.” A Lifespan spokesperson said the system provides nurses with “highly competitive wage and benefits packages.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A private college is allowing men to live on campus for the first time since it was founded 167 years ago. About 45 men moved into a dorm set aside for them at Columbia College this month, media outlets report. College officials said last year that they decided to bring men to what had been an all-women college because enrollment had fallen 25% in the past decade. “Most women now are looking for a co-educational experience. Also, we really believe the opportunity that we provide and the environment we have is a good one for men to grow. And so it’s expanding our outreach to men of course but also to a broader group of women,” said Columbia College President Tom Bogart, who took over as leader of the school in October. Jordan Wright was one of the first men to move into the Columbia College dorms. “I feel like it’s a good experience,” Wright said. “It’s a new beginning and new blessings. I know it’s a little different now, but I feel like everything is still going to go good with the boys and girls, even though it’s a new thing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that she has activated nine soldiers from the state National Guard to help with coronavirus testing in the western part of the state amid a surge of infections. “This past week, I had conversations with all three South Dakota hospital systems and asked them what they needed as cases start to rise again,” she said in a statement. “Monument asked for the National Guard to assist them in their testing efforts, and we are happy to help.” Over the past two weeks, the average number of infections has tripled statewide. The western part of the state has been the hardest-hit, with Meade County, which hosted the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally earlier this month, leading the state in new cases per capita. The Department of Health reported last week that it had traced 63 cases among rallygoers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide reached 216 – the largest number since January. Two deaths were also reported Tuesday, bringing the total death toll of people with COVID-19 in the state to 2,069. The health department said Pennington County had more than twice as many new COVID-19 cases in the prior day than any other county in the state. Noem activated the National Guard last year to prepare field hospitals for a surge in patients, but the hospitals were not utilized.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that notoriously blocked a federal dam project in the state decades ago, should no longer be on the endangered species list, federal officials announced Tuesday. Arguing that the fish is no longer in danger of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun the process to delist the species, a move backed by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has favored lifting protections for the fish since 2019. “Thanks to the persistence of many people, the extinction of the snail darter was ultimately avoided, and today we can celebrate its recovery,” said Zygmunt Plater, the attorney who wrote the citizens’ petition to save the snail darter in 1975. Snail darters, a member of the perch family, grow up to 3.5 inches long and mostly eat freshwater snails. Shortly after the passage of the landmark 1973 Endangered Species Act, construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Tellico Dam in eastern Tennessee threatened the habitat of the newly discovered fish, located just above the site of the project. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, marking the first time the nation’s highest court took up an ESA case. In 1978, the court ruled in favor of protections for the fish and halted work on the nearly completed dam. Congress later exempted the dam from the law to allow the project to be completed. But the TVA worked to transplant the snail darter to other rivers and streams.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The GOP-controlled Legislature passed a broad overhaul of the state’s election laws Tuesday, tightening already strict voting rules and dealing a bruising defeat to Democrats who waged a months­long fight over what they argued was a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will sign the bill, the latest in a national GOP campaign to add new hurdles to voting in the name of security, spurred in part by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. Texas Democrats fought the legislation for months, arguing the bill was tailored to make it harder for young people, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – all Democratic-leaning voters – to cast ballots, just as they see the demographics shifting to favor their party. The bill specifically targets Democratic strongholds, including Houston’s Harris County, further tightening rules in a state already considered among the hardest places to cast a ballot. The legislation set off a heated summer in Texas of walkouts by Democrats, Republicans threatening them with arrest, Abbott vetoing the paychecks of thousands of rank-and-file staffers when the bill failed to reach him sooner, and accusations of racism and voter suppression. Even the final vote did not escape a parting round of confrontation after Senate Republicans, at the last minute, scuttled one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement: efforts to shield voters with felony convictions from prosecution if they did not realize they were ineligible to cast a ballot. It had been included following backlash over the arrests of two Texas voters, both of whom are Black.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox cast doubt on the efficacy of mask-wearing Tuesday as health leaders made some of their most impassioned pleas yet for Utahns to mask up and get vaccinated. Cox, a Republican, said his administration is encouraging people to wear masks but said it is unclear whether they are effective against the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. “Masks are not as effective as most of the pro-mask crowd are arguing,” Cox told reporters at a news conference. “We know that they’re just not.” Cox offered no specific evidence to support his assertion, and his comments contradicted public health experts, as well as statements Utah’s state epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Hofmann made a few minutes earlier at the same news conference. State hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to prevent the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. “There will be enduring harm to our children and generations to come if we do not stop the divisiveness around the things we know work like masks and vaccines,” Hofmann said. “We know the path to healing is the end of this pandemic, and it hasn’t ended yet even if we want to pretend it has.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Nearly all arriving students at the University of Vermont have been vaccinated against COVID-19. UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials are still working with fewer than 100 students to bring them into compliance with the school’s inoculation requirement. Earlier this month UVM reinstituted an indoor mask mandate for all faculty, staff, students and visitors on the Burlington campus. The exact size of this year’s school enrollment won’t be known for several weeks, but it’s expected to be more than 13,000. The incoming freshman class is expected to have about 3,000 students. “In wonderful news for the years ahead, an extraordinary new class of Catamounts have joined us this fall – with more than 25,000 applications for admission, the incoming class is on track to being the best academically prepared and the largest we’ve ever welcomed!” President Suresh Garimella said in a message to the student body. Students at colleges and universities across Vermont are returning for the fall semester amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, this time driven by the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons Tuesday to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman, in a case that attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. Northam announced the pardons after meeting with about a dozen descendants of the men and their advocates. Cries and sobs could be heard from some of the descendants after Northam’s announcement. The “Martinsville Seven,” as the men became known, were all convicted of raping 32-year-old Ruby Stroud Floyd, a white woman who had gone to a predominantly black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia, on Jan. 8, 1949, to collect money for clothes she had sold. Four of the men were executed in Virginia’s electric chair Feb. 2, 1951. Three days later, the remaining three were also electrocuted. All of them were tried by all-white juries. It was the largest group of people executed for a single-victim crime in Virginia’s history. At the time, rape was a capital offense. But Northam said Tuesday that the death penalty for rape was applied almost exclusively to Black people. Northam said the pardons are an acknowledgement that the men did not receive due process and faced racial bias.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus pandemic is filling hospitals at an “alarming” rate and continuing to strain health care workers, state health officials said Monday. And for the first time during the pandemic, hospitals are also seeing large numbers of sick pregnant patients, said Dr. Tanya Sorensen, the executive medical director of women’s health at Swedish Health Services. She noted pregnant patients are generally less likely to be inoculated against COVID-19. “We’re seeing ICU admissions, maternal deaths, babies born prematurely either to help the mother breathe or rescue the baby,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking. … Pregnant women need to be vaccinated.” As of Monday morning, the state’s hospitals and health care centers were treating 1,570 COVID-19 patients, Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Of those, 188 were on ventilators. Eleven days ago, the hospital association had counted 1,240 patients with 152 on ventilators. “It’s an enormous stress on a health care system to have this many patients with a single diagnosis,” she said. “This doesn’t happen. … It’s very, very alarming.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A historic suspension bridge will be undergoing major repairs, but it’s not clear whether the span will reopen to traffic. The West Virginia Division of Highways and Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday that a $17.9 million contract had been awarded to repair and rehabilitate the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register reports. The project will make repairs on the span’s superstructure and substructure as well as clean, paint, replace damaged suspension cables and renovate lighting, officials said. “It is absolutely fantastic news for the city of Wheeling to know that its most iconic structure, the suspension bridge, is going to be fully repaired and rehabilitated,” Mayor Glenn Elliott said Monday. The future of the historic 1849 bridge was in question after officials closed the span to vehicle traffic in 2019 since motorists repeatedly ignored Division of Highways weight restrictions and warnings on the structure. Multiple overweight vehicles tried to cross it, leading to damage, and it’s unclear whether the repairs will allow the bridge to reopen to traffic. After the contractor begins work on the bridge, crews will determine the extent of the damage, and officials will then determine how the bridge will be used going forward.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: A school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course, with parents and others packing the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more coronavirus-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: More staff than inmates at the state’s men’s prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month, the Department of Corrections said late last week. Since July 23, the state has reported 43 cases of COVID-19 among staff at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington. A total of 20 inmates in those two facilities tested positive for the virus over the same period of time. “Historically, we’ve had far more positives in our inmate population, as a percentage of the population, than we’ve had for staff,” Wyoming Department of Corrections spokesperson Paul Martin said Wednesday. “I think that trend is changing now.” About 35% of prison employees report being fully vaccinated, compared to 64% of inmates, the agency said. Vaccinations are not required for anyone, Martin told the Casper Star-Tribune, but are offered to employees and inmates. Inmates are still wearing face coverings and social distancing, Martin said. The only facility that did not experience an outbreak during the peak of the pandemic was the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. This month, the women’s prison has reported five cases among staff and 11 among inmates.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}]}

An attorney often agrees to represent a consumer in such cases on a contingency basis.\n\nRoberson says she's lost $5,266 in all — the two ATM withdrawals, one $2,000 transfer out of her account to a person she doesn’t know, another $1,000 transfer to someone she doesn’t know and a mobile banking transfer for $266 that she says she didn’t make.\n\n\"All of that, just wiped out overnight, all that money,\" said Roberson, recalling the ordeal months later as she sat in her pleasant apartment in Clinton Township. Her paycheck for her job as a health aide had just been sent via direct deposit into her account.\n\nTo boot, she got hit with a $19 overdraft fee because her rent check bounced after the fraud took place.\n\n\"I want my money,\" Roberson said.\n\nThe four women I talked with all said they were on tight budgets, and losing anywhere from $1,000 to more than $5,000 each to fraud meant some bills initially didn't get paid.\n\nWhat's unsettling is that consumers tend to have more potential clear-cut protections involving some fraudulent ATM withdrawals than other situations, such as when a scam involves a wire transfer of money out of your account. But these consumers didn't get any money back.\n\nConsumer advocates share customer concerns. Some maintain that stronger, enforceable protections are needed to require banks and payment companies to take more responsibility for the fraud that enters their systems.\n\nIt shouldn't be this hard, overall, but it is. It really is for many consumers.\n\nMichigan First Credit Union says it follows regulations\n\nMichigan First Credit Union is among the top 20 out of 186 credit unions in Michigan by a ranking of assets, based on data from America's Credit Unions, an advocacy group. Michigan First Credit Union started 98 years ago as the Detroit Teachers Credit Union.\n\nThe state's largest credit union is Lake Michigan Credit Union with about $14.26 billion in assets.\n\nA spokesperson for Michigan First Credit Union said privacy laws prevent the credit union from answering questions about specific situations involving customers. But the credit union maintains that it is following regulations.\n\nIn a statement responding to questions from the Detroit Free Press, the credit union said: \"Each member claim is investigated based on its unique circumstances and where law or regulation requires that a member be reimbursed, Michigan First promptly reimburses the members.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Unfortunately, not every claim raised by our members is reimbursable under state or federal law.\"\n\nThe credit union noted that fraud is \"by no means unique to Michigan First\" and is on the rise in banking and other industries. The credit union said it is constantly updating its technology and educating its members to combat fraud.\n\n\"Every situation is unique, and our fraud investigation team takes every report of fraud very seriously and works diligently to investigate and resolve the matter. There are many cases where our members have been reimbursed. \"\n\n\"Michigan First fully complies with all of its obligations under both state and federal law, including all applicable regulations.\"\n\nThe credit union said it works with legal counsel to ensure compliance with \"all laws governing our member’s accounts and the investigation of member claims and disputes.\"\n\nAccount holders wait for an explanation\n\nThe stories I heard from four victims while reporting this column over the past few months remain troubling, as these women did not receive much explanation on how their money was stolen. The rules of the road often aren't clear — and it doesn't help when financial institutions often don't disclose exactly what they maintain consumers did wrong to fuel the fraud and why they aren't protected.\n\nSome victims shared their experiences with me in the spring after I wrote a column in May about another type of online fraud involving a $1,379.60 credit card purchase. The money paid for concert tickets for a show, which took place a year ago, given by R&B artist Maxwell in Alabama.\n\nThe tickets were never used, and the Michigan First Credit Union customer in Grosse Pointe Woods said she did not buy them. That customer still has not seen what she said are unauthorized charges removed from her credit card, even though she disputed them. When I inquired about this case at the time, Michigan First Credit Union told me it was prohibited by federal law from \"confirming if someone is a member or sharing specific details about accounts, transactions, or claims.\"\n\nFinancial upheaval hit right when she was heading out of town\n\nAmber Ewing, of Allen Park, became alarmed when she spotted that she was overdrawn by $530 in late March. She was about to take her daughter on a trip to North Carolina and thought the overdraft had to be an error because she was just paid that day.\n\nIt was horrible timing, triggering a great deal of stress.\n\nEwing filed a police report in Allen Park on March 28 reporting that her paycheck was deposited to her account at Michigan First Credit Union. According to the police report, Ewing said $980 was withdrawn from a Michigan First Credit Union ATM in Eastpointe, some 23 miles from her home, by someone other than her.\n\nEwing, 44, reviewed her online banking account, according to the police report, and also discovered that $1,000 was transferred out of her Michigan First Credit Union account during the night to a woman who was supposedly named \"Carolyn Sheppard.\" No idea who that is, Ewing said. But at one point, she believed that a Zelle account was opened for another credit union member in her 70s and closed the same day as part of the scam.\n\nEwing said Zelle is automatically part of the Michigan First app. She speculated that the crooks used a desktop computer, took her credentials and sent money out of her account via Zelle at 2:40 a.m., according to the Zelle history in her credit union app.\n\n\"The account that was opened was a Michigan First account that they closed the same day,\" Ewing said.\n\nEwing reported the fraud incidents to the credit union and had her account suspended. But she has not been able to get any money back. She took out a loan to deal with bills after the financial loss.\n\nEwing said it's a trauma that she has tried to put behind her, but she is concerned about elderly customers who may be unaware that something like this could happen. \"Who will advocate for them?\" she said.\n\nOne day, she was shocked she couldn't buy a cup of coffee\n\nElena Herrada, 67, lives on $2,100 a month — her Social Security check and a $455 monthly pension after working for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union Local 1064 where she started as a business representative and later rose to local union president. The former Warren-based union local once had contracts that covered cafeteria workers in factories.\n\nOn May 30, the day after Herrada knew she was to get a direct deposit of retirement money, she was with a friend in Flint and couldn't even pick up the tab for their coffee. Her debit card was declined. It had to be a mistake, she thought, knowing she tracks every dime closely. She stopped working full time in 2018, but has picked up some limited work when able.\n\n\"When you live on as little money as I do, it's really not hard to follow your money,\" Herrada said.\n\nWhen she went to the credit union the day after she couldn't buy coffee, she discovered that about $2,455 had been withdrawn by someone else from her account — including $455 in cash taken at the Michigan First Credit Union ATM on Wyoming. She filed a police report at the 3rd Precinct in Detroit. She said she was told by the credit union that someone had used a paperless app so that a debit card wasn't needed to withdraw her money at the ATM.\n\n\"Somebody was actually watching it and got it the day it dropped,\" Herrada said.\n\nIn addition, she said, $2,000 was stolen when that money was transferred into another account that wasn't hers. She's not sure whether crooks used a Zelle account or another method to get that money.\n\nThe credit union sent her one letter on June 11, saying that no error had occurred. \"Records show that you voluntarily provided your one-time passcode to another individual,\" according to letter.\n\n\"I never got my money back,\" Herrada said during an interview in October.\n\n\"That was an entire month of my livelihood,\" she said. \"It's a month of all my money that I'm never going to get back.\"\n\nHerrada said she has had many calls in the past from the credit union, asking whether she bought something, maybe like at a gas station in Chicago, that she didn't. \"If I said no,\" she said, \"they'd say, 'OK, we're going to report it to the fraud department.' \"\n\nShe received a call a few months ago where the caller ID claimed it was Michigan First Credit Union and she was then asked about purchases she didn't make. Herrada said she gave the caller permission to give the information to the fraud department.\n\n\"The credit union told me the reason that this was my fault was because I gave someone a code to get into my account,\" Herrada said. \"Which I absolutely dispute. I did not give anyone permission to get into my account.\"\n\nAt times, she said, she's more upset with the credit union for the way it treated her than she is with the hackers. Besides not getting her money back, she was hit with a string of fees when bills set up on autopay couldn't be covered when her account fell short after the fraud.\n\n\"First, they don't watch my money, then they fine me because it's not there,\" Herrada said.\n\nShe has since refinanced her home in Corktown where she has lived for 30 years to pay off all her loans to the credit union. (Now that Corktown is a hot area in Detroit, she said, real estate agents \"circle like sharks.\" She's not moving.)\n\nShe opened an account at a major bank to receive a direct deposit of her retirement checks there. She remains a credit union member after 45 years, keeping a small amount of savings at the credit union. Overall, though, she wanted to move on because she didn't feel the credit union was doing enough to prevent the fraud, and instead indicated that it could happen again.\n\n\"It's like saying the lock on your front door is broken,\" Herrada said, \"but we're not going to fix it, so just be careful.\"\n\nShe still had her ATM card but crooks struck anyway\n\nChevelle Price, 56, said she lost about $1,000 from her account at Michigan First Credit Union, which wiped out her entire account. The crooks, she said, got the money from the credit union's ATM at Wyoming Avenue and Seven Mile Road in Detroit. She typically goes to the main branch on Evergreen in Lathrup Village.\n\n\"I've never taken $1,000 out at the ATM,\" Price told the Free Press. She filed a police report with at the 8th Precinct in Detroit on June 17. She told police she still had her ATM card in her possession at the time of the fraud.\n\nPrice also received a call that claimed to be from the fraud department of the credit union. The caller read her the amount of the last deposit she made to cover her bills, money from family members who are trying to help her out during an illness.\n\n\"They knew exactly what it was,\" said Price, who used to be a home health aide before she ran into her own health problems.\n\nFraudsters in the past had gained access to her account, ordering flowers and paying their cellphone bill, Price said. But in those cases, the credit union made her whole. She, too, didn't suspect anything was wrong when she got another call.\n\nPrice remembers that she read back a one-time code when she was on the call that she thought was with a credit union representative who was helping to clear things up.\n\nThen, though, she thought something didn't feel right when she got off the phone and talked to her daughter who encouraged her to call the credit union again. When she called, the credit union representative said no one called her.\n\nPrice described the whole situation as \"sickening.\" After the money was stolen, she wasn't able to pay all her bills and has since been playing catch-up.\n\nThe credit union, she said, later told her that she was a victim of spoofing, where crooks try to convince you that you're communicating with a legitimate source. The credit union said she should have known she was being spoofed.\n\n\"I don't know nothing about spoofing,\" Price said.\n\nSuch schemes can work, in part, because online thieves often use real phone numbers on caller ID and make emails appear to be from your bank, credit card issuer or a payment app, when they are not.\n\nWhen Price filed the police report in Detroit, she said she was told that several others had filed a police report on the same issue involving the same credit union. Detroit Police did not readily offer information to confirm Price's statement.\n\nShe says the caller had her PIN number\n\nRobin Wagner, the attorney who represents Roberson, who lost $5,266, said Roberson's phone records indicated that the call in March was indeed the phone number for Michigan First Credit Union. While the number could have been spoofed, Wagner said, it gave Roberson reason to believe the credit union was making the call.\n\nThe caller who phoned at 7:03 p.m. March 29 indicated there was suspicious activity on Roberson's accounts, according to legal documents filed by Wagner in the case. \"A woman in Texas appeared to be attempting to withdraw $500 from her account and he asked if this was authorized.\"\n\nRoberson told the caller it wasn't authorized, according to the filing, and asked the man to stop the withdrawal. The call lasted 22 minutes, according to the legal filing.\n\nRoberson said the credit union alerted her to fraud in the past, which made the phone call in March seem even more plausible. She was reimbursed in the past.\n\nRoberson, who has worked as a health aide with elderly patients, said the whole event stressed her out so much that lost nearly 30 pounds, down to 106 pounds. She doesn't believe she's at fault.\n\nRoberson, 47, said whoever called had her PIN number, her account number and read them to her and asked her to confirm the numbers. Believing she was talking with someone at the credit union out to prevent fraud, she confirmed the numbers.\n\nShe believed she received an email during the process, but she received a text, according to her phone records. Roberson maintains, according to legal filings, that she did not provide anyone with the number in the message. Instead, she said, the man on the phone read the number to her.\n\nThe caller read the number to Roberson, according to the legal filing, but he made a mistake on one digit, and Roberson corrected him.\n\n\"He told me my password because my account was locked.\"\n\nIn addition to the ATM transactions, her banking records show that the $2,000 was transferred to someone named \"Charity Annette Wade\" on March 29. The $1,000 was transferred to a \"Christina J. Bailey\" on March 30. Again, Roberson has no idea who these people are or why they got her money. Or even, really, if those names are real.\n\nRoberson said she never clicked on anything or read anything from an email that was sent to her during the call.\n\nAccording to the legal complaint filed in District Court 41B in Clinton Township, the caller told Roberson that Michigan First Credit Union would be locking her accounts. She would be contacted by a law enforcement agency in the future, the caller said. She was never contacted by law enforcement.\n\nSecurity cameras offer some strange sights\n\nWagner, the attorney who represents Roberson and filed the complaint against Michigan First Credit Union, shared photos and videos that she received from the credit union as part of discovery in the case.\n\nTwo unidentified people, who appear to be younger men, are pictured at separate times late at night withdrawing money from Roberson's account at the ATM on Wyoming in Detroit.\n\nOne person wore a green hat with a white triangle on top and a green jacket with what looks like a white varsity letter B. The person had a mustache, wore a large diamond-like stud earring and appeared to have a tattoo that ran from below one ear down the neck just above the shoulder. That photo was stamped March 29, 2024, at 11:18 p.m.\n\nAnother photo showed someone else who wore a black jacket, with the hood up and white lettering inside the hood like a fashion logo. A black mask covered the mouth, nose and ears. The person wore large black frame glasses. That photo is stamped at 12:53 a.m. on March 30, 2024. A video appears to show the person making two withdrawals of cash and turning around frequently to watch traffic. The person stays on the phone, using one hand to hold the phone and another to punch in numbers.\n\nThe ATM is in the wall of the credit union branch and part of drive-thru service, which is located at Wyoming and Cambridge in Detroit. The unidentified people in the photos walked up to the ATM; they did not drive cars or trucks through the drive-thru lane.\n\nThe credit union branch neighbors both a residential and business area, not far from Detroit school system's Bates Academy, kindergarten through eighth grade, and the University of Detroit Jesuit High School. The branch sits next to a now vacant Rite Aid.\n\nWagner, an attorney at Pitt McGehee Palmer Bonanni & Rivers, PC of Royal Oak, said the security camera pictures of the people withdrawing money — both staying on cellphones — are not Keta Roberson. Wagner said records indicated an android phone was used for mobile transactions; Roberson had an iPhone X.\n\nIt's unclear to her, Wagner said, if the people pictured used a phone to withdraw money at the ATM or an ATM card. Roberson had her card, Wagner said. But a card isn't always necessary.\n\nThe Michigan First Credit Union website gives steps for \"cardless transactions\" without your ATM or debit card. You'd use a mobile app. And you'd need to generate a new number.\n\nA nine-digit code will be displayed and be valid for 60 seconds. It \"can be used at the ATM for a single transaction. For security purposes, you will be required to generate a new code for each additional transaction,\" the website notes.\n\nIn other types of fraud, crooks engage in card skimming. Crooks harvest data, including your PIN number, when you make a purchase at a compromised point-of-sale terminal at a gas station or grocery story or withdraw money at an ATM, said Carla Sanchez-Adams, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nA small camera near the device could be illegally installed and used to record the consumer entering a PIN number into an ATM. Or a fake keypad could be placed over a real ATM keypad to steal PIN numbers. And then crooks use counterfeit debit cards.\n\nTheft hits vulnerable households harder than others\n\nEarly on, Roberson thought the credit union had resolved the problem. But she was shocked to learn on April 1 that the money was stolen. The panic that set in only made things worse.\n\nShe rushed during her work hours to a credit union branch in a Kroger store in Madison Heights to see whether anything could be done. Taking quick action triggered another loss: Leaving work early meant she would lose a day's pay and a biweekly bonus that is given for completing one's job as scheduled. She estimates that cost her about $1,200.\n\n\"I never missed that bonus in a year and a half,\" she said.\n\nThe loss at Michigan First Credit Union hangs over Roberson, particularly given other bills and burdens.\n\nRoberson said she felt she could no longer afford study materials for classes in surgical technology at Macomb County Community College. Her federal income taxes were due April 15. And she wanted a new phone after the fraud, including getting her phone number changed, because she wasn't sure how crooks got access to her account.\n\n\"I didn't trust anybody,\" she said.\n\nShe's still a member of the credit union because she has her car loan there. Though she isn't working now for health reasons, she has been able to stay in her apartment with the help of a friend.\n\nRoberson had another another account at a different credit union that had approximately $5,000 in it at the time of the fraud, according to Wagner. No influx of money after the fraud took place hit that account, Wagner added.\n\nLike some others who lost money in bank account-related scams, Roberson said she believes that the crooks knew when to strike to get access to her paycheck after it was direct-deposited into the account. Roberson, a certified nurse assistant, said she only took seven days off in the month before, leading up to a fairly decent paycheck.\n\n\"I worked very hard, 12-hour shifts,\" she said.\n\nRoberson exercised reasonable care, Wagner said, and called the bank immediately. \"She did everything she could have done,\" Wagner said. Roberson, she said, didn't know the people who received transfers and she didn't benefit from the transactions.\n\nMichigan law, Wagner said, requires the credit union to do a good faith investigation. \"And they couldn't have,\" she said, \"because they didn't provide her with any information that makes it sound like they did an investigation.\"\n\n\"They didn't really follow through in any meaningful way. They're not providing any credible explanation of what happened, honestly,\" Wagner said.\n\n\"Somehow, they didn't seem to think it odd that she was pulling thousands of dollars out of her account in a day?\" Wagner said. She expects a court hearing later in November.\n\nThe credit union also has an arbitration clause for its customers, which requires all matters except for those filed in small claims court, to be adjudicated through arbitration. And the credit union is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit because of the arbitration agreement.\n\nRoberson, according to the complaint, \"maintained full possession and control of her ATM Card for Michigan First Credit Union and never shared either card or her PIN with anyone.\"\n\nUnder federal law, a consumer’s liability for an unauthorized use of an ATM card is not related to the consumer’s negligence and depends instead on the consumer’s promptness in reporting the loss or theft of the access device.\n\nMichigan First Credit Union noted that \"generally speaking, if money is withdrawn from someone’s account using a stolen PIN, that withdrawal would usually be considered unauthorized.\"\n\n\"Whether a PIN was stolen needs to be determined based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding how the PIN ended up in someone’s possession,\" the credit union said in a statement.\n\nIn most cases, the credit union said, a wire transfer is not considered to be an electronic funds transfer and is governed by a different body of law.\n\nBank wire transfers typically are covered by weaker state Uniform Commercial Code laws. If the fraudster makes the transfer, there is some protection for unauthorized transfers. But banks can use loopholes or ambiguities to deny reimbursement.\n\n\"If the consumer made the transfer, what we call a fraudulently induced transfer, banks will refuse to reimburse and there is no clear remedy,\" said Lauren Saunders, associate director for the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nWhen it comes to ATMs, Saunders said, a withdrawal is unauthorized even if you are defrauded into giving a fraudster your PIN without realizing that they were going to take money out of your account.\n\n\"But if you gave your ATM card and PIN to your son so he could take money out, even if he took out more than you said he could, that would be authorized,\" Saunders said.\n\nOn April 8, Roberson received a notice of final determination from the credit union that stated that after the credit union researched the dispute, it concluded no error occurred. The letter, according to Wagner and the legal complaint, then falsely accused Roberson of providing her passcode to another person and being responsible for the theft of her own money.\n\nWhat action should consumers take?\n\nConsumers cannot sit back and do nothing when they spot fraud, of course.\n\nYou should notify your bank or credit union within two business days of discovering the loss or theft of your security code or PIN for your debit card or bank account, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"By reporting the theft within two business days, you’re protected from paying for transactions over $50 charged by someone who steals and uses your security code or PIN,\" according to the CFPB. \"Never write your PIN on your debit card or keep it written down in your wallet, in case your card or wallet is lost or stolen.\"\n\nNotify your bank if you spot an unauthorized withdrawal on your bank statement. \"At the latest,\" the CFPB states, \"you must notify your bank within 60 days after your bank or credit union sends your statement showing the unauthorized transaction.\"\n\nThe longer you wait, the more you risk being hit with paying the full amount of any transactions that occurred after the 60-day period and before you notify your bank.\n\nIf a situation such as lengthy travel or hospitalization keeps you from notifying the bank within the time allowed, the notification periods must be extended.\n\nIf you're having trouble getting your money, you can submit a complaint online or call the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau toll-free at 855-411-2372.\n\nConsumers need to be suspicious of every contact that appears to be made from a financial institution or other trusted entity. We're hearing of more cases where consumers aren't getting money back, including Zelle transactions.\n\nA U.S. Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations in July, for example, disclosed that nearly two-thirds of consumers were not reimbursed for their losses in 2023 when they disputed a transaction after falling victim to scams involving Zelle at three major banks: Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Nearly $102.3 million was not reimbursed in 2023, according to the report.\n\nThe subcommittee found several areas where Congress, regulators and the companies that participate in the Zelle Network could take steps to improve consumer protection, including amending the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require financial institutions to reimburse consumers for “fraudulently induced” authorized transactions.\n\nIt was also recommended that the CFPB update Regulation E to require financial institutions to provide greater transparency and more clarity on what constitutes a “reasonable” investigation. The goal is to create a higher standard for dispute investigations, giving banks a minimum set of requirements.\n\nCyber crooks make good money by targeting checking accounts and bank accounts. Scammers hope to catch you off guard.\n\nThey're not just impersonating the IRS or Amazon. Many times, scammers will impersonate your bank or credit union — and trigger a long list of headaches that you'd never imagine.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Then, when they have been duped into a relationship, they extract something from them – money or emotional pain.”\n\nThe term “catfishing” is believed to originate from the 2010 documentary Catfish, about a budding online relationship that takes an unexpected turn.\n\nPeople who engage in catfishing may steal photos, videos and personal information to create a fake profile or website in order to fool their target – and such scams appear to be increasingly common.\n\nA survey of more than 2,000 UK adults last year for BetMinded found that 20% of respondents had been catfished, “with 38% of 25-34 year-olds revealing they’ve fallen for a fake profile”, North Wales Live reported.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRemy Le Fevre, global head of communications at dating app Badoo, told Metro that as well as using someone else’s image or information to create a new social media or dating profile, “modern approaches to catfishing also involve people who stretch the truth, find ways of aligning their personality with your own likes and dislikes, or outwardly lying about things such as their height, age and/or job.\n\n“These misrepresentations can be supported by using technology to ‘prove’ a version of themselves which isn’t real, such as editing images,” he added.\n\nHow can targets spot a potential catfish?\n\nAccording to Metro, “alarm bells should ring if someone you’ve matched is really reluctant to meet up in person or constantly bails and attempts to reschedule keep falling through”.\n\nOther warning signs include them avoiding phone or video calls, and asking for “money or favours” or for “sexy pics and videos”, said the paper. A catfish may also “go AWOL without any explanation”, come on “super strong”, and be “shifty about giving you different social media profiles”.\n\nAge UK advises being wary if “you’ve searched their name on the internet but they don’t seem to exist” or “the photos don’t match the photos on their dating profile”. Also take care if “their stories sometimes conflict with each other, or don’t quite add up”, said the charity.\n\nWhat are the laws on catfishing?\n\nCatfishing “is not an offence in its own right”, said The Times. A 2014 review of social media and the law by the Lords Communications Committee concluded that sufficent laws were in place to prosecute criminal offences committed over social media.\n\nInternet law specialists Cohen Davis solicitors explained that with the exception of harassment, “there are no criminal laws against impersonation on social media”.\n\nBut “while fake online profiles on social media might not by themselves be illegal”, the law firm added, “there are other activities that engage catfishing or fake online accounts that may turn otherwise lawful activity into activity which is unlawful”.\n\nWhen does it cross the legal line?\n\nCatfishing “might be illegal” if the fraudster obtained money or goods “due to the fraud”, said Cohen Davis.\n\nA catfish could also be charged “with a number of non-consensual sex related criminal offences” if “romance fraud had led to sexual contact”, because “any consent given by the victim to the contact could be rendered void”, according to the firm.\n\nAnd if a victim has handed over private information, they “may pursue a claim for breach of privacy against the fraudster in the civil courts”.\n\nPlanned changes to the Online Safety Bill will also require social media sites and search engines “to stamp out fraudsters and scammers on their platforms”, said the government.\n\nUnder the proposals, published earlier this year, search engines and platforms that host user-generated content, video-sharing or live streaming will have “a duty of care to protect users of their services from fraud committed by other users”, the government said. “This includes ‘catfishing’ romance scams.”\n\nWhy is catfishing making headlines?\n\nThe hit podcast Sweet Bobby, produced by Tortoise Media, has played a key role in bringing the issue of catfishing to the public’s attention and sparked a campaign for online deception to be made into a specific criminal offence.\n\nThe campaign is being spearheaded by Kirat Assi, who was drawn via Facebook into an online relationship with a cardiologist named Bobby, “a man who really exists and whom she in fact vaguely knew”, said The Times.\n\nBut “it wasn’t the real Bobby communicating with her but a younger female cousin of hers called Simran Bhogal using a fake profile”, the paper continued. “The relationship began as a friendship, became romantic, and lasted throughout Assi’s thirties.”\n\nOver the course of a decade, Bhogal created a 50-strong cast of fake online personas, weaving together countless lies and fantastical tales that at one point involved Bobby dying and then coming back to life and going into a witness-protection programme.\n\nHer “aim was not to extract money from Assi, but seemingly to make her believe she was in an authentic, romantic relationship”, wrote Proudman in The Guardian. Assi “described being controlled by Bobby as he monitored her movements and dictated her everyday life choices”, and claimed that the relationship had “a profound effect on her mental and physical health”.\n\nProudman said that “if this had of been a straightforward case of two authentic people in a relationship it would surely have screamed coercive control, which has been a criminal offence since 2015”. Instead, Assi reached a settlement in a civil case against Bhogal for harassment, misuse of private information and data protection breaches.\n\nBut “it should never have been left to a victim of abuse to pursue her perpetrator in the civil courts”, argued Proudman.\n\nAssi told The Times that legal changes were needed so that would-be catfish “know that if you’re caught then immediately it’s a crime, just like driving with a mobile in your hand.\n\n“It would be an immediate deterrent, so many people will still do it but some people will think, ‘I’m just not risking it’,” she said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2022/09/23/bitcoin-atm-cryptocurrency-qr-code-scam/7842125001/", "title": "Bitcoin ATMs, QR codes used as weapon by scammers: What to know", "text": "Driving back, all Jacquelyn Halushka could think about was how weird it was to be feeding five $100 bills into a bitcoin ATM at a liquor store.\n\nShe had never been to the Star Market on a winding, rural part of Joslyn Road in Lake Orion where the Cash2Bitcoin ATM stands by the front window, next to the regular ATM and some Bud Light Seltzer.\n\n\"I never bought bitcoin before,\" she said.\n\nAll Halushka, 27, wanted was a good paying job. And they told her in early August that the bitcoin task was part of the process.\n\nAfter a long job interview via a messaging app, Halushka was told she was hired. She received a contract and later a $6,548 check was overnighted to her home in Oakland Township by Federal Express for her to buy Apple computer products to work remotely as an administrative assistant for a biopharmaceutical company.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nShe took a photo of the check to deposit it through her bank's mobile app. Her bank only made $500 immediately available.\n\nAnd the scammers convinced her to drive to the bank to get five $100 bills and send that money via a crypto wallet to the equipment vendor. The bitcoin transfer was to prove that she lived in the area before any laptop was sent.\n\nUltimately, she lost her $500 and realized the job was as phony as can be.\n\nIncreasingly, unsuspecting consumers are being directed to a bitcoin ATM somewhere in the city or suburbs and told by convincing con artists how to convert that cash into cryptocurrency. Maybe it starts with a story about needing to pay an overdue utility bill. Maybe it's someone pretending to be from Apple Support. Maybe it's a hot prospect you met on an online dating site who turns out to be a crypto cad.\n\nMaybe it's part of a new attractive — but phony — job offer.\n\nThe scammers tell elaborate tales to convince you that grabbing a fistful of cash and walking up to a bitcoin ATM is absolutely the right thing to do.\n\nJust a few years ago, it might have been far tougher to run this sort of a scam when there were far fewer kiosks across the country.\n\nNow, more than 38,500 cryptocurrency kiosks, often known as bitcoin ATMs, are up and running in the U.S., up from roughly 4,000 at the start of 2019, according to data from Coin ATM Radar.\n\nThe cryptocurrency ATM could be at a liquor store, a laundromat, a shopping mall, a gas station or grocery. It's as easy as putting cash on a gift card but many consumers who have heard all the warnings about gift card scams aren't aware that a bitcoin ATM is just as handy for crooks.\n\n\"Crypto transfers can’t be reversed,\" the Federal Trade Commission stated in a warning. \"Once the money’s gone, there’s no getting it back.\"\n\nA $350,000 bitcoin scam\n\nThis summer, an elderly couple in northern Michigan lost $350,000 in a shocking bitcoin scam, according to a July report by the Grand Traverse County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe couple — the man, 76, and the woman, 87 — had received a phone call that allegedly was from \"Apple Support\" and claimed to be a scam alert.\n\nThe scammers who were impersonating Apple convinced the couple that they needed to send money, repeatedly.\n\nThe couple reportedly withdrew money from different banks to turn cash into cryptocurrency via a CoinFlip platform. Some money was sent via bitcoin ATMs; the rest was through wire transfers, according to Lt. Brandon Brinks, who worked on the case for the Grand Traverse Sheriff’s Department.\n\n\"That money is gone,\" Brinks told the Free Press in September, noting that the case has no leads.\n\nCoinFlip operates more than 3,000 bitcoin ATMs in 48 states, including Michigan. The Chicago-based crypto company also offers ways to buy digital currency with bank wire transfers, credit cards and debit cards.\n\nA representative for CoinFlip said the company cannot discuss specific customer transactions due to privacy concerns.\n\nIn a statement the company said CoinFlip takes \"strict preventative and proactive measures to protect our customers, including clear scam warnings that customers view prior to each transaction. We have 24-hour customer support and customers can call us to ask questions. Our customer support reps are trained to spot potential frauds and actively warn customers.\"\n\nI found this CoinFlip warning online as part of its How to use a bitcoin ATM post: “Have you been sent to this ATM to make a payment for ANYTHING, such as SSN fraud, taxes, utility bills, tickets, cars, equipment, money transfers, ransom, bail, eBay, Airbnb, or anything odd? STOP! You are being scammed, hang up and call us at 877-757-2646.”\n\nMany say they didn't see any warnings on kiosks\n\nMany people who lost money say they never saw any warning when walking up to a bitcoin ATM.\n\nHalushka said she didn't spot any scam alerts on the bitcoin ATM where she handed over $500. I didn't see any, either, when I visited the same ATM at the liquor store. I later visited an ATM in the same network at a metro Detroit gas station and did not see a warning sign early in the process, either. The first few slides on the screen ask you how much crypto you want to buy — $1 to $999 or $1,000 to $2,999 or $3,000 to $15,000. Before you can do anything else, you must submit your mobile number. I did not attempt to buy bitcoin.\n\nSome outfits have warnings at kiosks, like: \"Do not send bitcoin to anyone you do not know for eBay or to buy a car. It is more than likely a scam.\"\n\nWhy a QR code is a clue to a scam\n\nThe bitcoin ATM scam has a handful of key features: Imposters, a fake reason for why you need to withdraw cash, instructions on where to drive to find that ATM and QR codes. Scammers pretend to be someone reputable and convince you that you need to withdraw money out of your bank or retirement account.\n\nThe fraudsters direct you to an ATM in your community where you can put that cash into the kiosk.\n\nThe scammers will use your ZIP code to go online to find a cryptocurrency ATM in your area and then suggest that you go there, according to Amy Nofziger, director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network, said.\n\nTypically, Nofziger said, criminals send a bitcoin QR code to their victims to use at the the crypto machine. When you scan that code, you're sending that money into digital wallet held by the crooks.\n\n“You’re essentially putting the money you put into your own wallet into their wallet and it’s gone,” Nofziger said.\n\nAnother warning: After your money is gone, the AARP warns, some crooks even claim to be able to recover the money you lost in a crypto scam — triggering yet another way to scam people out of more money.\n\n$1B lost to crypto scams\n\nTens of thousands of consumers nationwide reported losing more than $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency to scams from the start of 2021 through June 2022, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, consumers reported losing $653 million to crypto fraud. By comparison, $680 million was reported lost for all of 2021.\n\nAccording to FTC data, $785 million was lost from January 2021 through June 22 to investment-related crypto scams. And $220 million was lost in crypto fraud in romance scams, $121 million to fraudsters impersonating a business and $56 million to crooks impersonating a government entity and demanding digital currency. The figures are based on fraud reports to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network indicating that cryptocurrency was used as the payment method.\n\nThe number of fraud reports exploded from 1,300 in 2018 to 33,700 last year where crypto was used as payment. In the first six months of 2022, cryptocurrency-related fraud reports already hit 25,000.\n\nCryptocurrency scams rose to the second riskiest scam type in 2021 — online purchases were No. 1 — based on a reported increase in both exposure and susceptibility to the scam, according to a report by the Better Business Bureau. Crypto scams ranked No. 7 in 2020. More than 66% of people reported losing money when targeted by a crypto-related scam type.\n\nMany times, we're looking at an investment-related scam where someone says they've found a way to double your money and then scams you out of cash. Some romance scams involve a new love who starts out casually offering tips on how to get into crypto. Experts warn: Never mix online dating with investment advice.\n\nMore:2 Michigan women tricked by convincing, sophisticated Amazon scam: What to know\n\nMore: Zelle scams trick consumers Many lose money when scammers suggest they use the Zelle app\n\nThe cash to crypto scams bank on the notion that we've heard of bitcoin but what we know about digital currency is extremely limited.\n\n\"Bitcoin is used by the fraudsters as many people are still unclear of how it works, so they believe the fraudster,\" said Deidre Davis, chief marketing officer for the Michigan State University Federal Credit Union, which has seen some members hit by bitcoin fraud.\n\nBitcoin ATMS all over the place\n\nThe bitcoin machine might look somewhat like an ATM that we've used for decades. But only some designated bitcoin ATMs will dispense cash.\n\nSam Elyias, owner of the Star Market in Lake Orion, said he has not had complaints about the Cash2Bitcoin ATM at his store, where he leases a spot for it. He does not own the machine. The companies that own the kiosks pitch the space leases as a way for a small business to make passive income, while increasing foot traffic.\n\nElyias, who stopped to talk while reviewing the well-stocked store's extensive inventory in late August, said he, too, is frustrated by scam calls, including a recent one that claimed he owed DTE a $500 deposit to change meters. Those scammers, he recalled, wanted money on gift cards, and suggested that he go to a Dollar General to buy them. He didn't lose any cash because he figured out it was a scam.\n\nCash2Bitcoin's website lists 174 locations in Michigan, including liquor stores and gas stations, plus more than 600 locations in other states.\n\nOther names in the bitcoin universe include: Bitcoin of America, which has more than 2,500 BTM kiosks in 31 states, including Michigan.\n\nBitcoin Depot aims to go public in 2023 and has plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It has more than 140 kiosks in Michigan, including at liquor stores and small markets in Detroit, Hamtramck, Hazel Park and Warren. There's even one listed in a Buffalo Wild Wings in Clinton Township. Bitcoin Depot says it has more than 7,000 ATM locations in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nConsumers must understand that they should only send crypto to a wallet that the consumer controls, according to Brandon Mintz, founder, president and CEO of Bitcoin Depot.\n\nCrypto is trustless, he said in an emailed statement, and does not depend on banks to facilitate transactions.\n\nNo intermediary will stop or reverse the transaction. \"Once it's in someone else's wallet, there's nothing you can do to recover your crypto,\" Mintz stated.\n\nMintz noted that scam warnings are on the company's Bitcoin ATMs, as well as some competitors.\n\nScammers sound way too convincing for some\n\nAfter the fact, the stories that scammers tell admittedly sound convoluted but crooks know how to get you under the ether and suspend critical thinking. Hard-to-trace cryptocurrency only makes it easier for scammers to steal money.\n\nConsumer calls relating to cryptocurrency scams tripled in the past year, according to the AARP Fraud Watch Helpline.\n\nOne victim, who lost nearly $15,000 in a bitcoin ATM scam, received an email from a company about a charge he didn’t make, according to a recent complaint to the AARP Fraud Watch Network. He called that number listed in the email and the person on the line had him hand over access to his computer device to supposedly facilitate a refund.\n\nThe crooks then gained access to the man's bank account and falsely claimed that they had “returned” too much money to him as part of that refund on the bad charge. The solution? He was to deposit the extra money into a bitcoin ATM. He made two transactions and ended up losing nearly $15,000.\n\nA woman was told she was owed a refund of $790 after a mistaken charge to her account. But again, the scammers said they deposited too much — $7,900 supposedly in this case — and the woman ended up using a bitcoin machine as instructed by the scammers to send up to $5,200 to fix the phony problem, according to Nofziger. The woman lost her money.\n\nMartha Cheresh, who was born in metro Detroit but now lives in Santa Monica, California, told the Free Press she spent several hours in early August dealing with upsetting conversations after scammers wove one elaborate story after another.\n\nShe got a call that claimed to be from Amazon customer service. She answered because she had just bought something at Amazon. But the caller didn't talk about her purchase but instead informed Cheresh that she bought an iPhone and earbuds costing more than $1,000 that were being sent to Albany, New York.\n\nSomething she knew she didn't do.\n\nThe conversation soon turned in another direction as more information was given to her and she was transferred from one authority to the next. She was accused of money laundering involving $100,000. She was told that there were drug trafficking allegations against her. She spoke with a man impersonating the Drug Enforcement Administration and then was transferred to an investigator from the Treasury Department.\n\n\"I wasn't questioning any of this at the time,\" she said, pointing out how real it all sounded. \"I was just like putty.\"\n\nThe whole process ran from about that first call at about 11:30 a.m. to roughly 4 p.m. when she was at bitcoin ATM.\n\nIn order to fix to the problems, she was told to withdraw cash from the bank and go to a bitcoin ATM in her area, not far from a store where she shops. The idea was to create some kind of government account that would help prove she wasn't involved in illegal activities.\n\nShe doesn't recall seeing any alerts to consumers about potential scams on that ATM, nothing like you sometimes see now on shelves where retailers sell gift cards.\n\n\"I want to go to all the bitcoin machines and put a warning on the side,\" said Cheresh, a retired teacher.\n\nCheresh lost $4,900.\n\n\"They get you with fear,\" she said. \"Fear can make you foggy.\"\n\nFlint woman rebuilds her savings after bitcoin ATM scam\n\nA woman in the Flint area lost $4,500 in late April after fraudsters convincd her to withdraw cash from her bank and send money via a bitcoin ATM at a gas station.\n\nTaylor Inman, 26, was told initially that an iPhone or a MacBook Pro, she can't remember which, was bought using her credit for $995 and then was being sent to Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThen somehow the conversation with the caller turned, and she supposedly was transferred to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Somehow her identity and Social Security number, she was told, were used in a money laundering scam.\n\n\"They had opened five different bank accounts around the U.S.,\" she said.\n\nAnd the scammers told her that now she needed to send money through a bitcoin ATM as part of a complex process to clear her name. She wasn't going to lose a dime, supposedly. It was part of a way to freeze her credit and get a new Social Security number. But she was told she could not tell anyone.\n\nThe scammers told her where to find the bitcoin ATM at a gas station nearby.\n\n\"I was putting the money in the machine thinking and hoping I was going to get it back,\" Inman said \"I didn't think it was a scam. They are very convincing people. They already know what to say.\"\n\nInman called her boyfriend to meet her at the ATM gas station to bring her a water. He tried to tell her it was a scam. He called 911 and they told her it was a scam, she said. But it was too late. The money was gone.\n\n\"I didn't know that bitcoin is pretty much untraceable,\" she said.\n\nShe packages car parts at the NorthGate factory in Flint and has been rebuilding her savings by working as much as possible.\n\n\"The thing that people need to know is nobody is ever going to call you asking for money, saying you have to do this and this and this,\" Inman said. \"It's just a scam.\"\n\nIt can sound so official even to a 'techie'\n\nHalushka's contact for that so-called job offer knew how to make things sound official and even sent her an employment contract in advance. Family members and friends reviewed it and told her it looked like the real deal.\n\nThe idea of sending money via a bitcoin ATM sounded somewhat convincing as a possible way to prove that she lived in the area she said she did. You can't be sending laptops and other equipment somewhere else, after all.\n\nShe drove roughly 15 miles one way to the liquor store to use that bitcoin ATM. She was given a QR code as part of the process. The so-called representative at the company walked her through what seemed to be a fairly complicated process to send cash via bitcoin.\n\n\"They gave me step by step instructions,\" Halushka said.\n\nShe said goodbye to the five $100 bills, got back in her car and thought somehow really, this wasn't right.\n\n\"The whole thing was very weird,\" she said.\n\nSure, she thought she was sending back $500 of their money.\n\nBut everything just didn't add up. The job opening just showed up one day in her email. The main job interview was done via a RingCentral messaging app over roughly three hours. She didn't talk with anyone until she asked to do so. Even then, the phone conversation was short and the man's voice was kind of muffled.\n\n\"The offer letter was for way more than I was expecting,\" she said, noting that it would pay $45 an hour. But then again, she had family members look at the offer and they seemed to think it was OK.\n\nYet this crypto wallet and bitcoin thing?\n\n\"Something was off,\" she said.\n\nWhen Halushka got home to her family's house in Oakland Township, she decided to call the company, Radius Health — which was listed as Radius Healthcare on that first email that she received out of the blue.\n\nNo such job existed, she was told on the phone by someone at the real Radius Health. Halushka recalled the woman saying: \"Don't do anything else. That's a scam. We're not offering that position right now.\"\n\nBy Googling Radius Healthcare after the fact, you'd spot some scam alerts online about this being a fake company.\n\nHalushka could have been out thousands of dollars had the scam been allowed to continue. The scammers wanted her to keep sending more money, given the size of that $6,548 fake check, and turned extremely aggressive when she flat out told them via message that she knew this was a scam.\n\n\"You are a theif,\" the scammer typed, spelling thief incorrectly. \"You want to keep the money. I'll f--- you up big time.\"\n\nThe bank eventually determined that the check that was sent was fake — and Halushka was out the $500 but that was all. The check itself was supposedly issued by a Brandon Clark of Union, Mississippi. (A name that oddly enough appears online as part of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement narcotics investigation in Mississippi.)\n\n\"I had never heard of any employment scam up until now,\" Halushka said.\n\nHalushka, who was targeted by scammers in early August, still cannot believe that she never heard of how crooks track resumes posted on job search sites, target those who need work and then use fake checks that ultimately bounce to trick consumers out of their cash.\n\nShe had no idea that a bitcoin ATM could cause trouble; she knows of a relative who lost money buying Target gift cards in one scam.\n\n\"I consider myself a techie,\" she said. \"Every single year, they're getting more and more crafty.\"\n\nShe still shakes her head — and hopes that somehow she can get her money back — when she thinks of driving to a store in a neighborhood that she had never been in before.\n\n\"Why am I going to this sketchy liquor store?\" she asked, long after her money was gone.\n\nContactSusan Tompor via stompor@freepress.com.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n1. Help, help, I’m stuck here\n\nHere’s an all-too-common trope: A scammer pretends to a family member or friend, claiming to be stuck somewhere and in need of money. One of the most common examples of this is the “grandparent scam,” in which a thief impersonates an older person’s grandchild and claims to be saddled with an expensive repair bill or even stuck in jail.\n\nIn this case, you may hear from a close contact who says they are stuck in Ukraine or Russia. Maybe they need money for a plane ticket out or claim to have lost their passport. They’ll raise the stakes, too, telling you they got robbed or all the banks are closed.\n\nThe scariest part is how easy it is to manipulate photos to back this up. A clever criminal can easily show your loved one in the Ukraine or Russia to make you believe it. Always check in with your loved one through another means of communication. For example, if they are texting, send an email or, better yet, give them a call.\n\nSPOT THE FAKES: How to tell if a photo has been manipulated\n\n2. We need your support now more than ever\n\nIn times of crisis, we turn to others for help or step up to assist. You need to be extra-vigilant about donating money to GoFundMe pages or other relief efforts right now. Scammers use our kindest instincts against us to steal money through fake aid campaigns.\n\nIf you are donating money through an organization like the American Red Cross, for example, be sure you’re on the actual Red Cross site and not a cleverly disguised phishing site. It’s easy to copy the look of a website and steal official logos. The real tipoff is the URL.

But it looks and sounds SO real\n\nToday's deepfake technology makes it easier than you'd believe in producing high-quality videos or audio clips of a public figure saying or doing something that never happened in real life.\n\nAs you encounter videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other political figures on social media or YouTube, keep your guard up. If the video is designed to make you angry or act in some way, it very well may be a disinformation campaign at work.\n\nRemember, disinformation videos are designed to look natural. It's not uncommon for these videos to use computer-generated image technology and paid actors.\n\nTap or click here to listen to my podcast on how the lies that spread on social media can change history.\n\n4. I have money, lots of money\n\nThis one is a twist on the old Nigerian Prince scams. Someone with a lot of money needs to move that money to leave the country – but they can’t do it without your help. Of course, you’ll need to pay transfer fees. If you receive such a message, report it as spam and delete it.\n\nScam texts aren’t just annoying.

I can show you how to time the market\n\nIn times of strife, there’s always someone looking to make a buck. The stock market and cryptocurrency are down, and that presents an opportunity – at least that’s what a crook wants you to believe. The same goes for pitches you get to invest in stocks from cybersecurity companies to ammunition.\n\nHere’s the truth: Anyone that who reaches out to you unsolicited with financial advice is in it to make money themselves.\n\n6. If I could just give my loved one a proper burial\n\nThe funeral scam surfaces during national tragedies, natural disasters and wartime: Pleas for money to bury deceased family members or money for plane tickets to attend a funeral. It’s easy to see why people fall for this ploy.\n\nEmotions take over, and you want to help. Treat emails or other communications with caution, and don’t send money directly to someone you don’t know through a payment app or website.\n\n7. I’m defending your freedom\n\nFraudsters won't just play on your emotions to help others. They will appeal to your sense of patriotism too. Think twice if you hear from someone claiming to be an American soldier stuck in Ukraine.\n\nThe American service personnel con may ask you for money, help get a message to their family, or supplies. Similarly, these requests can come from someone claiming to be a Ukrainian or Russian soldier too.\n\nRELATED: 5 silly mistakes putting your online privacy and security at huge risk\n\n8. Do as I say or else\n\nCybercriminals often use urgency to push us to make bad decisions. When you’re feeling flustered, you may do things you wouldn’t in a calmer state. That’s why phony calls threatening jail time from the IRS work so well.\n\nThat's also why fake emails or calls from your boss or a higher-up at your company work too. They almost always have an urgent tone, asking you to send money or information right now.\n\nIf you receive an unusual request, contact this person in another way to verify the request.\n\n9. It looks so legit\n\nGas prices are going up, and you can bet fake sites and apps that tell you where the lowest gas prices are in your area will be coming out of the woodwork. Don’t trust anything new that pops up.\n\nInstead, go with an established option you can trust. I like Waze and GasBuddy for this purpose. Tap or click here for a direct download link for GasBuddy and steps on how to use it.\n\n10. I will love you until the end of time\n\nRomance scams are incredibly effective. The FBI says victims of romance fraud lost $1 billion in 2021 – and that's just what was reported. Why do they work so well?\n\nWhen we’re falling in love or just attracted to someone, our defenses are down. We don’t want to believe that a beautiful woman or charming man isn’t who they say they are.\n\nBe on the watch for anyone who tells you they need to leave Ukraine or Russia immediately because of the war, and they want to build a new life with you. This scammer will send you photos, videos and even start sexting with you. Then, the money requests start for food, rent, and airline tickets to come to see you.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’re exhausted, your body yawning for sleep. Yet once your head hits the pillow, your mind is flooded with worry, making sleep elusive, at times impossible.\n\nDon’t fret, experts say: There are relaxation techniques you can use to calm that racing mind.\n\n“Think of these relaxation exercises as tools in your tool kit for better sleep,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Practice them, and you’ll get better and better at falling asleep, which is the holy grail, right? No one wants to spend time tossing and turning at night.”\n\n1. Controlled deep breathing\n\nDeep breathing is a science-backed method of calming the body and mind that can be done easily before you get into bed and when you wake during the middle of the night.\n\nChanging the rhythm of your breath slows your heart rate, reduces blood pressure and stimulates the body’s parasympathetic “rest and digest” system, which can take worry and anxiety offline.\n\n“Consciously focusing on the breath can help you separate yourself from the darting thoughts that fly through your brain,” Robbins said.\n\nThere are a number of deep breathing techniques you can try. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, focuses on relaxing the diaphragm, the main muscle of respiration. Start by taking a deep breath through your nose to a slow count of six, making sure that you can feel your stomach rise with your hand as it fills with air. Count to six again as you let the breath slowly escape.\n\n“Strive for effortless inhales that are soft and soundless while treating your exhales like gentle, extended sighs of relief,” suggested CNN contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach.\n\nStay in the moment, Santas said, by focusing on the sounds and sensations of your breath: “Direct all of your senses to follow the path of air in through your nose, down your throat, into your lungs and out again. If your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath, happening in the here and now.”\n\n2. Meditation\n\nMeditation is a centuries-old method of calming the body and the mind. Studies show it can help perfectionists stop judging themselves and can assist in the treatment of smoking, pain, addictive disorders and depression, among others.\n\nUsing direct measures of brain function and structure, one study found it only took 30 minutes a day of meditation practice over the course of two weeks to produce a measurable change in the brain.\n\n“When these kinds of mental exercises are taught to people, it actually changes the function and the structure of their brain,” neuroscientist Richard Davidson, professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\nThere are many resources on the internet to help someone begin to meditate. Davidson and his colleagues have created a free, science-based app designed to help people practice meditation and mindfulness.\n\n3. Visualization\n\nVisualization is another sleep aid. Picture a calm and peaceful spot in your mind’s eye and fill it with specific objects, colors and sounds. Researchers have found that people who visualize in detail were able to push unwelcome thoughts more successfully from their minds.\n\nIf you have trouble populating the scene, the researchers suggest asking yourself questions about smell, touch and light, such as “Can I feel the sun on my skin? What do I smell in the air?”\n\nYou can also visualize your body relaxing, experts say. While breathing deeply and slowly, imagine your breath is a wind coursing through the body, easing stress and relaxing tension as it moves through each part of the body and then escapes.\n\n“I like to think of the breath as a light in your mind’s eye that grows when you inhale and gets smaller as you exhale,” Robbins said. “Those tangible strategies where you visualize something and match that to a breath are really powerful.”\n\n4. Progressive muscle relaxation\n\nMost of us aren’t even aware of how much tension we carry in our muscles until it shows up in backaches and headaches.\n\nProgressive muscle relaxation is a way of relaxing those muscles, thus making it easier to fall asleep, experts say. You tense and release muscle groups in the body in a certain order, starting at the head and working your way down to the toes and feet.\n\nEach section of the body is tightly tensed and held for 10 seconds as you breathe in. Strive to squeeze each muscle hard, but not to the point of cramping or pain. Then, as you breathe out, relax the muscle suddenly and all at once. University of Michigan Health recommends you do the exercises in a systematic order that you can find here.\n\nThere’s an added benefit to the exercise, experts say: There’s no room in your brain for anxious thoughts.\n\n5. Set up a ‘worry time’ before bed\n\nHere’s a way to stop your mind from repetitively listing all the things you need to do (or haven’t done), but it only works if you do it before you hit the sack.\n\n“Don’t worry in bed. Schedule a ‘worry time’ – a period of time outside of the bedroom, outside of sleep, to worry about the things that naturally creep in your mind at night,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“Write down a list of things you need to do tomorrow,” suggested Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, a professor of medicine and director of sleep research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n“You can even email it to yourself. It gives you satisfaction and the realization that it is night and there’s nothing you can do with your list, but you can attend to it tomorrow,” Polotsky said.\n\nAll these mental tricks and relaxation tips serve a purpose beyond that night’s sleep, experts say.\n\n“They are extremely beneficial from a classical conditioning standpoint,” Robbins said. “If your body knows what comes after the end of these activities is sleep, then you start to condition yourself, and after a bit of time, your body will more easily slip into a state of relaxation, which increases your chances of sleep.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/us/ryan-last-suicide-sextortion-california", "title": "A 17-year-old boy died by suicide hours after being scammed.

Immediately after Ryan shared an intimate photo of his own, the cybercriminal demanded $5,000, threatening to make the photo public and send it to Ryan’s family and friends.\n\nRyan Last. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nThe San Jose, California, teen told the cybercriminal he could not pay the full amount, and the demand was ultimately lowered to a fraction of the original figure – $150. But after paying the scammers from his college savings, Stuart said, “They kept demanding more and more and putting lots of continued pressure on him.”\n\nAt the time, Stuart knew none of what her son was experiencing. She learned the details after law enforcement investigators reconstructed the events leading up to his death.\n\nShe had said goodnight to Ryan at 10 p.m., and described him as her usually happy son. By 2 a.m., he had been scammed, and taken his life. Ryan left behind a suicide note describing how embarrassed he was for himself and the family.\n\n“He really, truly thought in that time that there wasn’t a way to get by if those pictures were actually posted online,” Pauline said. “His note showed he was absolutely terrified. No child should have to be that scared.”\n\nLaw enforcement calls the scam “sextortion,” and investigators have seen an explosion in complaints from victims leading the FBI to ramp up a campaign to warn parents from coast to coast.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback An inside look at sextortion (2017) 02:19 - Source: CNN An inside look at sextortion (2017) 02:19\n\nThe bureau says there were over 18,000 sextortion-related complaints in 2021, with losses in excess of $13 million. The FBI says the use of child pornography by criminals to lure suspects also constitutes a serious crime.\n\nThe investigation into Last’s case is ongoing, Stuart and the FBI tell CNN.\n\n“To be a criminal that specifically targets children – it’s one of the more deeper violations of trust I think in society,” says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dan Costin, who leads a team of investigators working to counter crimes against children.\n\nAccording to Costin, many of the sextortion scams reported to the FBI are determined to be from criminals on the African continent and in Southeast Asia. Federal investigators are working with their law enforcement counterparts around the world, Costin said, to help identify and arrest perpetrators who are targeting kids online.\n\nRyan Last and his mother, Pauline Stuart. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nOne challenge for the FBI: many victims of sextortion do not report the incidents to law enforcement.\n\n“The embarrassment piece of this is probably one of the bigger hurdles that the victims have to overcome,” said Costin. “It can be a lot, especially in that moment.”\n\nBut investigators urge victims to quickly contact law enforcement, either online or at their local FBI field office.\n\nMedical experts say there’s a key reason why young males are especially vulnerable to sextortion-related scams.\n\n“Teen brains are still developing,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General in Boston. “So when something catastrophic happens, like a personal picture is released to people online, it’s hard for them to look past that moment and understand that in the big scheme of things they’ll be able to get through this.”\n\nHadland said there are steps parents can take to help safeguard their kids from online harm.\n\n“The most important thing that a parent should do with their teen is try to understand what they’re doing online,” she said. “You want to know when they’re going online, who they’re interacting with, what platforms they’re using. Are they being approached by people that they don’t know, are they experiencing pressure to share information or photos?”\n\nHadland said it’s also critical that parents specifically warn teens of scams like sextortion, without shaming them.\n\n“You want to make it clear that they can talk to you if they have done something, or they feel like they’ve made a mistake,” he said.\n\nRyan’s mom agrees.\n\n“You need to talk to your kids because we need to make them aware of it,” Stuart said.\n\nStill grieving the loss of her son, she is channeling her family’s pain into action, and honoring Ryan by speaking out and telling his story. She hopes that doing so will help save lives.\n\n“How could these people look at themselves in the mirror knowing that $150 is more important than a child’s life?” she says. “There’s no other word but ‘evil’ for me that they care much more about money than a child’s life. I don’t want anybody else to go through what we did.”", "authors": ["Josh Campbell Jason Kravarik", "Josh Campbell", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955716/nuclear-fusion", "title": "The latest nuclear fusion breakthrough explained | The Week", "text": "US government scientists have reportedly made a major breakthrough in the race to develop practical nuclear fusion – the process that promises “limitless, zero-carbon power”.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that a successful experiment at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has for the first time produced a net energy gain in a “fusion reaction” – which is what powers the Sun.\n\nThis “milestone” is a major step to help “prove the process could provide a reliable, abundant alternative to fossil fuels and conventional nuclear energy”, said the paper, citing three people with knowledge of the preliminary results.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Nuclear fission currently creates waste that can remain radioactive – and therefore potentially dangerous – for tens of thousands of years. After Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, radioactive material leaked into the atmosphere and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn contrast, operating the power plants of the future with fusion would produce only very small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste.\n\nIt is the “holy grail” of clean energy, congressman Don Beyer said earlier this year at the launch of a new White House fusion power strategy, adding: “Fusion has the potential to lift more citizens of the world out of poverty than anything since the invention of fire.”\n\nWith the world wrestling with sky-high energy prices and the need to rapidly move away from burning fossil fuels to halt global warming, “the technology’s potential is hard to ignore”, said the FT, even though “many scientists believe fusion power stations are still decades away”.\n\nWhen could it be used?\n\nThere’s “huge uncertainty” about this, wrote the BBC’s environment analyst Roger Harrabin, but it won’t be any time soon.\n\nOne estimate suggests “maybe 20 years”, he said, but even then fusion would “need to scale up, which would mean a delay of perhaps another few decades”.\n\nTherefore, it probably won’t be until the middle of the century that this form of power becomes at all commonplace. The European Fusion Development Agreement has established a goal of bringing fusion electricity to the grid by 2050, said World Nuclear News.\n\nThe design for fusion was first proposed by Russian scientists in 1950, and the process has become so protracted that a joke in nuclear fusion circles states that a working reactor has been 20 years away ever since then.\n\nWhat about the latest breakthrough?\n\nScientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California are believed to have produced a net energy gain in a fusion reaction for the first time.\n\nThe lab uses a process called inertial confinement fusion that involves bombarding a tiny pellet of hydrogen plasma with the world’s biggest laser. Data from the experiment is still be analysed, said the FT, but the reaction produced about 2.5 megajoules of energy, which was about 120% of the 2.1 megajoules of energy in the lasers.\n\n“If this is confirmed, we are witnessing a moment of history,” said Dr Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist, told the FT. “Scientists have struggled to show that fusion can release more energy than is put in since the 1950s, and the researchers at Lawrence Livermore seem to have finally and absolutely smashed this decades-old goal.”\n\nEarlier this year scientists at an Oxfordshire lab recreated the way the Sun works to make 59 megajoules of energy – more than double the amount achieved in similar tests back in 1997.\n\n“This is not a massive energy output,” noted the BBC in February – “only enough to boil about 60 kettles’ worth of water”. However, scientists described the results as a significant moment in the quest for clean and reliable power.\n\nThe “landmark results” have “taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientific and engineering challenges of them all”, said Professor Ian Chapman, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Agency, which co-funds and operates JET.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/961627/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-14-july-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 14 July 2023 | The Week", "text": "1.

The prime minister warned that his offer of a 6% pay rise this year was final and that “no amount of strikes” would change his mind. Public service workers in England have been offered 5%-7% rises but departments must fund them from existing budgets.

A spokesperson for the former prime minister said Johnson wishes to cooperate with the inquiry and did not deny being unable to recall the code. Johnson stopped using the handset in 2021, after it emerged his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years. Andrew Whaley, an expert in cybersecurity, dismissed Johnson’s passcode claim, telling Sky News it was a “pretty lame excuse” and that “accessing the data would take minutes”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

NHS dentistry shortage\n\nAn inquiry has reported that the pain and distress of not being able to see an NHS dentist are “totally unacceptable”. The review was launched after the BBC found nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients and that some people drove hundreds of miles for treatment or pulled out their own teeth. The government said it invests more than £3bn a year in dentistry but the report, by the Commons’ Health and Social Care Committee, said declining levels of NHS dentistry should be “sounding alarm bells”.\n\nThe crisis in dentistry: why has finding an NHS dentist become so difficult?\n\n4. Hollywood actors walk out\n\nHollywood actors will join an ongoing strike by screenwriters in the industry’s biggest shutdown for more than 60 years. The Screen Actors Guild wants streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions. The industrial action means most US film and TV productions will grind to a halt. Picket lines “are likely to be raucous and star-studded spectacles”, said the New York Times, with “struggling thespians still trying to get a foothold” next to “A-listers with bodyguards who get paid $20 million or more per movie role.”\n\nScreenwriters on strike: Hollywood grinds to a halt\n\n5. UK’s China policy scrutinised\n\nThe UK’s approach to a “whole of state” assault by China on its economy, politics, civil infrastructure and academia is inadequate, according to a parliamentary committee. The all-party intelligence and security committee found that Beijing was aggressively targeting the UK, and “without swift and decisive action”, China could become an existential threat to liberal democratic systems. The Guardian said that “short-termism and inconsistency” have plagued the UK’s policy on China.\n\nChina: the new rules of engagement for Britain\n\n6. Cat coronavirus could hit UK\n\nExperts have warned that an outbreak of feline coronavirus that has killed thousands of cats in Cyprus could spread to Britain. Vets on the island have reported an “alarming increase” in cases of feline infectious peritonitis. Animal rights groups said that the virus had killed 300,000 cats on the island this year. Following evidence that the virus has spread to Turkey, Lebanon and Israel, Professor Danièlle Gunn-Moore, a specialist in feline medicine, told The Times “if this virus gets to the UK it could cause many of our cats to die”.\n\n7. IMF warns of ‘scars’ from pandemic\n\nThe disruption caused to education by the Covid pandemic will hold back economic growth for years, said the International Monetary Fund. The IMF blamed the impact of lockdowns on schooling for the weakest outlook for global economic growth in decades. “Scars from the pandemic, including to students’ learning and [skill training], could weigh on economies for years to come,” said the Washington-based group.\n\n8. BBC investigated Edwards\n\nBBC reporters were investigating allegations about Huw Edwards before The Sun published its story. According to Deadline, Newsnight’s Victoria Derbyshire and other BBC colleagues were secretly preparing a potential story days before the tabloid ran its claim last week that Edwards had paid £35,000 to a young person in exchange for images. BBC reporters are now thought to be working on further potential stories about Edwards. However, one colleague described it as “surreal” that one BBC News presenter would investigate another.\n\nHuw Edwards named as presenter at centre of BBC crisis\n\n9. Truss has highest hourly rate\n\nLiz Truss is paid £15,770 an hour for second jobs, revealed Sky News. MPs with second jobs have an average wage of £233 per hour -17 times the national average and over 22 higher than the minimum hourly wage. Former prime minister Truss, who has the highest hourly rate for a current MP, was paid at a rate of £20,000 per hour - nearly 1,500 times the UK average hourly wage - for a speech in Taiwan. Boris Johnson, who resigned as an MP last month, has an hourly rate of £21,822.\n\nWhat will Liz Truss do next?\n\n10. Airport with highest crime rate revealed\n\nHumberside Airport was the UK airport with the highest crime rate in 2022, according to an analysis of Freedom of Information data. It had 9.7 crimes per 100,000 passengers, although this only amounted to a total of nine crimes.

The source requested anonymity because of the criminal investigation.\n\nNonprofit accountability can be a 'fundamental problem'\n\nThe nonprofit developing 5½ miles of the frontage along the Detroit River had $169 million in assets in 2022 and receives significant public money. Direct government grants to the organization totaled at least $15 million over the past decade, according to a Free Press review of tax filing records, and the city of Detroit provides $3 million per year for operational costs, though the total public contribution to the Conservancy’s initiatives is likely far higher.\n\nNonprofits and philanthropies play an outsized role in providing public services in tax-poor Detroit. The city famously exited bankruptcy more than a decade ago after 12 foundations committed $366 million to help preserve city pensions while preventing the sale of the Detroit Institute of Arts collection in what is known as the Grand Bargain.\n\nReliance on nonprofits to handle public business can present a “fundamental problem” for accountability, said Nicolas Duquette, a University of Southern California professor who researches policies affecting charitable giving.\n\nUnlike in government, there are no elected or appointed officials who can be voted out or pushed out by the public if malfeasance or mismanagement comes to light, and public information rules to promote transparency don’t apply.\n\nUnlike in business, where there's an expected return on investment, there’s no similar financial incentive to root out fraud in nonprofits, Duquette said.\n\n“With a nonprofit, the board responsible for its governance and operations reappoints itself and chooses its own members in perpetuity, and so oversight from beyond that board has to come from some other mechanism than an owner or an election,” said Duquette.\n\nState attorneys general have the power to sue and investigate bad actors in the sector, and the Internal Revenue Service can audit organizations and pull their tax benefit, but both are resource-strapped and rarely do, experts said.\n\nIn extreme cases of negligence, Duquette said, board members could be held personally liable to compensate the organization, but cautioned that larger organizations would likely have insurance protection.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s Office said it has no current or past investigations into the Conservancy and had not received complaints about it.\n\nAsked whether it plans to open an investigation on its own, spokesman Danny Wimmer said the office had “not reviewed the matter to assess the necessity of a parallel investigation or prosecution of potential state law violations or whether such an undertaking would substantiate a viable expense of department resources given the ongoing federal case.”\n\nThe IRS’s criminal division said it could not confirm or deny whether it is conducting its own investigation, but typically gets involved only in cases of alleged tax evasion. A spokesman for the civil side of the agency declined comment, citing privacy rules.\n\nBloated board, questions about controls\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Smith had sole access to one of the nonprofit’s online bank accounts, and presented its accountant with falsified paper-only bank statements four times per year in person in a Honey Baked Ham parking lot 40 miles from the city. He also took out a $5 million line of credit in 2023 with paperwork that was allegedly forged to hide the Conservancy’s cash flow problems, the feds say.\n\nBetween 2012 and this year, he is accused of stealing $24.4 million via wire transfers to one of his companies and nearly $15 million in credit card payments for he and his family members, purchasing “airline tickets, hotels, limousines, household goods, lawn care, clothing, and jewelry,\" according to a criminal complaint.\n\nTo limit corruption, nonprofits typically require more than one person to sign checks and approve expenses, experts said. Two sources familiar with the situation at the Conservancy said such rules were in place for transactions over $500, but may have been flouted.\n\nFederal law does not mandate nonprofit management structures, operational policies or administrative practices, but “an organization with this amount of money should have been following the best practices, obviously,” said Joan Harrington, assistant director of social sector ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.\n\nAnother problem experts flagged: a too-large governing board Duquette called “just ridiculous,” that ran the risk of members being unclear on duties or assuming someone else would handle them.\n\n“You had too many people who were not upholding their responsibility in this situation,” Alexandra Graddy-Reed, another University of Southern California public policy professor focused on nonprofits, said when briefed by the Free Press on details.\n\n“And then the board ... clearly didn’t look too deeply at any of the documentation … so it seems to me that the board was not doing their job.”\n\nHarrington noted, however, that it may have been hard for board members to take action, “because if they have bad information that isn’t recognizable as bad information what can they do?”\n\nBoard members don't receive a salary. Smith's total compensation was $242,000 in 2022, according to IRS records.\n\nThe Conservancy did also appear to have some controls in place to avoid fraud, at least on paper. Its federal tax filing (form 990) shows separate board committees to review audits and finances and a conflict of interest policy.\n\nHowever, experts said there can be a disconnect between intention and execution.\n\n“You can have every policy written down in your governing documents, but if no one is enforcing them and there’s no monitoring then there’s no accountability,” said Graddy-Reed.\n\nThe Free Press reported last week there were warnings about Smith as early as 2021, in court records detailing soured restaurant deals, an indicted business partner and losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars from Smith’s personal business dealings.\n\nBoard members facilitate loans\n\nBefore Smith was accused of embezzling $40 million from the nonprofit where he was CFO, he approached a firm run by the very people tasked with holding him accountable with a personal business pitch. In 2023, Smith wanted $3 million to open a cigar bar — called Discretion — just steps from the Conservancy’s RiverWalk.\n\nHe sought a loan from Invest Detroit, a nonprofit whose board, like the Conservancy’s, is led by businessman Matt Cullen, and whose CEO is also a Conservancy board member.\n\nSmith’s Biltmore Development Group won the property and approval to develop from the Economic Development Corporation of Detroit — a public body governed by mayoral appointees — after offering $500,000 for it in a bidding process in 2019.\n\nCity council — where Riverfront Conservancy board member Mary Sheffield serves as president — unanimously approved a $12 million tax incentive for the project in September 2022.\n\nInvest Detroit, whose CEO is also Riverfront Conservancy board member Dave Blaszkiewicz, approved $3 million in loans for Biltmore in April 2023, property records show. It's not clear from records how much of that Smith's company ultimately received.\n\nThe move positioned Smith to financially benefit from the work of his nonprofit, in what Harrington, the Santa Clara professor, said represents a potential conflict of interest. She added Smith's business pitch should have triggered a closer examination of Smith's personal businesses dealings by the Conservancy board.\n\nIt’s not clear whether disclosures were made because Invest Detroit’s activities aren’t public, and nonprofits aren’t subject to open records laws.\n\nSheffield did not immediately respond to a request for comment and an Invest Detroit spokesman declined comment on behalf of the firm and Blaszkiewicz. A Conservancy spokesman did not answer questions regarding Cullen's role.\n\nBrian Mittendorf, who teaches nonprofit accounting at the Ohio State University, said whether the Conservancy should have flagged the deal as problematic would depend on its conflict of interest policy and whether it had teeth.\n\nHowever, he said, because nonprofits depend on trust to achieve their missions, “actual conflicts and appearances of conflicts are both important to avoid.”\n\nFor Givens Davidson, the business deal reflects too close of a relationship between the organization's governing board and staff.\n\n“You have to look at the governance of the organization as well as the paid leadership and ask yourself is there enough of a separation between the board chair and the staff members so that the board and staff don’t have conflicts of interest,” she said.\n\n“I think there should be that separation and I don’t think it was there and it’s kind of shocking to me,” she said.\n\nIn a December 2021 Facebook post, then-Riverfront Conservancy Executive Director Mark Wallace posted a photo of himself and Smith smiling in front of a Christmas tree with Cullen and four board members, describing them as an “amazing … dream team of community leaders” he considered friends.\n\nWallace resigned May 31. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nOutside auditors stayed too long\n\nExperts told the Free Press the Conservancy also overused an outside auditing firm that may have lacked needed objectivity.\n\nRecords obtained by the Free Press show George Johnson and Co. has reviewed the Conservancy’s finances as far back as 2012 — against industry best practices.\n\nAuditing firms should be switched every three to five years, Harrington said.\n\nWithout fresh eyes, she said audits “almost become a rubber stamp.”\n\n“You come back year after year, you meet with the same people, everything looks the same as it did last year, people might become friendly with each other,” Harrington said.\n\nThe American Institute of CPAs’ code of professional conduct and potential conflicts warns of a “familiarity threat” that can arise when a long-standing or close relationship renders an auditor too sympathetic to a client’s interest.\n\nGeorge Johnson & Co. CEO Anthony McCree defended his work for the Conservancy.\n\n\"I am somewhat limited in what I can say at this time because of the ongoing investigation,\" he said in an email. \"However, George Johnson & Company has complied with all applicable auditing and accounting standards, including maintaining its objectivity and independence. ... It is not unusual for companies to have the same accounting firm performing audits for many years, if not decades.\"\n\nThe auditor should have identified any financial irregularities, including whether statements were falsified, said Harrington.\n\n“They should have at some point had some concerns about the money-in, money-out problem and dug deeper, whether it’s with a call to the bank or a deeper look at the CFO or even saying something to the board chair or audit committee,” she said.\n\nMittendorf, the Ohio State professor, called blanket trust a broader problem across the nonprofit sector.\n\n“In charities we have this overarching phenomenon of they attract people who are really focused on doing good and it creates an environment where there’s lots of trust and not enough healthy skepticism can breed problems,” he said.\n\nFree Press staff writer Gina Kaufman contributed to this report.\n\nContact Violet Ikonomova: vikonomova@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/04/09/why-dover-interfaith-mission-lost-a-federal-grant-for-its-shelter/71853246007/", "title": "Why Dover Interfaith Mission lost a federal grant for its shelter", "text": "A Delaware nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and services to the homeless is in jeopardy of losing public funding amid a myriad of problems including deteriorating buildings, understaffing and asking clients to perform jobs without pay.\n\nThe Delaware State Housing Authority, Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and Dover city code records along with nonprofit board emails and records reviewed by Delaware Online/The News Journal reveal a pattern of problems over the past few years at the Dover faith-based nonprofit Interfaith Mission for Housing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/15/opinion-universities-overregulated-overpriced-intellectually-trapped/504464002/", "title": "Schaffer: Universities are overregulated, overpriced, trapped", "text": "Bob Schaffer\n\nShortly after I acted on my term-limit pledge to relinquish my seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2003, I accepted an invitation to join the governing board of a small Internet-based university accredited by a \"national\" agency. Though I had served on the House Education Committee, I think I learned more about higher education through my service on that little university board than I did during my six years in Congress.\n\nAmerican higher education consists of about 7,000 colleges and universities of all kinds including nonprofit, public, religious, secular, for profit, vocational, liberal arts, research and training institutions. This vast system consists of millions of instructors, students, administrators, alumni and friends; and it represents one of America's greatest strengths — a national culture that values liberty.\n\nUnfortunately, these institutions now find they are ensnared by a system of increasingly intrusive government regimentation. They are overregulated, overpriced, and intellectually trapped by too many perverse incentives. That wasn't always the case.\n\nIn the late 19th Century, colleges and universities organized themselves into six geographic zones that made up the system of regional accreditation. In 1965, during the Lyndon Johnson Administration, the U.S. government created a program of subsidized student loans. Colleges and universities wanting to offer their students access to these loans needed to become accredited by \"Title IV eligible\" accrediting agencies.\n\nToday, all regional, and most \"national\" accrediting agencies are Title IV eligible. There is indeed a distinct connection between the high costs of a college education today and subsidized federal loans, but that is another issue.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI wish to shed light on something more threatening than even high tuition costs — the way the voluntary system of academic accreditation has been transformed into a conveyor belt for the implementation of seemingly endless directives dreamed up by bureaucrats at the U.S Department of Education.\n\nOver the past few years, news reports have highlighted accrediting agencies issuing letters demanding colleges “show cause” as to why they should not lose accreditation. In some cases, accreditors have decided not to renew institutions that had been accredited for many years.\n\nThere have been related lawsuits in federal courts alleging mismanagement of tuition-loan funds by proprietary institutions, allegations of false advertising, high-pressure enrollment of unqualified students, and even denial of transfer of ownership of failing nonprofit colleges to for-profit companies. All these actions were a direct result of regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Education over the past decade.\n\nAs a consequence, accrediting agencies and their member colleges and universities often live in fear of actions by the U.S. government. The small university at which I served, for example, has since been mothballed. That’s too bad. It was a high-quality, low-cost online institution that leveraged the efficiencies of the Internet, and the work of its dedicated instructors to offer a dozen or so degree and certificate programs.\n\nThe little, yet mighty university almost made it thanks to low startup costs, and a low risk of failure. Sadly, one risk could not be controlled — government overregulation.\n\nEspecially in the area of education, the U.S. government has become a leviathan — a behemoth administrative \"state\" creating its own laws and imposing them on individual American citizens, their businesses, and universities without review by any elected official. This is where the heavy hand of state power becomes particularly malicious.\n\nAdministrators of accrediting institutions, who once oversaw a thriving community of voluntary academic associations, now live in fear their charters will be revoked, and their member institutions will no longer be able to offer students access to federal tuition loans and grants.\n\nWhere accreditation agencies once worked tirelessly to assure the academic quality of their members’ programs, their interest in educational quality is today a relatively low priority. Keeping their charter and their members’ access to subsidized, government loans has instead become the first, and sometimes singular imperative.\n\nWhat were once collegial, scholarly institutions, are today docile servants of government regulators, paralyzed by the Inspector General’s very shadow. This is not the land of intellectual liberty that America used to be — ought to be.\n\nGovernment overregulation is the enemy of prudence. Should prudence eventually become banished from American academia, intellectual liberty cannot be far behind.\n\nBob Schaffer is headmaster at Liberty Common School in Fort Collins.

Staff said it formulated the list based on input from the commission, charter officers and the public in recent months.\n\nBut in the end, the commission balked at funding most of the recommendations — at least for now.\n\nThey agreed to hold another special meeting in the future to continue to discuss the items as well as projects they would like to see funded from the federal dollars.\n\nCommissioners did decide to dole out $7 million of the city’s $32.4 million American Rescue Plan Act allocation to nonprofit organizations, which is $5 million more than was proposed to be spent.\n\nNonprofits have been grappling for the funds since they began arriving in Gainesville six months ago, putting forth requests that add up to more than $19 million.\n\nThe commission also voted to allocate $2.9 million of the federal funds to help people fight evictions and for housing rehabilitation and energy-efficiency. And commissioners approved of spending $250,000 to help customers pay off past-due utility debt incurred during the pandemic.\n\nCommissioner Adrian Hayes-Santos wanted the entire list of expenditures proposed by staff — including the east Gainesville clinic, grocery store, and expansion of high-speed internet broadband to 10,000 homes — to be approved. But his motion went nowhere.\n\nHayes-Santos said Tuesday that he is disappointed at how the process seems to be dragging out.\n\n“I don’t think having the money sitting in a big account is a good way to use the money,” he said.\n\nMayor Lauren Poe expressed similar concerns at last Tuesday’s meeting.\n\n“This money does absolutely no good in our bank account,” he said. “I reject the idea that we slow walk this. We need to get this money authorized and into the hands of either our organizations or other organizations to start helping people. People have been suffering for almost two years now.”\n\nPoe said Monday that working with nonprofits can speed up some of the pandemic recovery projects.\n\n“We have so many successful nonprofit agencies already operating in Gainesville that do a lot of the work, and would be able to quickly take that money and deliver the benefits to the community,\" he said.\n\nPoe also said many local nonprofits have been really struggling.\n\n“They were leaned on and we depended on them in a really significant way to help them through the pandemic, and they are still not whole from that,” Poe said.\n\nSome commissioners at last Tuesday's meeting questioned how some projects made the funding list while other ones they had requested did not.\n\nCommissioner Desmon Duncan-Walker, whose district represents east Gainesville, questioned why a $2.25 million allocation was on the list to fund a UF Health urgent care clinic with extended hours of operation on Hawthorne Road.\n\nLast month, the City Commission and Alachua County Commission endorsed the concept of pitching in equal amounts for the facility, with UF Health donating the land. But Walker said she doesn’t recall that being a final decision and she wants a much more comprehensive medical campus project for east Gainesville.\n\n“The most beautiful thing about it is we also have (health care) partners who are willing to bring their resources,” she said.\n\nDuncan-Walker asked City Manager Lee Feldman why her medical campus proposal never made it to the staff list. Feldman said her project would cost $15 million, eating up about half of the overall pot of federal money with no identified ongoing operational costs.\n\n“The commission has already, I thought, directed us to work with UF on their (urgent care) facility,” Feldman said.\n\nOther major projects on the staff list not yet endorsed by commissioners include:\n\n$3.3 million for a community grocery store project at 2302 E. Hawthorne Road;\n\n$9.6 million for extension of high-speed internet to 10,000 homes that includes east Gainesville.\n\nSeveral commissioners say they question now whether the grocery store project is going to come to fruition as they haven't heard back from the developer. In July, the commission authorized staff to enter into contract negotiations.\n\nCommissioner Harvey Ward said Tuesday that’s not a funding issue, as the city could use Gainesville Community Reinvestment Area funds for the grocery project even if the federal pandemic dollars are not allocated.\n\nJacksonville resident Fred Washington, who could not be reached for comment, had proposed a Bravo community supermarket at 2302 E. Hawthorne Road. A Save-A-Lot and Food Lion have opened there, but later closed.\n\nWard said as far as he’s concerned, the commission agreed to fund the urgent care center in east Gainesville, and if pandemic dollars aren’t used, GCRA funds could be. “It’s just a question of which pot do we pay it from?'\" he said.\n\nWard said the expansion of broadband into east Gainesville using the pandemic funds is a question mark.\n\n“I’m going to support that once I see the plan, and we should have the plan back late this month or early next month,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/09/29/icann-iana-internet-address-book-autonomous-department-of-commerce-ip-address-transition-internet-corporation-for-assigned-names-and-numbers/91281960/", "title": "U.S. set to hand over Internet address book", "text": "Elizabeth Weise\n\nUSATODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — The United States doesn’t own the Internet, but it’s held the oversight contract for the organization that runs its address book for many years. That’s set to change Friday.\n\nThe U.S. contract with the non-profit organization in charge of all Internet domain names expires then, and the non-profit running the database will become autonomous and be accountable to international stakeholders in the Internet community. These include a governmental advisory committee, a technical committee, industry committee, internet users and telecommunications experts.\n\nThe move has been opposed by some officials and lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz who say America is “giving away the Internet.”\n\nOn Thursday the attorneys general of Arizona, Oklahoma, Texas and Nevada filed a lawsuit asking a Federal district court to block the transition, alleging that it amounts to giving up U.S. government property, among other complaints.\n\nAt issue is oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. Created in 1998, the non-profit is based in Los Angeles. One of its main jobs, done by ICANN's Internet Assigned Numbers Authority department, is to coordinate the Domain Name System that matches address such as usatoday.com with their actual computer addresses, in this case 66.61.174.185.\n\nTo do that and other work, ICANN has a budget of more than $126 million a year.\n\nStarted with a clipboard\n\nIt began as a simple list of what names were assigned to what numbers, known as Internet Protocol addresses and was originally kept on a clipboard by Jon Postel, a famed computer scientist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe 18-year-old contract for ICANN has been held by the U.S. Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration but is not scheduled to be renewed on Sept. 30 when it comes to an end.\n\nAt that point ICANN will become an autonomous non-profit.\n\nVery little will change with the handover. The staff and protocols will remain the same. The only thing that changes is that the Department of Commerce will no longer be approving every change to the domain name root file, the master list of Internet addresses that allows the Internet to function.\n\nICANN was always meant to become independent. However, under President George W. Bush, the Department of Commerce backed away from that, saying in 2005 that it would “maintain its historic role in authorizing changes or modifications to the authoritative root zone file.”\n\nSnowden legacy\n\nEfforts to make it truly neutral and global came back into the fore in 2013, after National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about the depth of U.S. Internet surveillance. That pushed ICANN to begin working on a new transition proposal.\n\nReport: Snowden says NSA can tap e-mail, Facebook chats\n\nSome in the United States argue that the Internet has always belonged to the United States and that the handover is illegal and dangerous.\n\nCruz, a Republican from Texas and a former candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, has been very vocal in his belief that the move will harm the freedom of the Internet.\n\n“The likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Chinese President Xi Jinping should not dictate what can be read, written, distributed, bought and sold on the Internet,” he wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post when the plan was first discussed.\n\nA last-ditch effort by Cruz to stop it from taking effect failed this week when it was not included in a stop-gap spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nU.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), ranking member of the Senate subcommittee on communications, technology, innovation, called the suits by the four attorneys general lawsuit baseless.\n\n“Congress has repeatedly rejected attempts to delay the transition. Technology and foreign policy experts from across the political spectrum agree that any delay of this transition would only empower our enemies and undermine America’s commitment to keeping the internet open and free,\" he said in a statement.\n\nWho won the debate? Social media and 'The Cyber'\n\nWho owns the Internet?\n\nA U.S. Government Accountability Office report issued Sept. 12 found that the Internet \"address book\" was not U.S. government property.\n\nNew Net domains expand Web addressing system\n\nOthers dispute that such censorship would even be possible. The new entity that is scheduled to take over control on Oct. 1 is run through consensus and includes multiple stakeholders from many countries, said Milton Mueller, a professor in the school of public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a longtime participant in ICANN’s volunteer advisory groups.\n\n“It’s not like Russia and China suddenly have more power than anyone else. All the governments in the room have to agree to give advice to ICANN, but it’s non-binding. ICANN can not take the advice, particularly if all the other stakeholder groups strongly object to it,” said Mueller.\n\n“Their argument has been that ‘We are the bulwark of freedom in the world and if we let go of this, the Internet will go to hell.’ How much of them really believe that and how many are just exploiting this to make the Obama administration look bad isn’t clear to me,” said Mueller.\n\nWhile the Department of Commerce had been very hands off in its oversight of the contract, at least it provided a sort of safety valve, said Mark Grabowski, a professor of Internet law at Adelphi University, in Garden City, N.Y.\n\n“You knew if anything really went wrong you’d have the U.S. government to step in,” he said.\n\nHe expects any chances to be very gradual. “We really won’t know for three to five years whether this was something to worry about or not, whether the proponents can truthfully say, ‘We told you so,’ or the people who were critical had a point,” Grabowski said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/03/25/food-bank-of-delaware-to-lose-900000-meals-amid-trump-funding-cuts/82652067007/", "title": "Amid Trump funding cuts, Food Bank of Delaware to lose 900,000 ...", "text": "The Food Bank of Delaware was informed Tuesday that President Donald Trump's administration was canceling all 19 truckloads of food poised to provide 900,000 meals to hungry Delawareans.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture recently cut two programs that gave schools and food banks money to buy food from local farms to the tune of $1 billion.\n\nThe food bank said it will leave no stone unturned in trying to find resources and partners to help fill the large void the federal government's cuts have created.\n\nThe Food Bank of Delaware was informed Tuesday afternoon that the federal government is canceling deliveries, amounting to a shortage of 900,000 meals.\n\nThe nonprofit, which provides food for food-insecure Delawareans across the state, was told that all 19 truckloads scheduled for delivery over the next few months have been canceled. This follows President Donald Trump's halt of shipments of food aid and funding earlier this month.\n\nThe scheduled deliveries from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Food Assistance Program represent over 25% of the food the Food Bank of Delaware was expected to receive for the rest of the year.\n\nFood Bank of Delaware President & CEO Cathy Kanefsky said she received a call Tuesday afternoon informing the nonprofit that all 19 truckloads, which the organization expected would carry a total of 750,000 pounds of food, would not be arriving.\n\n“We have to prepare for the worst-case scenario, unfortunately,” Kanefsky told Delaware Online/The News Journal. “We are not being pulled into the conversation about what is going to happen or why.”\n\nThe agricultural department recently cut two programs that gave schools and food banks money to buy food from local farms to the tune of $1 billion, which has thrown nonprofits into chaos as officials grapple with how they’ll continue to fund these vital services.\n\n“Millions of dollars worth of deliveries of vital food aid have been halted to food banks,” Delaware Congresswoman Sarah McBride said on the U.S. House of Representatives floor on Tuesday. “Food banks, who are already stretched thin, are now being asked to do even more with even less. The loss of federal support jeopardizes their ability to serve effectively, placing additional strain on state and local resources.\"\n\nMcBride said the cuts amount to a $2 million funding loss for Delaware.\n\nHunger in Delaware\n\nOne in eight people struggle with food insecurity in Delaware. The situation is even more dire for the First State’s children: One in six kids face hunger.\n\nThe Food Bank of Delaware was founded in 1981, forming partnerships with farmers, manufacturers, brokers, wholesalers, and retailers to redistribute food to the hungry.\n\nThe nonprofit also provides food through home delivery and mobile and food pantries in Newark and Milford. It provides workforce training, financial coaching, nutrition education and benefits outreach, as well.\n\nBut even before the announced cuts to food aid in the United States, food banks were already stretched thin.\n\n“The sad truth is we were already kind of pinched,” Kanefsky said. “People who are coming to the food bank now are different than they were four to five years ago because food prices are up for all of us.”\n\nMore people are struggling with food insecurity because of rising food prices, forcing some people to take on several jobs to cover expenses. Making food prices more precarious is the fact that Delaware’s farmers are also owed about $10 million from the federal government, McBride pointed out.\n\nThe Democrat argued last month the administration illegally froze funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which was poised to help farmers improve their infrastructure and lower energy bills.\n\nFood Bank responds\n\nFood banks are in uncharted territory right now, Kanefsky said.\n\nThe Food Bank of Delaware has had a longstanding partnership with the federal agriculture department, she said, but even that has not staved off the cuts.\n\nIn turn, the nonprofit is leaning on its advocates like McBride and other federal delegates to get answers and work toward a solution, but Kanefsky said the food bank will leave no stone unturned.\n\nWhether it’s a neighborhood food drive or someone looking to donate a large sum of money, the nonprofit leader said all potential support will be tapped.\n\nIf you want to help in the food bank’s efforts, visit the website to learn more about how you can assist.\n\n“Everything is on the table and that’s how we’re approaching it,” she said. “Previous administrations in both parties invested in programs to connect farmers with food banks – this is not a partisan issue. We are really trying to drive that home as well. We are here for everyone. We serve everyone with respect.”\n\nGot a tip?

The Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that the line-item veto, for presidents to cancel parts of legislation rather than entire laws, was unconstitutional.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, said the memo appeared in “flagrant violation” of the Impoundment Control Act.\n\nStates call memo 'reckless' and 'ham-handed'\n\nThe states fighting the memo besides New York are California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta said in the news conference that $3 trillion in nationwide assistance is at risk from the memo, which he said had “thrown state programs into chaos.”\n\nBonta said he thinks disaster aid, such as for wildfires that caused billions in damage in the Los Angeles area, is at risk under the OMB memo.\n\n“I do believe the FEMA funding is at risk,” Bonta said. “We need it, we need it now.”\n\nJames said at least 20 states were frozen out of their Medicaid health care programs for the poor by Tuesday morning. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said her state receives $20 billion a year from the federal government, but a request Monday for $40 million from the Medicaid program has gone unanswered, she said.\n\n“It has a national impact,” Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the impact will ripple across programs that pave roads, provide law enforcement and distribute food.\n\n“What a ham-handed way to run a government,” Neronha said. “Every American, every Rhode Islander is impacted by this.”\n\nLeavitt said after her news conference that the White House was aware of the Medicaid website outage but that it would be online again soon.\n\n“We have confirmed no payments have been affected – they are still being processed and sent,” Leavitt said in a post on X. “We expect the portal will be back online shortly.”\n\nNonprofits, health groups warn of 'catastrophic' harm\n\nThe advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers said grant recipients would be reluctant to spend money until they knew their programs were approved by OMB.\n\n“This reckless action by the administration would be catastrophic for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,” said Diane Yentel, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. “From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to halting housing and food assistance, shuttering domestic violence and homeless shelters, and closing suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives.\"\n\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the memo threats to stall health programs. “Halting these funds stymies progress and is a matter of life and death,” he said.\n\nRichard Trent, executive director of the Main Street Alliance, said federal funding provides the backbone for community programs such as workforce training and childcare programs.\n\nMichael Adams, CEO of SAGE, said the memo puts LGBTQ+ individuals at risk because they are more vulnerable to health issues, disabilities and social isolation.\n\nWhite House says memo matches funding with Trump priorities\n\nLeavitt said the goal of the memo was to block funding for programs the president opposes such as Diversity, Equality and Inclusion in hiring and the Green New Deal for climate policy. Officials found $37 million about to be sent to the World Health Organization, which Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from, and $50 million for condoms in Gaza, which Leavitt called “a preposterous waste of government money.”\n\n“President Trump is looking out for you in issuing his pause,” she said.\n\n(This article has been updated with additional information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/18/doge-institute-of-peace-takeover/82503126007/", "title": "DOGE standoff with Institute of Peace requires police intervention", "text": "A stand-off between President Donald Trump's administration and an independent nonprofit came to a head this week in a dramatic public scene involving police.\n\nSince Friday, members of Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency had sought and been repeatedly denied access to the U.S. Institute of Peace office in Washington. After arriving again unannounced on Monday, the staffers were able to enter with assistance from Metropolitan Police Department officers.\n\nThe initial months of Trump's second term have been marked by his and his billionaire ally's endeavor to slash bureaucracy, consequently turning much of the federal government on its head. The president and Musk have purged department workforces and aimed to shutter entire agencies.\n\nAs Musk was spearheading the aggressive cuts, Trump signed an executive order last month directing four agencies, including the Institute of Peace, to reduce their personnel \"to the minimum presence and function required by law\" within 14 days. The group tasked with brokering peace and reducing foreign conflict is independent of the executive branch but receives annual funding from Congress.\n\nWhat followed was the expulsion of nearly a dozen institute board members and a series of faceoffs between the nonprofit and DOGE.\n\nAnd this latest incident comes on the heels of Trump's overhaul of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he ousted several board members and named himself the new chairman. It also follows DOGE's gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nWhat is the Institute of Peace?\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress in 1984, under former President Ronald Reagan, and specializes in resolving violent conflicts, according to its website. The organization describes itself online as \"a lean and cost-effective national security tool.\"\n\nOfficials from the institute have pushed back on Trump and Musk's cutting efforts by pointing to its status as an \"independent organization,\" saying that makes them exempt from DOGE directives.\n\nSeveral DOGE members arrived with FBI agents in tow Friday, according to a press release by USIP, but left after the institute's outside counsel told them the institute has a private status as a non-executive branch agency.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the move was in response to USIP's noncompliance with Trump's February reduction order.\n\n\"Rogue bureaucrats will not be allowed to hold agencies hostage,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"The Trump administration will enforce the President’s executive authority and ensure his agencies remain accountable to the American people.\"\n\nBoard overhaul, building takeover\n\nMonday's events appeared to be an escalation.\n\n“DOGE has broken into our building,\" said George Moose, who was removed from his position as president of the institute but is challenging the dismissal, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe president on Friday removed 11 of 14 board members, leaving Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Defense University President Peter Garvin. The three remaining board members voted to oust Moose and replace him with State Department official Kenneth Jackson.\n\nJackson was there with DOGE staffers Monday when Musk's team gained entry into the institute's headquarters with the help of police.\n\nMoose, speaking to press outside the office building, accused them of unlawful entry, New York Times reported.\n\n\"What has happened here today,\" he told reporters, \"is an illegal takeover by elements of the executive branch of a private nonprofit corporation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/18"}]}

Authorities braced for the possibility of major damage − tsunamis can cause a long series of waves, flood coastal areas and present other dangers for hours.\n\nLess than four hours later, however, the risk to Hawaii was downgraded from a tsunami warning to an advisory, which was dropped in the morning. There were no reports of serious damage. Coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington also canceled their advisories.\n\n\"I spoke to Governor of Hawaii @GovHawaii and the evacuation order has been lifted for coastal inundation zones,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media July 30. \"Please be careful when returning and watch out for damage. We will continue to monitor in Hawaii, Alaska, and California.\"\n\nState emergency management officials in Hawaii said widespread flooding was not expected. But they urged residents to \"remain cautious in or near the water. ... Stay away from beaches, shorelines, and out of the ocean.\"\n\nWhere are tsunami warnings and watches issued in the US?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Chile and Colombia issued evacuation orders for their Pacific coastline, and Chile also extended the precautions to its Eastern Island, about 2,300 miles off the mainland. Likewise, Ecuador ordered evacuations for parts of its Galapagos Islands.\n\n∎ Automated alerts for the Axial Seamount, the underwater volcano off the Oregon coast, were triggered by the giant earthquake and subsequent tsunami. It was a false alarm. The volcano did not erupt, and it hasn't since April 2015.\n\n∎ The Marquesas Islands, part of French Polynesia in the South Pacific, were hit by smaller waves than previously feared. Officials canceled a tsunami alert.\n\nTsunami advisory canceled in California\n\nIn California, Los Angeles beaches reopened and a tsunami advisory was canceled for San Diego and Orange counties. Later in the day, an advisory for most of the state's coastline was lifted as well. However, the portion from the Oregon border south to the county line between Humboldt and Del Norte remained under an advisory.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Los Angeles said strong currents will continue along the state's coast, including those parts not under a tsunami advisory, at least through Wednesday. Although widespread inundation isn’t expected, localized damage at harbors is possible because of the water surging in and out.\n\nPort San Luis in the central coast, including Avila Beach, will be of “particular concern.”\n\nTsunami waves began arriving overnight at Crescent City and Humboldt Bay on California's northern coast. Crescent City is located along a stretch of the West Coast considered most vulnerable to tsunamis based on previous events, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The waves get amplified in the area and are higher in the city’s harbor than at other locations along the coast.\n\n\"A Tsunami Advisory is in effect for coastal Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties,\" the weather service in Eureka posted on X July 30. \"Tsunami waves of 1-3 ft are still ... observed early this morning. Avoid beaches and harbors.\"\n\nDrastic water level shifts in Hawaii, California\n\nWater levels continue to surge back and forth within minutes at tide gauges in Hawaii and along the U.S. West Coast.\n\nOne of the biggest surges was seen at Kahului Harbor on the northern coast of Maui, as the tsunami began to arrive. The NOAA tide gauge station shows the water receded to a level of minus 2.35 feet, then surged to 6.75 in just 18 minutes, a difference of more than 9 feet.\n\nSome nine hours later, the tide was still rising and falling as much as 3 feet within about 12 minutes, according to the preliminary measurements from the tide gauge.\n\nAt Port San Luis in central California, the tide level changed more than 2 1/2 feet in just 12 minutes, according to preliminary measurements from NOAA.\n\nTsunami waves or surf waves? What to know\n\nThe notion of a tsunami may inspire thoughts of long rides for some intrepid surfers, but its waves are nowhere close to surfable and quite different from the ones at Malibu beach or Oahu's North Shore.\n\nDuring tsunamis, the entire water column from the surface to the bottom of the ocean gets moved, generating an enormous amount of energy and rushing into land like a flood, often carrying debris.\n\nTsunami waves are much faster − around 500 mph at the deepest points. That's the speed of a commercial plane at cruising altitude, though they slow down considerably near the shore. They also don't break into a curl like surfing waves.\n\nThe time in between waves in a tsunami is measured in minutes and even hours, not seconds as with wind waves. Oh, and watch out when a tsunami wave recedes, leaving the seafloor exposed for a long stretch.\n\nNoem says FEMA was fully deployed if needed\n\nNoem, in Chile for meetings, said the tsunami was expected to have \"minimal impact\" in the U.S.\n\n“We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary, but grateful that that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,\" Noem said.\n\nShe said FEMA was at an \"enhanced level\" an that the Coast Guard was deployed. Noem, asked if FEMA is equipped to handle no-notice disasters, responded with a familiar refrain.\n\n“We should always remember that FEMA was established to be an agency that supports local authorities,\" she said. \"Our job with FEMA is to come in and support their efforts, and we will continue to do that. But these governors have done a fantastic job being prepared for the situation they faced yesterday, and then going into today.”\n\nTsunami waves reach Washington state\n\nTsunami waves began arriving along the coast of Washington state, where a tsunami advisory was in effect, shortly after midnight local time. The weather service said, \"strong and unusual\" currents were likely, but coastal inundation was not expected.\n\n\"We continue to see tsunami waves arrive along the coast as well as Strait of Juan de Fuca,\" the weather service office in Seattle posted seven hours later. \"Reminder: Do not attempt to go to the shore to observe the tsunami waves. Keep away until local officials say it is safe to return.\"\n\nA tsunami watch was downgraded to an advisory in Oregon. The weather service in Portland warned that \"while tempting, do not go to the coast to watch waves coming in. Currents can be unpredictable and it will be dark out.\"\n\nAlaska could feel impact for days, forecasters warn\n\nInitial tsunami warnings have been cancelled or downgraded in much of Alaska, but an advisory still exists along the state's Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula along an over 1,000-mile stretch from Attu Island to Chignik Bay, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage as of 2:45 a.m. local time.\n\nCurrents at beaches and harbors, marinas, bays and inlets can be especially dangerous in the wake of tsunami waves and the danger can last for days, forecasters said.\n\nTsunami waves have been recorded at gauges along the Aleutian Islands, with the highest wave of 2.7 feet near Adak Island at about 10:21 p.m. local time on July 29.\n\n“Impacts from Tsunamis may continue for many hours to days after arrival of the first wave,” forecasters said.\n\nDetails on the historic Russian earthquake\n\nThe magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula is now among the ten largest ever recorded on the planet. With a depth of about 12 miles, the shallow quake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET approximately 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the geologically active region known for intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nIn a video posted to the Telegram messaging app, Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said preliminary information indicates there were no injuries but added that a kindergarten building was damaged.\n\nSolodov described the quake as \"serious and the strongest in decades.\"\n\nQuake triggers volcano in Russia\n\nThe Klyuchevskoy volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's far east started erupting after a powerful earthquake in the Pacific, Russian state news agency RIA reported. According to preliminary information, hot lava is flowing down the western slope, explosions were heard and a bright glow was visible above the volcano, RIA said.\n\nLast week, rescuers recommended tourists not visit the volcano due to the increased activity. Klyuchevskoy volcano, 16,000 feet above sea level, last erupted in April 2025.\n\n− Dan Morrison\n\nAfter earthquake and tsunami, volcano erupts in Russia's far east\n\nWhat is the Pacific Tsunami Center?\n\nThe United States is served by two tsunami centers operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center serves the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific and Caribbean territories and the British Virgin Islands. It also covers the international forecast for nations in the Pacific and Caribbean Basins. It’s located on Hawaii’s Ford Island, on the south side of Oahu near Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe other, the National Tsunami Warning Center, serves the mainland United States, Alaska and Canada. The warning centers are staffed 24/7 to monitor for tsunamis or earthquakes that could cause them, issue tsunami messages and work to improve warnings.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center was first established in the wake of official tsunami warnings that began in 1949, in response to a 1946 tsunami that devastated Hilo, Hawaii, known as the April Fools Day Tsunami.\n\nTrump warns of tsunami on social media\n\nShortly before 11:30 p.m. ET, a tsunami advisory was upgraded to a warning for the coastal areas of California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon-California border, the weather service said. A tsunami warning means significant inundation is possible.\n\nEarlier in the night, President Donald Trump took to social media to warn of the tsunami.\n\n\"Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,\" he posted on X. \"... STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"\n\nMost areas along the U.S. Pacific Coast can expect a tsunami of less than 1 foot, the National Weather Service said just after 10:30 p.m. E.T. But even a tsunami of that size can generate deadly currents, the weather service warned.\n\nWhat is a tsunami warning? What to know after huge earthquake.\n\nTsunami waves recorded in Hawaii\n\nAfter authorities urged residents and tourists to move to higher ground and evacuate from coastal zones, initial data showed waves arriving on the evening of July 29 were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet.\n\nTsunami waves in Hawaii reached amplitudes of up to 5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui, a measurement that compares the wave to height above normal sea level, the weather service said. In Hilo, the wave amplitude reached 4.9 feet.\n\n\"Look, everything has been OK so far. We haven't seen a big wave,\" Green said at around 8:30 p.m. But he said officials were concerned about an earlier pullback of water, which can signal a tsunami risk.\n\nHawaii has a long history with tsunamis\n\nThe state of Hawaii is one of the more tsunami susceptible spots in the world, thanks to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by the infamous seismic activity known as the \"ring of fire.\"\n\nTsunami waves can arrive in the islands from any location around the ocean, including Russia, South America and Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On average, Hawaii experiences destructive tsunamis about once every 11 years.\n\nThe earliest historical accounts emerge from oral histories of the islands, including a 16th century chant about a wave that struck the coast of Molokai'i.\n\nWhen was the tsunami predicted to hit Hawaii?\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for Hawaii, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. The agency estimated that the first tsunami wave will arrive at around 7:17 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.\n\n\"A tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii,\" the agency said in a bulletin. \"Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property.\"\n\nThe Honolulu Department of Emergency Management called for the evacuation of some coastal areas in Hawaii. \"Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,\" the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.\n\nIn a video update at 5:50 p.m. local time, Green said authorities were prepared and noted that county officials were “fully involved” in emergency management. The governor warned residents and visitors to not be outside on all shorelines when the wave strikes, adding that warning sirens will be used within the next hour.\n\n“(The earthquake has) caused a wave we believe that will be significant,” Green said. “People need to evacuate — that’s very clear. They have to be out of the evacuation zone or up four stories.”\n\n'It’s always scary to get an alert like that': Hawaii residents rush to higher ground\n\nShortly after the initial tsunami warning sirens went off at around 3 p.m. local time in Hawaii, the streets of Honolulu, including the tourist hub Waikiki, were congested as people quickly tried to move to higher ground and away from coastal evacuation zones. Some reported long lines at gas stations, as sirens continued to go off on the hour to the estimated first wave.\n\nOahu local Megan Lee said she hit more traffic than usual on her commute home from work. “It’s nice to see everyone taking it seriously,” Lee told USA TODAY. “It’s always scary to get an alert like that.”\n\nSome felt desensitized to the warning following the 2018 false missile alert, when residents woke up to an emergency alert notification that a ballistic missle was headed their way. Residents across the islands scrambled to find shelter before learning it was sent as an error.\n\nLee, who was living on Oahu during the false missile alert, said she feels desensitized to these types of warnings. “It makes me not take the sirens as seriously, unfortunately,” she said. “We get a lot of alarms in Hawaii, and you see people going surfing because there’s a tsunami warning.”\n\nThose living more inland said they’re not as concerned about the warning, like Honolulu resident Julie Shimer. “I think it’s great (the state) is being more cautious,” Shimer told USA TODAY. “It’s always better being more prepared just in case.”\n\nIn a statement sent on the afternoon of July 29, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said, “Residents and visitors are urged to monitor local media for updates and stay away from the coastline. For those flying in or out of Hawaii today please check with your airline for the status of your flight.”\n\n— Kathleen Wong\n\nSan Diego officials monitoring tsunami situation\n\nIn San Diego County, officials were monitoring the situation on the evening of July 29. San Diego County spokesperson Chuck Westerheide said the county would issue an alert if necessary, but stressed that so far, a tsunami advisory was all that was in place.\n\n“As of 8:08 p.m. (local time) we are in an advisory area, meaning strong currents and a tsunami are possible and waves and currents can kill or injure people who are in the water,” Westerheide said. “But that’s key — people who are in the water.”\n\n“Currents at beaches in harbors, marinas, bays and inlets may be especially dangerous,” he added.\n\nIlya Zaides, who lives on the beach in La Jolla, said he was monitoring X while also waiting to see if an official alert would be issued.\n\n“We’re going to wait and see if there’s an alert, and hopefully there will be enough time to leave if we need to,” Zaides said.\n\n— Will Carless\n\nTsunami activity possible in Alaska\n\nThe tsunami warning for Alaska includes coastal areas from Attu to Samalga Pass. The tsunami advisory has been expanded to areas from Samalga Pass to Chignik Bay. Expected tsunami start times in Alaska include the following: 6:45 p.m., Unalaska; 7:25 p.m., Sand Point and 8:00 p.m. Cold Bay.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center advises that tsunami activity is possible at Shemya, Alaska beginning at 4:46 p.m., Alaskan Daylight Time, then at 5:46 p.m. at Adak and 7:06 p.m. at Saint Paul, about 760 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nA buoy south-southwest of Attu, Alaska detected a tsunami wave of 3 feet, the weather service reported. The measurements from DART buoys are from the deep ocean and are generally much smaller than the wave would be when it arrives at the coast, the weather service said.\n\nTsunami alerts issued in the U.S. Here's where.\n\nHazardous currents warned for coastal communities in California\n\nIn San Francisco and Monterey, California, the weather service expects to see tsunami heights of less than one feet, but advises it could present strong and hazardous currents.\n\n\"Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,\" the weather service said. \"Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami.\"\n\nIn San Diego, the weather service said the area should not expect widespread inundation, but advised people in coastal areas under the advisory to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas.\n\n\"Dangerous and powerful currents are still expected within the ocean and along the coast,\" said Dial Hoang, a weather service meteorologist in San Francisco. \"In 2011, a man near Crescent City died after he was swept out to sea while trying to photograph the tsunami coming in.\"\n\nThe highest peak wave is forecast for Crescent City, California, where the height could peak at between 2.9 feet and 5.4 feet, with tsunami waves lasting for 36 hours. In Port San Luis, California, the waves could peak at 2 to 3.8 feet and last for 24 hours, the weather service warned.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times for West Coast\n\nPossible tsunami start times stretch from 8:20 p.m. local time in Kodiak, Alaska, southward along the coast to La Jolla, California, where tsunami activity would be expected to begin by 1:15 a.m. local time.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times, in local times, for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska : Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m.\n\n: Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m. British Columbia : Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m.\n\n: Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m. Washington state : La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30\n\n: La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30 Oregon : Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m.\n\n: Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m. California: Fort Bragg - 11:50 p.m., Monterey - 12:15 a.m. on July 30, San Francisco - 12:40 a.m. on July 30, Los Angeles Harbor - 1:05 a.m. on July 30, and La Jolla - 1:15 a.m. on July 30\n\nAlong the West Coast, the weather service warned after 10 p.m. ET that widespread inundation is not expected in most locations. The weather service office in Seattle, Washington has advised that the tsunami waves are expected to arrive on the coast at Moclips at 11:50 p.m. and last for nine hours. The forecast peak of the highest wave is .8 to 1.4 feet, the weather service said.\n\n\"This is a significant, real event,\" said Reid Wolcott, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle. \"The imminent threat is for Alaska and areas near the quake. The National Tsunami Warning Center needs additional observation information before more is known about the threat to the US West Coast.\"\n\nIt will take time for ocean buoys and other observations to come in so that the tsunami warning centers can make a forecast with real data, Wolcott said.\n\nWave heights expected along U.S. Pacific Coast\n\nThough the peak of the tsunami could be less than a foot, the weather service has warned that it could still be dangerous. Estimated wave heights for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska : Adak - 1.2 to 2.2 feet; and Unalaska, Saint Paul, Sand Point, and Cold Bay are all less than 1 foot.\n\n: Adak - 1.2 to 2.2 feet; and Unalaska, Saint Paul, Sand Point, and Cold Bay are all less than 1 foot. British Columbia : Langara and Tofino are less than 1 foot\n\n: Langara and Tofino are less than 1 foot Oregon : Port Orford - 1 to 1.8 feet, Charleston - less than 1 foot, and Brookings - 0.8 to 1.5 feet\n\n: Port Orford - 1 to 1.8 feet, Charleston - less than 1 foot, and Brookings - 0.8 to 1.5 feet Washington state : Moclips - 0.7 to 1.3 feet; and Neah Bay, Long Beach, Westport, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, and Bellingham are all less than 1 foot.\n\n: Moclips - 0.7 to 1.3 feet; and Neah Bay, Long Beach, Westport, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, and Bellingham are all less than 1 foot. California: Fort Bragg - 0.8 to 1.4 feet; Crescent City - 2.9 to 5.4 feet; Santa Barbara, 0.7- 1.3 feet; and Monterey, San Francisco, Los Angeles Harbor, Newport Beach, and La Jolla are all less than 1 foot.\n\n'Risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed'\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the \"developing tsunami threat that may impact coastal areas of Hawaii, Alaska, and the western United States.\"\n\n“Any earthquake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 poses a tsunami risk, even thousands of miles away from the epicenter,” said AccuWeather Vice President of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin. “The force of water from tsunamis is incredibly violent and destructive.”\n\nPreliminary data currently indicates that strong currents, wave surges, and possible inundation in low-lying areas are possible in areas where tsunami warnings have been issued, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"This earthquake is likely to be in the top 10 strongest ever recorded. The strongest was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which was 9.4-9.6 magnitude. The March 2011 earthquake that triggered the tsunami which devastated parts of Japan was a 9.0-9.1 magnitude,” DePodwin added. “Although not all major earthquakes lead to tsunamis, the risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed.\"\n\nDePodwin noted that a tsunami would not reach Hawaii for at least several hours and advised the public to follow guidelines from local emergency officials.\n\nTsunami alerts issued for Japan, Pacific Islands\n\nThe Japan Weather Agency upgraded its warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 10 feet to reach large coastal areas starting around 10:00 a.m. local time. Much of Japan's eastern seaboard, which was devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011, was ordered to evacuate.\n\nTsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan's Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.\n\nThe U.S. Tsunami Warning System also issued a warning of \"hazardous tsunami waves\" within the next three hours along some coasts of Russia, Japan and Hawaii. A tsunami watch was also in effect for the U.S. island territory of Guam and other islands of Micronesia.\n\nIn Guam, the weather service is warning of sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents that could be a hazard along beaches and in harbors. The weather service has advised people to get out of the ocean and move away from beaches and harbors, following the instructions of local government officials. The estimated time of the activity in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan is 2:37 p.m. local time.\n\nA tsunami advisory is in effect for American Samoa, where hazardous sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents could occur beginning at 9:39 p.m. local time. Tsunami alerts also are in effect along the coast of Central and South America.\n\nVolcanoes are turning in their sleep: What does that mean for Washington?\n\nEarthquake in Russia was 'the strongest in decades of tremors'\n\nThe powerful earthquake generated a tsunami of up to 13 feet in Russia, prompting evacuations and damaging buildings, officials said.\n\n\"Today's earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\" Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters.\n\nMultiple aftershocks were also recorded following the major quake, ranging between a magnitude of 5.2 and 6.9, according to the USGS. Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nRussia's Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The area was evacuated.\n\nWhile a kindergarten was also damaged, no serious injuries or fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.\n\nWhat do tsunami alerts mean?\n\nThe National Weather Service said tsunami messages are issued by the tsunami warning centers to alert local authorities and the public of a possible tsunami. There are four levels of tsunami alerts, according to the weather service:\n\nTsunami Warning : \"Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.\"\n\n: \"Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.\" Tsunami Advisory : \"Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring. There may be flooding of beach and harbor areas.\"\n\n: \"Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring.

A tsunami is possible.\" Tsunami Information Statement: \"Relax—An earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away and the threat has not been determined. In most cases, there is no threat of a destructive tsunami.\"\n\nHow does NOAA track tsunamis?\n\nA real-time tsunami monitoring system created by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Washington placed buoys at strategic locations throughout the ocean and they play a critical role in tsunami forecasting, according to the NOAA. The buoys are named DART, for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis.\n\nWhen a tsunami event occurs, the first information available is the seismic information from the preceding earthquake, according to NOAA. As the tsunami wave moves across the ocean, it reaches the DART systems, which report sea level information measurements to the Tsunami Warning Centers. That buoy data is used to refine estimates of the tsunami source and to make the forecasts for watches, warnings and evacuations.\n\nThe Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory is working on a third generation of the buoy system, but the laboratory is one of those proposed to be closed under the budget NOAA has proposed for the coming year.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/07/30/russia-earthquake-megathrust-fault-tsunami-warning/85440345007/", "title": "Russian 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit on 'megathrust fault'", "text": "David Stanway\n\nReuters\n\nAI-assisted summary An 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings across the Pacific.\n\nThe quake, the largest since the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, occurred on a \"megathrust fault\" where the Pacific Plate slides under the North American Plate.\n\nTsunami waves reached Hawaii, but were smaller than initially predicted.\n\nSINGAPORE - The 8.8 magnitude quake off Russia that triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific occurred on what is known as a \"megathrust fault\", where the denser Pacific Plate is sliding underneath the lighter North American Plate, scientists said.\n\nThe Pacific Plate has been on the move, making the Kamchatka Peninsula area off Russia's Far East coast, where it struck, especially vulnerable to such tremors - and bigger aftershocks cannot be ruled out, they said.\n\nWith its epicentre near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, it was the largest earthquake since the devastating Tohoku event in 2011, which caused a tsunami that led to the meltdown of Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.\n\n\"The Kamchatka seismic zone is one of the most active subduction zones around the Pacific Ring of Fire, and the Pacific Plate is moving westwards at around 80 mm (3 inches) per year,\" said Roger Musson, honorary research fellow at the British Geological Survey.\n\n\"Subduction\" events, in which one plate pushes under another, are capable of generating far stronger earthquakes than \"strike slips\", such as the one that hit Myanmar in March, where plates brush horizontally against one another at different speeds.\n\nThe Kamchatka area is particularly vulnerable and experienced a magnitude 9 event in November 1952, wiping out the town of Severo-Kurilsk and causing extensive damage as far away as Hawaii, Musson told Reuters.\n\nShallow \"megathrust\" events are more likely to cause tsunamis because they burst through the sea floor and displace huge volumes of water.\n\nTsunami Risks\n\nWith a relatively shallow depth of 20.7 km (13 miles), the earthquake on Wednesday, July 30 was always going to create such tsunami risks, experts said.\n\n\"It is an offshore earthquake, and when you have offshore earthquakes, there is the potential for tsunamis,\" said Adam Pascal, chief scientist at Australia's Seismology Research Centre.\n\n\"If you have a relatively shallow earthquake, it is more likely to rupture the surface of the ocean floor,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"We've seen in some cases you can have large earthquakes like this and not cause a tsunami because they are too deep and the shearing doesn't express itself at the surface.\"\n\nTsunami waves of around 1.7 metres (5.5 feet) reached as far as Hawaii, less high than originally expected, but scientists warned that such waves do not have to be especially big to do damage to the relatively low-lying coastlines of Pacific island nations.\n\nParts of French Polynesia were told to brace for waves as high as 4 metres (13 ft).\n\nThe impact of a tsunami depends on its \"run-up\" as it approaches coastlines, Pascal said.\n\n\"If you have a very long, shallow run-up to the coast, a lot of the energy can be dissipated over that run-up, but if it is a very steep shelf before you get to the coast, the wave height can be higher,\" he said.\n\nForeshocks and Aftershocks\n\nJuly 30's quake has already triggered at least 10 aftershocks above magnitude 5, and they could continue for months, said Caroline Orchiston, director of the Centre for Sustainability at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\n\"This demonstrates that large-magnitude earthquakes generate aftershock sequences that start immediately, and some of these can be damaging in their own right,\" she said.\n\nThe 8.8 magnitude event came less than two weeks after a magnitude 7.4 earthquake in the same area, which has now been identified as a \"foreshock.\"\n\n\"Earthquakes by their nature are unpredictable,\" said Pascal. \"There are no precursors that are scientifically consistent in earthquake sequences. Before this morning, those other ones were the main shocks.\"\n\nBigger aftershocks cannot entirely be ruled out, he added, but their magnitude and frequency normally tend to decrease over time.\n\n\"You can expect large aftershocks to continue for some time, but the frequency of large, damaging events will reduce as time goes on,\" he said.\n\n\"There is always a chance of a larger event, but that larger event will usually occur relatively soon after, within days or weeks.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/07/30/tsunami-waves-reach-hawaii-west-coast-after-earthquake-off-russia/85436125007/", "title": "Tsunami waves reach Hawaii, West Coast after earthquake off Russia", "text": "AI-assisted summary A magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves that reached Hawaii and the West Coast.\n\nWhile initial warnings prompted evacuations, most were downgraded to advisories as wave heights were less than initially feared.\n\nCrescent City, California, experienced the highest wave heights on the West Coast, while Hawaii saw waves up to 5.7 feet.\n\nTsunami waves reached Hawaii and the West Coast after one of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history, a magnitude 8.8 temblor, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29 before most of the warnings were downgraded hours later.\n\nThe waves began arriving in Hawaii after 7 p.m. local time, but initial observations were heartening to officials bracing for major damage in the state. By 10:45, authorities announced that the Tsunami Warning System had downgraded risk to the state from a tsunami warning to an advisory. There were no major reports of damage.\n\n\"Evacuations canceled for Oahu. Residents may return home,\" state emergency management officials posted on social media July 30. \"Remain cautious in or near the water. Widespread flooding is NOT expected. Stay away from beaches, shorelines, and out of the ocean.\"\n\nTsunami waves began to arrive at Crescent City, California, and Humboldt Bay overnight, the weather service in Eureka posted on X. Tsunamis can cause a long series of waves, extensively flood coastal areas and present dangers that continue for many hours.\n\n\"Tsunami activity is continuing to build this morning as we approach the 4 AM minor high tide,\" the weather service posted July 30 on X. The post said maximum confirmed heights for the coast included 3.6 feet at Crescent City and urged residents to avoid beaches and harbors \"as tsunami activity will persist.\"\n\nCrescent City is located along a stretch of the West Coast under a tsunami warning, an upgraded risk level from the rest of the West Coast. The area is considered more vulnerable to tsunamis than any other part of the West Coast based on previous events, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The waves get amplified in the area and are higher in the city’s harbor than at other locations along the coast.\n\nMeanwhile, along the Washington Coast, tsunami waves began arriving just after midnight local time, according to the Seattle weather service office, but wave height measurements weren't yet available.\n\nInitial tsunami warnings have been cancelled or downgraded in much of Alaska, but an advisory still exists along the state's Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula along an over 1,000-mile stretch from Attu Island to Chignik Bay, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage as of 2:45 a.m. local time.\n\nCurrents at beaches and harbors, marinas, bays and inlets can be especially dangerous in the wake of tsunami waves and the danger can last for days, forecasters said.\n\nTsunami waves have been recorded at gauges along the Aleutian Islands, with the highest wave of 2.7 feet near Adak Island at about 10:21 p.m. local time on July 29.\n\n“Impacts from Tsunamis may continue for many hours to days after arrival of the first wave,” forecasters said.\n\nThe earthquake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET, about 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. The agency stated that the quake was shallow, occurring at a depth of approximately 12 miles.\n\nA wall collapsed in a kindergarten in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, but there were no casualties, the Russian news agency Tass reported. Elsewhere, several people sought medical assistance, Tass said. And a tsunami wave made landfall on the coast near Severo-Kurilsk, the government of the Sakhalin Region told Tass.\n\nThe United States is served by two tsunami centers operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center serves the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific and Caribbean territories and the British Virgin Islands. It also covers the international forecast for nations in the Pacific and Caribbean Basins. It’s located on Hawaii’s Ford Island, on the south side of Oahu near Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe other, the National Tsunami Warning Center, serves the mainland United States, Alaska and Canada. The warning centers are staffed 24/7 to monitor for tsunamis or earthquakes that could cause them, issue tsunami messages and work to improve warnings.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center was first established in the wake of official tsunami warnings that began in 1949, in response to a 1946 tsunami that devastated Hilo, Hawaii, known as the April Fools Day Tsunami.\n\nShortly before 11:30 p.m. ET, a tsunami advisory was upgraded to a warning for the coastal areas of California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon-California border, the weather service said. A tsunami warning means significant inundation is possible.\n\nEarlier in the night, President Donald Trump took to social media to warn of the tsunami.\n\n\"Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,\" he posted on X. \"... STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"\n\nMost areas along the U.S. Pacific Coast can expect a tsunami of less than 1 foot, the National Weather Service said just after 10:30 p.m. E.T. But even a tsunami of that size can generate deadly currents, the weather service warned.\n\nWhat is a tsunami warning? What to know after huge earthquake.\n\nAfter authorities urged residents and tourists to move to higher ground and evacuate from coastal zones, initial data showed waves arriving on the evening of July 29 were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet.\n\nTsunami waves in Hawaii reached amplitudes of up to 5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui, a measurement that compares the wave to height above normal sea level, the weather service said. In Hilo, the wave amplitude reached 4.9 feet.\n\n\"Look, everything has been OK so far. We haven't seen a big wave,\" Green said at around 8:30 p.m. But he said officials were concerned about an earlier pullback of water, which can signal a tsunami risk.\n\nContext: Hawaii has a long history with tsunamis, thanks to the 'ring of fire'\n\nThe state of Hawaii is one of the more tsunami susceptible spots in the world, thanks to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by the infamous seismic activity known as the \"ring of fire.\"\n\nTsunami waves can arrive in the islands from any location around the ocean, including Russia, South America and Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On average, Hawaii experiences destructive tsunamis about once every 11 years.\n\nThe earliest historical accounts emerge from oral histories of the islands, including a 16th century chant about a wave that struck the coast of Molokai'i.\n\nRead more: Hawaii has a long history with tsunamis, thanks to the 'ring of fire'\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for Hawaii, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. The agency estimated that the first tsunami wave will arrive at around 7:17 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.\n\n\"A tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii,\" the agency said in a bulletin. \"Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property.\"\n\nThe Honolulu Department of Emergency Management called for the evacuation of some coastal areas in Hawaii. \"Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,\" the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.\n\nIn a video update at 5:50 p.m. local time, Green said authorities were prepared and noted that county officials were “fully involved” in emergency management. The governor warned residents and visitors to not be outside on all shorelines when the wave strikes, adding that warning sirens will be used within the next hour.\n\n“(The earthquake has) caused a wave we believe that will be significant,” Green said. “People need to evacuate — that’s very clear. They have to be out of the evacuation zone or up four stories.”\n\nShortly after the initial tsunami warning sirens went off at around 3 p.m. local time in Hawaii, the streets of Honolulu, including the tourist hub Waikiki, were congested as people quickly tried to move to higher ground and away from coastal evacuation zones. Some reported long lines at gas stations, as sirens continued to go off on the hour to the estimated first wave.\n\nOahu local Megan Lee said she hit more traffic than usual on her commute home from work. “It’s nice to see everyone taking it seriously,” Lee told USA TODAY. “It’s always scary to get an alert like that.”\n\nSome felt desensitized to the warning following the 2018 false missile alert, when residents woke up to an emergency alert notification that a ballistic missle was headed their way. Residents across the islands scrambled to find shelter before learning it was sent as an error.\n\nLee, who was living on Oahu during the false missile alert, said she feels desensitized to these types of warnings. “It makes me not take the sirens as seriously, unfortunately,” she said. “We get a lot of alarms in Hawaii, and you see people going surfing because there’s a tsunami warning.”\n\nThose living more inland said they’re not as concerned about the warning, like Honolulu resident Julie Shimer. “I think it’s great (the state) is being more cautious,” Shimer told USA TODAY. “It’s always better being more prepared just in case.”\n\nIn a statement sent on the afternoon of July 29, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said, “Residents and visitors are urged to monitor local media for updates and stay away from the coastline. For those flying in or out of Hawaii today please check with your airline for the status of your flight.”\n\n— Kathleen Wong\n\nIn San Diego County, officials were monitoring the situation on the evening of July 29. San Diego County spokesperson Chuck Westerheide said the county would issue an alert if necessary, but stressed that so far, a tsunami advisory was all that was in place.\n\n“As of 8:08 p.m. (local time) we are in an advisory area, meaning strong currents and a tsunami are possible and waves and currents can kill or injure people who are in the water,” Westerheide said. “But that’s key — people who are in the water.”\n\n“Currents at beaches in harbors, marinas, bays and inlets may be especially dangerous,” he added.\n\nIlya Zaides, who lives on the beach in La Jolla, said he was monitoring X while also waiting to see if an official alert would be issued.\n\n“We’re going to wait and see if there’s an alert, and hopefully there will be enough time to leave if we need to,” Zaides said.\n\n— Will Carless\n\nThe tsunami warning for Alaska includes coastal areas from Attu to Samalga Pass. The tsunami advisory has been expanded to areas from Samalga Pass to Chignik Bay. Expected tsunami start times in Alaska include the following: 6:45 p.m., Unalaska; 7:25 p.m., Sand Point and 8:00 p.m. Cold Bay.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center advises that tsunami activity is possible at Shemya, Alaska beginning at 4:46 p.m., Alaskan Daylight Time, then at 5:46 p.m. at Adak and 7:06 p.m. at Saint Paul, about 760 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nA buoy south-southwest of Attu, Alaska detected a tsunami wave of 3 feet, the weather service reported. The measurements from DART buoys are from the deep ocean and are generally much smaller than the wave would be when it arrives at the coast, the weather service said.\n\nTsunami alerts issued in the U.S. Here's where.\n\nIn San Francisco and Monterey, California, the weather service expects to see tsunami heights of less than one feet, but advises it could present strong and hazardous currents.\n\n\"Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,\" the weather service said. \"Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami.\"\n\nIn San Diego, the weather service said the area should not expect widespread inundation, but advised people in coastal areas under the advisory to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas.\n\n\"Dangerous and powerful currents are still expected within the ocean and along the coast,\" said Dial Hoang, a weather service meteorologist in San Francisco. \"In 2011, a man near Crescent City died after he was swept out to sea while trying to photograph the tsunami coming in.\"\n\nThe highest peak wave is forecast for Crescent City, California, where the height could peak at between 2.9 feet and 5.4 feet, with tsunami waves lasting for 36 hours. In Port San Luis, California, the waves could peak at 2 to 3.8 feet and last for 24 hours, the weather service warned.\n\nPossible tsunami start times stretch from 8:20 p.m. local time in Kodiak, Alaska, southward along the coast to La Jolla, California, where tsunami activity would be expected to begin by 1:15 a.m. local time.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times, in local times, for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska : Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m.\n\n: Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m. British Columbia : Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m.\n\n: Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m. Washington state : La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30\n\n: La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30 Oregon : Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m.\n\n: Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m. California: Fort Bragg - 11:50 p.m., Monterey - 12:15 a.m. on July 30, San Francisco - 12:40 a.m. on July 30, Los Angeles Harbor - 1:05 a.m. on July 30, and La Jolla - 1:15 a.m. on July 30\n\nAlong the West Coast, the weather service warned after 10 p.m. ET that widespread inundation is not expected in most locations. The weather service office in Seattle, Washington has advised that the tsunami waves are expected to arrive on the coast at Moclips at 11:50 p.m. and last for nine hours. The forecast peak of the highest wave is .8 to 1.4 feet, the weather service said.\n\n\"This is a significant, real event,\" said Reid Wolcott, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle. \"The imminent threat is for Alaska and areas near the quake. The National Tsunami Warning Center needs additional observation information before more is known about the threat to the US West Coast.\"\n\nIt will take time for ocean buoys and other observations to come in so that the tsunami warning centers can make a forecast with real data, Wolcott said.\n\nThough the peak of the tsunami could be less than a foot, the weather service has warned that it could still be dangerous.

A tsunami watch was also in effect for the U.S. island territory of Guam and other islands of Micronesia.\n\nIn Guam, the weather service is warning of sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents that could be a hazard along beaches and in harbors. The weather service has advised people to get out of the ocean and move away from beaches and harbors, following the instructions of local government officials. The estimated time of the activity in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan is 2:37 p.m. local time.\n\nA tsunami advisory is in effect for American Samoa, where hazardous sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents could occur beginning at 9:39 p.m. local time. Tsunami alerts also are in effect along the coast of Central and South America.\n\nVolcanoes are turning in their sleep: What does that mean for Washington?\n\nThe powerful earthquake generated a tsunami of up to 13 feet in Russia, prompting evacuations and damaging buildings, officials said.\n\n\"Today's earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\" Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters.\n\nMultiple aftershocks were also recorded following the major quake, ranging between a magnitude of 5.2 and 6.9, according to the USGS. Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nRussia's Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami.

That buoy data is used to refine estimates of the tsunami source and to make the forecasts for watches, warnings and evacuations.\n\nThe Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory is working on a third generation of the buoy system, but the laboratory is one of those proposed to be closed under the budget NOAA has proposed for the coming year.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/30/strongest-earthquakes-ever-in-the-world/85434059007/", "title": "Russian quake is among the top 10 in history: See where it ranks", "text": "A magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29 is now among the 10 largest ever recorded on the planet.\n\nWith a depth of about 12 miles, the shallow quake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET approximately 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Vladimir Solodov said preliminary information indicates there were no injuries but added that a kindergarten building was damaged, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Today's earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\" Solodov said, per Reuters.\n\nA tsunami of up to 13 feet generated by the quake prompted evacuations and damaged buildings in the transcontinental country. Following the record-breaking quake, multiple aftershocks were recorded ranging between a magnitude of 5.2 to 6.9, the USGS reported.\n\nCoasts of Russia, Japan and Hawaii were all subject to warnings of \"hazardous tsunami waves\" issued by the U.S. Tsunami Warning System. Tsunami alerts were also issued for the entire U.S. West Coast with officials issuing evacuation warnings in Hawaii, the U.S. Geological Survey said.\n\nHere's how the major earthquake ranks among the largest ever recorded, dating as far back as 1906.\n\nHow does the 2025 Russia earthquake compare?\n\nThe magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29, 2025 is now among the top 10 magnitudes ever recorded, along with two other 8.8-magnitude earthquakes.\n\nIndian Ocean quake off coast of Sumatra: April 11, 2012\n\nAn 8.6 quake off the coast of Sumatra on April 11, 2012, was one of two quakes in the Indian Ocean that struck near Indonesia, felt across the islands of Sumatra and Java, and widely felt in parts of South and Southeast Asia\n\nThe first quake registered at a magnitude of 8.6 at about 3:38 p.m. local time. It killed two people and at least eight died from heart attacks attributed to the quake. A dozen more were injured in the Indonesian province Aceh. Just over two hours later, another quake of 8.2 magnitude was felt in the same region and even triggered a local tsunami.\n\nAssam-Tibet earthquake: Aug. 15, 1950\n\nAn Aug. 15, 1950, earthquake caused destruction in India and Tibet with a magnitude of 8.6, recalculated from an earlier designation of 8.7. More than 1,500 people were killed, including hundreds who died days after the quake when a dam broke. The quake triggered landslides that wiped out whole villages.\n\nRat Islands earthquake: Feb. 4, 1965\n\nAn 8.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Rat Islands, a group of Alaskan islands within the Aleutian Islands, on Feb. 4, 1965, also triggering a tsunami. Damage was reported to structures from the impact of the earthquake and subsequent flooding, but no deaths were reported.\n\nKamchatka Peninsula earthquake: July 29, 2025\n\nOn Tuesday, July 29, 2025, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula about 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said preliminary information indicates there were no injuries but that a kindergarten building was damaged, according to Reuters. The quake generated a tsunami of up to 13 feet in Russia and prompted tsunami alerts in Japan, Hawaii and the entire U.S. West Coast.\n\nEcuador-Colombia quake: Jan. 31, 1906\n\nNear the coast of Ecuador on Jan. 31, 1906, an 8.8 quake caused a tsunami that killed between 500 and 1,500 people in Ecuador and Colombia. Its magnitude has been recalculated after being originally estimated at 8.2. The tsunami reached Hilo, Hawaii, over 5,000 miles away 12.5 hours later.\n\nChilean earthquake: Feb. 27, 2010\n\nMore than 500 people were killed and over two dozen were declared missing, another 12,000 were injured and hundreds of thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed in an 8.8 earthquake and tsunami near Quirihue, Chile, on Feb. 27, 2010. The quake was felt across much of South America.\n\nMore than 800,000 people were displaced from their homes. The economic loss was estimated at $30 billion. The tsunami even reached San Diego, California, where it damaged boats docked there.\n\nQuake near Kamchatka, Russia: Nov. 4, 1952\n\nA 9.0 quake off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, triggered a tsunami that caused serious damage and killed at least 4,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami made its way through the Pacific Ocean, causing up to $1 million of damage in Hawaii, where the waves destroyed boats and piers and killed six cows.\n\nJapan earthquake and tsunami: March 11, 2011\n\nThe Great Tohoku Earthquake struck Japan on March 11, 2011, with a magnitude of 9.1 which also triggered a catastrophic tsunami that hit within 30 minutes of the quake. The tsunami disabled three nuclear reactors, causing a nuclear disaster. Hundreds of fires also broke out as a result.\n\nMore than 18,000 people died, including thousands never found but presumed dead, and over 6,000 were injured. More than 100,000 homes were totally destroyed and almost a million more were damaged, mostly due to the tsunami. Damage was recorded from the tsunami around the world, including in Hawaii, California, Peru, and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nSumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake: Dec. 26, 2004\n\nA 9.1-magnitude earthquake and tsunami off the west coast of northern Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, killed more than 283,000 people and displaced over 1 million more across 10 countries in Asia and Africa.\n\n\"The tsunami caused more casualties than any other in recorded history and was recorded nearly world-wide on tide gauges in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,\" the U.S. Geological Survey site said.\n\nGreat Alaska Earthquake: March 27, 1964\n\nAlso known as the Good Friday Earthquake, a 9.2 quake in southern Alaska and tsunami killed 131 people and caused over $2 billion in damage across the cities of Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer, Hope and many others in Alaska. A J.C.

Meanwhile, authorities in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands have ordered a precautionary evacuation for residents living in vulnerable areas along the Pacific coast, according to Reuters.\n\nMore on sea lions on the island\n\nThe island affected by the earthquake is home to Steller sea lions, the largest members of the family Otariidae, which includes \"eared seals,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.\n\nThe species was named after German surgeon and naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who described it in 1742, according to NOAA Fisheries.\n\nThe seals can be found mainly along the North Pacific Ocean rim from northern Hokkaido, Japan, to the Kuril Islands and Sea of Okhotsk. They can also be found in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, the southern coast of Alaska and south to central California.\n\nAdult males tend to be much larger than females, the agency said. Adult males can be up to 11 feet long and can weigh up to 2,500 pounds, while adult females are 7.5 to 9.5 feet long and weigh up to 800 pounds.\n\nThey primarily feed at night and consume over 100 species of fish, including mackerel, walleye pollock, salmon, Pacific cod, flounder and others. They can forage both nearshore and offshore, and can travel long distances within a single season.\n\nDisturbances and how they impact sea lions\n\nThe creatures need “undisturbed land habitat to rest, molt, socialize, mate, give birth, and nurse small pups during the breeding season,” NOAA Fisheries said.\n\nThe agency also said Steller sea lions have been disturbed in the past by powerboats, kayaks, paddleboards and other watercraft, as well as approaching aircraft..\n\n“Disturbance to Steller sea lions on terrestrial haulout sites can lead to individuals fleeing toward the water, causing mass stampedes during which pups and juveniles may be injured or killed when crushed by adults,” the agency said. “Disturbance can also cause sea lions to flee from the tops of steep rocks or cliff faces, also causing injury or death.”\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Gavin Newsom, who is considered a possible 2028 Democratic presidential contender himself.\n\nPolitico first reported Harris' timetable for a decision on seeking the Democratic nomination for California governor, which would almost certainly take herself out of the 2028 presidential sweepstakes if she wins and succeeds Newsom in the governor's office.\n\nHarris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, has kept a relatively low public profile since her loss to President Donald Trump in November. But she spoke last month at the the NAACP Image Awards in Pasadena, California, broadcast by Black Entertainment Television, where she was awarded the organization's Chairman's Award.\n\n\"While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter of our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the Oval Office nor by the wealthiest among us,\" Harris said in a reference to Trump and White House senior adviser Elon Musk, the world's richest person.\n\nHarris mounted a snapshot 107-day campaign for president, quickly emerging as the Democratic nominee after former President Joe Biden's exit from the 2024 race. She initially erased polling leads Trump had over Biden, but the momentum was short-lived as Harris ultimately lost all seven closely contested battleground states to Trump. Harris struggled to distance herself from Biden's poor approval ratings and convince Americans tired of the status quo that she represented change.\n\nHarris, who lost her bid to be the first Black female U.S. president, would be the first Black female governor of a U.S. state if she were to win.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., is considering a run for California governor. Other Democrats who have announced their candidacies are former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former California state Senate Leader Toni Atkins, state schools superintendent Tony Thurmond and the state's former comptroller, Betty Yee. Most if not all these contenders, however, probably would bow out if Harris runs, Politico reported.\n\nHarris has won statewide elections in California three times before. The first came in 2010, when she was narrowly elected state attorney general by less than 1 percentage point. She was reelected in 2014.

Brian Kemp, a staunch Republican with bipartisan appeal who many saw as the strongest potential challenger to incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, has announced that he will not be running for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2026.\n\nThe announcement comes after months of speculation over the future of his political career. Kemp, who has been Georgia’s governor since 2019, is unable to seek a third consecutive term under Georgia’s state constitution. Republican leaders in Georgia and across the nation have urged him to run for Senate, where wavering Democratic turnout may allow Republicans to unseat Ossoff. The most recent poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed Ossoff trailing Kemp by three points if he were to run for the seat, making Kemp the most formidable Republican opponent at this stage in the election cycle.\n\nHowever, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Kemp said that after consulting with supporters and Republican leadership, he ultimately decided against running.\n\n“I greatly appreciate their support and prayers for our family,” Kemp wrote, adding, “after those discussions, I have decided that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family.”\n\nThe announcement also comes as a boon for Ossoff, who is approaching the end of his first term in the Senate and will likely be facing fierce Republican efforts to unseat him. While no major Republicans have announced a Senate bid yet, figures like Insurance Commissioner John King, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter may soon enter the fray.\n\nHowever, Kemp will likely still be front and center in Georgia politics throughout the 2026 campaign cycle. In his announcement, he added that he would be working with leaders in Washington to support the eventual Republican nominee for Senate.\n\n“I spoke with President Trump and Senate leadership earlier today and expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November, and ultimately be a conservative voice in the US Senate who will put hardworking Georgians first,” he said. “I am confident we will be united in that important effort, and I look forward to electing the next generation of leaders up and down the ballot here in the Peach State who will keep our state and nation headed in the right direction in 2026 and beyond.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/11/kim-reynolds-will-not-run-for-reelection-iowa-governor/83042852007/", "title": "Kim Reynolds will not run for reelection as Iowa governor", "text": "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced on social media Friday she will not seek reelection to another term — an unexpected move that resets the state's political landscape ahead of a 2026 midterm election year.\n\n\"Today, I want to share a personal decision with you. One that was not made lightly, but comes with a full heart and a deep sense of gratitude,\" she said in a simple, straight-to-camera video. \"After a lot of thought, prayer and conversations with my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in 2026.\"\n\nReynolds, 65, noted in the video that her family has supported her \"through every challenge and every victory.\"\n\n\"Now, it’s time for me to be there for them,\" she said. \"To help them through the next stage of life. To watch every track meet and basketball game; to see them grow before they’re all grown. That doesn’t mean I’m slowing down just yet. I’ll be working hard for you every single day until my term ends.\"\n\nReynolds' husband, Kevin, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2023, although she told reporters in 2024 he was doing well after receiving treatment.\n\nReynolds began her career in public service as a clerk in the Clarke County Treasurer’s Office and then was elected county treasurer.\n\nShe served under Republican Gov. Terry Branstad as his lieutenant governor beginning in 2011, and she succeeded him to the top post in 2017 after he resigned to serve in President Donald Trump's first administration as ambassador to China.\n\nShe became Iowa's first female governor and won election to her first full term in 2018. She was reelected in a landslide victory in 2022.\n\nFrom the archive: Kim Reynolds becomes Iowa's first female governor\n\nKim Reynolds transformed Iowa through tax code, education policy and more\n\nReynolds has overseen transformational change in Iowa during her tenure as governor, reshaping the state’s tax code, education system and executive branch structure.\n\nDuring her time in office, Iowa has gone from an 8.98% top income tax rate down to a 3.8% flat tax that kicked in for all income taxpayers on Jan. 1, giving Iowa the sixth-lowest income tax rate in the country among those that have an income tax.\n\nReynolds has also signed laws eliminating Iowa’s inheritance tax, making retirement income tax-free and cutting corporate and property taxes.\n\nIn all, Reynolds has boasted that the tax cuts she has signed into law will reduce Iowans’ taxes by $24 billion over a decade.\n\nHer changes to Iowa’s education system have been just as significant.\n\nThe centerpiece of Reynolds’ education agenda is a universal “school choice” law that makes every Iowa family eligible for thousands of dollars of taxpayer-funded scholarships to pay for private school expenses. The program will be open to every family, regardless of income, in the coming school year.\n\nReynolds finally signed the law in 2023 after a three-year battle with reluctant House Republicans that saw the governor work to oust several sitting GOP lawmakers by endorsing their primary challengers.\n\nReynolds has worked for years to cut down the size of state government, signing into law a reorganization of the state’s executive branch in 2023 that slashed the number of cabinet-level agencies from 37 to 16, eliminated hundreds of open positions and gave the governor more direct control over executive branch employees.\n\nThe next year, she signed a law eliminating dozens of state boards and commissions.\n\nShe's also made strides in limiting abortion access in the state and removing civil rights protections for transgender Iowans.\n\nReynolds seemed to find her footing as governor through the COVID-19 pandemic. She told the Des Moines Register in a 2023 interview that she emerged both more confident and more willing to stand firm under intense scrutiny and pressure.\n\n“I came out a different governor,” she said. “I really believe that.”\n\nAfter shutting down businesses and schools in the pandemic’s early months, Reynolds was at the forefront as Republican governors around the country pushed to get kids back in the classrooms, ban mask mandates and push back against vaccine mandate.\n\nThe pandemic claimed the lives of more than 10,000 Iowans.\n\nReynolds seemed to reach the peak of her political power following the pandemic and the 2022 elections.\n\nBut she took a risk endorsing a candidate ahead of the 2024 Republican presidential caucuses, putting her thumb on the scale for friend and fellow governor, Ron DeSantis of Florida.\n\nIt earned her the ire of Trump, who called her \"disloyal\" and pledged it would be \"the end of her political career.\"\n\nBut Reynolds endorsed Trump going into the general election, and she has joined him multiple times in Washington, D.C., to celebrate advancing his agenda. Trump has thanked Reynolds for her leadership in the state.\n\nRepublican leaders offer praise for Kim Reynolds after announcement not to seek reelection\n\nImmediately after her announcement, praise for the governor began pouring in from her Republican allies across the state.\n\n“Gov. Reynolds has been a generational leader for our state and party,\" Republican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement. \"Under her bold, conservative leadership, Iowa now sits as one of the best states in the entire country. Taxes are low, cash reserves are full, our freedoms defended, and Iowa’s future has never been brighter.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra issued a statement congratulating Reynolds, saying she \"exemplified the endless possibilities of bold, conservative leadership.\"\n\n“Serving with Gov. Reynolds in the state Senate and working with her to pass the largest income tax cut in state history at the time, I saw firsthand her love for Iowa and her devotion to our families and communities,\" he said. \"She quickly became a close friend.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson called Reynolds \"the best governor in America.\"\n\n\"Iowa has been blessed by her leadership, and I have been blessed by her friendship,\" she said. \"The impact she leaves will be immeasurable and countless lives have been made better because of her tireless service. I join every Iowan in saying thank you — we are all grateful for your love of Iowa and your dedication to our state.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn called Reynolds an \"inspiration\" both for his own daughters and \"girls across our state.\"\n\n\"Governor Reynolds led Iowa to prosperity with commonsense, solutions from tax cuts to economic growth,\" he said in a statement. \"She helped me fight human trafficking & fentanyl in Iowa, balance our state’s budget and help make Iowa one of the best places to raise a family.\"\n\nAnd U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks called Reynolds a \"trailblazer.\"\n\n\"Under her leadership, Iowa became one of the best managed states, cutting taxes, shrinking bureaucracy, and creating a national model for efficient and effective government,\" Miller-Meeks said in a statement. \"And Iowa is now one of the best states to retire in.\"\n\nDemocrats look ahead to reset 2026 gubernatorial campaign\n\nDemocrats in the state have been hoping to strongly contest the governor's race in 2026, particularly in a midterm year when national political dynamics have historically favored the party that doesn't control the White House.\n\nOn Friday, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart issued a statement looking forward to the next election cycle.\n\n“Iowa Republicans’ decade in control of state government has left Iowa 49th in economic growth and with a $900 million budget deficit thanks to taxpayer handouts to special interests and vouchers for wealthy families who already send their kids to private schools,\" she said. \"In 2026, voters will get to hold them accountable for taking our state in the wrong direction. It’s time to vote for a governor who will put Iowans to work, lower costs and support our rural areas.”\n\nIowa's lone Democrat elected to statewide office, Auditor Rob Sand, is expected to run make a run for governor though he has made no formal announcement.\n\nSand announced earlier that he had raised more than $8 million during 2024, giving him a formidable war chest that overshadowed even with Reynolds had raised as an incumbent.\n\nBoosted by $7 million in donations from his wife and in-laws, Sand tallied about $8.6 million in receipts between January and December of last year, and he entered 2025 with about $7.5 million in cash on hand.\n\nIn a social media post, Sand wished Reynolds well in retirement.\n\n\"Public office is a demanding path in a way that few truly understand,\" he said. \"I wish Gov. Reynolds and her family well in retirement.\"\n\nIowa House Democratic Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, said in a statement that “Iowans are ready to turn the page on Kim Reynolds’ legacy of division and politics.\"\n\nKonfrst has said she's considering running for Congress in the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Des Moines.\n\n\"After a decade of failed leadership, there’s a reason Reynolds is the least popular governor in America: Iowans are worse off than they were a decade ago,\" she said. \"It’s time for a governor who will build an economy that works for everyone. It’s time for a governor who knows that public money is for public schools. It’s time for a governor who will bring balance and common sense back to Iowa. It’s time for a governor who will put people over politics.”\n\nWhat Republicans will run for governor in Kim Reynolds' place?\n\nRepublican Brad Sherman, a Williamsburg pastor and former state representative, announced in February he would run for governor in 2026, regardless of what Reynolds chose to do.\n\nSherman was an early endorser of Trump ahead of the 2024 GOP presidential caucuses. He was expected to run to the political right of Reynolds on issues such as eminent domain and the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Reynolds' decision to bow out is expected to open the floodgates to a rush of potential Republican contenders who wouldn't have challenged the incumbent Reynolds for the seat.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement congratulating Reynolds and hinting that she would be considering a run herself.\n\n\"In the weeks ahead, Bob and I will pray and consider what this decision means for our future,\" she said in a statement. \"I appreciate the calls of encouragement I've already received. I am committed to continuing my work on behalf of Iowans and to support President Trump as he works to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nFormer Trump campaign advisor Chris LaCivita quickly posted to social media encouraging Bird, a 2024 Trump endorser, to run for governor.\n\nTrump lauded Bird on the night of his 2024 Iowa Caucus win, telling the crowd during his victory speech: \"She's going to be your governor someday.\"\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Mike Lawler passes on 2026 governor run, announces ...", "text": "Rep. Mike Lawler will forgo a run for governor in 2026, shelving a political ambition he had publicly weighed since last year and opting to run instead for a third House term.\n\nLawler, a second-term Republican from Rockland County, announced his decision in media interviews on Wednesday, July 23, first reported by the New York Times. He told the Times he would \"continue the important work\" he has been doing in Congress, despite feeling he was \"best positioned take on Kathy Hochul and offer New Yorkers a real choice for governor.\"\n\nLawler's decision clears a path for now for Rep. Elise Stefanik, a fellow New Yorker who has been flirting with the governor's race since April but still has announced no decision. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is also seen as a potential GOP candidate for governor.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who has led the state since 2021, is gearing up to seek a second four-year term next year. Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, the former congressman she tapped to fill that vacant office before her first re-election run in 2022, has launched a campaign to challenge her in a Democratic primary in June 2026.\n\nPassing up a run for governor leaves another tough contest for Lawler: seeking re-election in a battleground House district Democrats are itching to flip. A big field of seven Democratic contenders has formed to run in 2026 for New York's 17th Congressional district, which takes in all or parts of four Hudson Valley counties.\n\nRepublican House leaders had urged Lawler to run for re-election rather than governor to help them hold their slim majority after the next election. Having a GOP newcomer rather than a well-funded incumbent in the race would given Democrats a better chance of winning an already competitive district. Who would have replaced Lawler as the Republican candidate was unclear.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday morning, Stefanik said she'll announce her decision about the governor's race after this November's elections for county and local races in New York. She praised Lawler for his work in Congress and commitment to \"protecting the House Republican Majority.\"\n\n\"Republicans are more unified than ever in our mission to fire the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul in 2026,\" Stefanik said in her statement.\n\nKevin Donohoe, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, traced Lawler's decision to President Donald Trump's endorsement of Lawler in May for re-election to his House seat, seen as a signal he preferred Stefanik run for governor.\n\n“Donald Trump has officially killed Mike Lawler’s dream of becoming governor of New York and given the GOP gubernatorial nomination to his top D.C. ally Elise Stefanik,\" Donohoe said. \"Our condolences.”\n\nDecision boiled down to one main factor: could Lawler win?\n\nThe 38-year-old Lawler has said in interviews that he shared his party leaders' concerns about holding his House seat if he ran for governor. But the chief factor in his decision, he said, would be the strictly numerical calculation of whether he had a \"pathway\" to victory in a heavily Democratic state, even against a governor he harshly rebukes and sees as vulnerable.\n\n\"When all is said and done, the question to me is, is there really a pathway?\" he said during a May 19 podcast with Sid Rosenberg, a conservative talk-show host.\n\nLawler pointed out then that former Rep. Lee Zeldin fared relatively well for a Republican when he ran against Hochul in 2022, but he still lost to her by 350,000 votes. And likewise, President Donald Trump did better in New York last year than he did in 2020 but wound up losing the state to Kamala Harris by a whopping 1 million votes.\n\n\"So it's really, it's a question of the numbers more than anything else,\" Lawler said then.\n\nThere was also the question of whether he could first beat the better-known Stefanik in a GOP primary, if it came to that. Stefanik, a staunch Trump ally who once declared herself \"ultra-MAGA,\" holds obvious appeal for the GOP base. But Lawler, who is seen as a moderate and often touts his bipartisan bill work, has pitched himself as a stronger candidate because he could win over voters other than Republicans.\n\n\"You can’t win a statewide election in New York just by pounding your chest and saying that you’re the most MAGA candidate,\" he told Rosenberg in a June 4 interview on WABC radio, in what seemed a snipe at Stefanik.\n\nIn that same conversation, Lawler ruled out both a \"kamikaze mission\" — a governor's race he knows he couldn't win — and a primary against Stefanik for that office.\n\n“A primary’s not going to serve anyone’s interest here,\" he said. \"All it’s going to do is waste time, money and effort. The focus has to be on defeating Kathy Hochul.”\n\nStefanik held a huge edge over Lawler in a Siena College poll in late June. Stefanik led him by 35%-18% among Republican voters in a hypothetical three-way GOP primary for governor, with Blakeman a distant third at 7% and a hefty 39% of surveyed voters taking no position.\n\nThe same poll found an uphill battle for any of those potential Republican challengers in a general election. Hochul led all three by 20 points or more in separate head-to-head matchups.\n\nWhere does this leave the House race?\n\nEven before publicly taking himself out of the governor's race, Lawler appeared to be refocusing on re-election. On June 24, his House campaign blast-texted an invitation to a fundraiser Lawler in Putnam County on June 30 — the last day to beef up the cash total it could boast on in its next financial report.\n\nDemocrats gunning for his seat now know for sure who their target is. Seven in all have launched campaigns. Whichever candidates remain in the race will compete for the nomination in a June 2026 primary.\n\nA spokewoman for the House Democrats' campaign arm said Lawler will now have to defend his record of \"rubberstamping Trump's extreme agenda\" in his re-election race.\n\n“The only thing more embarrassing than Lawler’s failed fantasy campaign for governor is the brutal loss he’s about to face at home,\" said Riya Vashi of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nDemocrats flipped three Republican-held House seats in New York in 2024, and for the next election they've trained their sights on Lawler's 17th District. For now, a year before their party's nominee is elected, political handicappers at the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball give Lawler the edge, rating the 17th District as \"leans Republican.\"\n\nDemocrats now jostling to take him on next year accused him of bowing to Trump's will and \"his DC bosses\" in statements after Lawler's decision was reported.\n\n“This morning Mike Lawler confirmed what we all knew: he does whatever Donald Trump tells him to do,\" 17th District candidate Beth Davidson said. \"I welcome him to the race.\"\n\nChris McKenna covers government and politics for The Journal News and USA Today Network.

The conglomerate behind Skippy and Jennie-O turkey says it can’t make Spam fast enough and is increasing production capacity.\n\nSpam is a trending ingredient on TikTok and on the menu at fine-dining restaurants in coastal cities. In 2019, a limited-edition Spam pumpkin spice flavor sold out in minutes. (You can still buy it on Ebay, where it goes for up to $100 per can.)\n\nWhat is behind this phenomenon? Why does this slab of cooked pork that has long been stigmatized as fake meat, linked to wartime rations and hilariously spoofed on Monty Python now have cachet with foodies?\n\nSpam’s popularity in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine has influenced its growth in the United States. As more immigrants came to the United States and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream, Spam has reached new, younger foodies, say Hormel, food analysts and researchers.\n\nEdgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it, sometimes reluctantly.\n\n“Spam has undergone a reputation makeover,” said Robert Ku, an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of “Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA.” “A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American, and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.”\n\n‘Miracle meat’\n\nMore than 100,000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin, Minnesota, with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share, said Savile Lord, the manager of the museum in the brand’s hometown.

Josh Noel/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSpam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 12-ounce, 25-cent, convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder, chopped ham, water, sugar and sodium.\n\nIt was a concoction of George Hormel and his son, Jay, meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the “problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it,” Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.\n\nThey offered a $100 prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.\n\nThe brother of a corporate executive threw out “Spam,” a combination of “spice” and “ham,” at a party, and Hormel “knew then and there that the name was perfect.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans, spaghetti, macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.\n\nA pie made with Spam-brand canned meat, potatoes, scallions, and cream of mushroom soup during the 1950s or 1960s. Tom Kelley/Getty Images\n\n“Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning, noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!” read one early advertisement. Spam was a “miracle meat,” the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.\n\nAnd then came the United States’ entrance into World War II in 1941, the decisive moment in Spam’s growth.\n\nAt many Pacific outposts, which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat, American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.\n\nHormel says more than 100 million pounds of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam, much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.\n\n“During World War II, of course, I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers,” Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel’s president. “I’ll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.”\n\nFor the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years, however, Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes, it was the only protein source available. After US troops left, Spam remained, becoming an ingredient in local dishes.\n\n“Spam became part of Asian culture,” said Ayalla Ruvio, a consumer behavior researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. “It represented a piece of America. It’s like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.”\n\nAmerican troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed, such as Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn Hawaii, where the US military has long been a major presence, more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It’s stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald’s in Hawaii. There’s even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.\n\nSpam musubi and tacos\n\nMany US soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again, and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in the United States in recent years.\n\nSpam musubi, a common Japanese lunch dish that was created in Hawaii.

As more people have been introduced to these dishes, they go home and try to make their own versions, Lillis said.\n\nSpam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs, as well as Spam fried rice, Spam musubi, yakitori, and poke.\n\nSpam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways, said Ku, the Binghamton University professor. “They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/01/09/liv-schmidt-tiktok-ban-skinny-influencers-young-people/77549597007/", "title": "Liv Schmidt, TikTok ban and why skinny influencers are so dangerous", "text": "Her name? Liv Schmidt. Her brand? Being skinny.\n\nWhile most fitness and lifestyle creators veer away from equating health and thinness, Schmidt built a platform saying the quiet part out loud, growing a following of 670,000 on TikTok before she was barred from the platform in September.\n\n“Basic fit because the accessory is being blonde & skinny,” she captioned one outfit video. “Please don’t ask me how I’m so skinny if you’re not ready for the answers,” she wrote over another.\n\nHer supporters say she’s “just telling the truth,” but mental health experts warn content like hers can negatively impact young users’ perceptions of body image and influence disordered eating habits – and say it’s part of a larger shift in how Americans are discussing thinness. The key to combatting this is raising parents' awareness about the conversations happening online.\n\n“We're almost seeing a return to the outward profession of the desire to be skinny, whereas for a while it's been, ‘I want to be healthier, I want to engage in wellness,’” said University of Vermont associate professor Lizzy Pope, whose research focuses on how diet culture appears in popular culture and on social media. “What I'm seeing is a return of that language being accepted.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWho is Liv Schmidt, and why was she banned from TikTok?\n\nSchmidt, 23, rose to popularity last year through her candid discussions of achieving thinness, in series like her “living slim in the city” videos and her “Holiday Meal Skinny Girl Guide.\" With an Instagram profile featuring polished photos donning matching workout sets to Pilates and enjoying New York City dining and nightlife, she markets thinness as an essential part of being an “it girl.”\n\nThe creator opened up about her ideology in a Wall Street Journal profile last year, where she discussed limiting calories and defended her content.\n\nHer LinkedIn states that she works as a Social Event Coordinator at a Private Family office in New York City. She attended the University of Arizona, where she told the Journal she experienced pressure to fit the \"blonde and skinny\" stereotype.\n\n“Weight is a touchy topic, but that’s what the viewers want,\" she said.\n\nTikTok banned Schmidt’s account for violating the site's community guidelines, according to the Journal. A TikTok spokesperson did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on specifics, but some of Schmidt's videos appeared to violate the site's disordered eating and body image guidelines, which prohibit content that \"promotes potentially harmful weight management.\"\n\nShe’s still barred from the app, but has continued posting Instagram reels to her 129,000 followers and the 1,600 subscribers to her exclusive content, which she sells for $19.99 a month. She also shared 86 new videos to YouTube with titles like “Bye bye thunder thighs … hello slim legs.\"\n\nSchmidt has addressed the backlash on her account in November, stating in one caption, “I’m not problematic, you’re just too sensitive.”\n\nSchmidt declined USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nThe rise in 'skinny' content can influence disordered eating in young people\n\nTikTok has guidelines in place to restrict harmful weight-related content. But users have maneuvered around them, posting pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia content under sneakily named hashtags and covert “what I eat in a day” videos that often portray unhealthy caloric intake.\n\nThe most widely viewed food, nutrition and weight content on the app are videos that perpetuate toxic diet culture among teens and young adults, according to a 2022 University of Vermont study that analyzed the top 100 videos from popular nutrition, food and weight-related hashtags.\n\nPope, one of the study’s coauthors, said representation of diet culture and weight loss was framed as a part of being healthy or being fit in most of the videos they analyzed. If they did the study again in 2025, she suspects they would find “a lot more of this very blatant, ‘I'm doing this to be skinny’ content.”\n\nThe problem with taking advice from nonexpert creators, according to Pope, is that their one-size-fits-all advice doesn’t consider genetics and reflects a misunderstanding of how eating disorders develop, which is often “piece by piece” instead of from an all-at-once mentality.\n\nFactors like social media and isolation have contributed to a large increase in youth eating disorders since the pandemic. The growing aspiration to skinniness is amplified by discourse surrounding drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic, whose usage has surged, particularly among women.\n\nIs 'skinny' making a comeback? Pilates, low-rise jeans and Kardashian weight loss\n\nPope said videos like Schmidt’s are “like siren songs” for insecure young adults, and make it seem “like the best idea” or “the easiest thing” to go on diets. But mimicking this behavior and expecting similar results could set young adults up for disappointment or disordered eating habits.\n\nWhat parents can do to counter toxic online diet culture\n\nDiet culture and disordered eating is always reinventing its buzzwords and formats, whether it was '90s supermodel Kate Moss’s mantra \"Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels\" or the prevalence of eating disorder Tumblr in the 2010s. Even if TikTok is banned, Pope warned the same content will replicate on other platforms as long as skinniness is seen as an indicator of societal status and health.\n\nSchmidt's not alone – though she may be one of the most prominent, other skinny influencers exist online. Pope said parents of teenagers should assume their child will see this type of content and recommends proactively addressing diet talk and creating a home environment that fosters strong value outside of appearance. She clarified that it's important not to make presumptions about a thin person's body size, and that the problem comes in when someone is giving advice without medical backing about how to become skinny.\n\n“Open a dialogue of, ‘Hey, do you ever see nutrition content? Or do you ever see anything about eating on your FYP? Do you ever see anything about weight loss on your FYP?’” Pope said.\n\nIn general, the best way to minimize similar content is not to interact with it in the first place, since commenting or liking videos makes similar content more likely to appear in one’s algorithm. Pope said working on the ability to reject content is an important aspect of making sure toxic diet culture doesn’t permeate one’s mental health, and recommended seeking professional support through therapists and dietitians if unhealthy thoughts persist.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with body image or eating concerns, the National Eating Disorders Association's toll-free and confidential helpline is available by phone or text at 1-800-931-2237 or by click-to-chat message at nationaleatingdisorders.org/helpline.

But their ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: The past year was filled with uncertainty over politics, the economy and the ongoing pandemic. In the face of big changes, people found themselves longing for a different time. CNN’s series “The Past Is Now” examines how nostalgia manifested in our culture in 2022 — for better or for worse.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn certain corners of the internet, a segment of women is exhibiting a nostalgia for an era it has never known.\n\nThese millennials and zoomers glamorize the aesthetics of 1950s Americana, donning retro fit-and-flare dresses and posting vintage illustrations of aproned housewives placing dinner on the table.\n\nTheir politics, too, hearken back to that of the post-World War II boom (at least, for those who were straight, White and middle class). In their ideal society, men are the providers, women are the homemakers and the nuclear family is the holy grail.\n\nThese young women belong to a small subculture called “tradwives.” Short for traditional wives, tradwives aren’t your average stay-at-home moms. They sneer at what they consider to be modern-day feminism, with its girlbosses and its ungratifying grind, and wax lyrical about the value of traditional gender roles. Crucially, they promote submission to one’s husband, sometimes evoking fundamentalist Christian principles in their beliefs.\n\nAs tradwives showcase their idyllic, domesticated lives on social media, implicit is the message that today’s women and girls are being “red pilled” by the feminist movements that promise to liberate them – and that true security and fulfillment can be achieved by reverting to certain norms of the past.\n\nTradwives are a fringe subculture\n\nIn the grand scheme of internet phenomena, tradwives are a fringe group.\n\nOnline mentions of tradwives go at least as far back as five years ago, but 2020 saw a noticeable uptick in usage of the term, according to Deborah Etienne, a data analyst and researcher for the social media marketing agency Brandwatch. The tradwife discourse continued to grow in 2022 as tradwife content across social media increased and media outlets subsequently covered the trend. But while Etienne found about 152,000 mentions of tradwives across Tumblr, Twitter, Reddit, forums and blogs over the last year, negative mentions overwhelmingly outnumbered positive ones – suggesting a strong backlash is present, too.\n\nThough the numbers of self-identified tradwives are low, social media has allowed them to reach sizable audiences. The 10 to 15 largest tradwife accounts have tens of thousands of followers across Instagram and YouTube, according to an analysis from Political Research Associates, a think tank focused on the US political right.\n\nTradwives champion strict gender roles in which men are the providers and women are the homemakers. Debrocke/Classicstock/Getty Images\n\nWomen who associate with the label exist on a spectrum of sorts, with varying ideas about what it means to be a tradwife and varying reasons for promoting those ideas. Estee C. Williams, who is 24 and posts tradwife content on TikTok, said she doesn’t consider herself to be “super traditional” but implements traditional gender roles in her life and relationship – which she frames as a personal choice. She said she isn’t concerned with whether others adopt those same values, but is merely sharing her lifestyle with others who want to embark on a similar path.\n\n“I love the ’50s aesthetic with my own modern twist on homemaking,” she told CNN. “The difference is that we have the choice. Women can choose not to be homemakers or work, or have a mix.”\n\nBritish author and blogger Alena Kate Pettitt, meanwhile, has written on her website The Darling Academy about what she feels tradwives are not, while noting that her intent isn’t to indoctrinate other women.\n\n“Though a traditional housewife may submit to her husband, she is not considered of lesser importance to him,” she wrote in one post. By Pettitt’s definition, a tradwife isn’t opposed to women’s rights but “openly rejects the side of feminism that is man-hating, takes a victim mentality in all things, and promotes that ‘The Future is Female.’”\n\nAnd she writes that a tradwife doesn’t want to go back to the 1950s, but “she simply likes that time because it was the last time her occupation was celebrated in mainstream media.”\n\nTheir ideas aren’t particularly new\n\nWomen who advocate for strictly traditional gender roles aren’t a new phenomenon – anti-feminists in the early 19th and 20th centuries resisted women’s suffrage, and some activists in the late 20th century opposed the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nWhat sets tradwives apart from their predecessors is the visibility those social media platforms afford them, said Catherine Rottenberg, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham whose work examines neoliberal feminism.\n\nTradwife influencers package their ideas about the natural order of things into blog posts and bite-sized content and, in some cases, monetize their efforts. Pettitt shares Yorkshire pudding recipes and etiquette tips alongside posts titled “Your husband should always come first!” and “Men are not toxic: A year of advocating traditional family values.”\n\n“The movement, more generally, depends on savvy entrepreneurial women like these, who – through their social media activities, classes, courses, advice books and products – advocate and popularize tradwifehood as a desirable choice and identity,” Rottenberg wrote in an email to CNN, borrowing from a 2020 piece she and her colleague Shani Orgad wrote for The Conversation.\n\nShe added, “Far from rejecting neoliberal capitalism, the tradwife movement is deeply embedded in it.”\n\nTradwives reflect an anxiety around societal shifts\n\nFive years after #MeToo sparked a global conversation around sexual violence, sexism and power, it might seem puzzling that a life of traditional gender roles and submission to a male partner is resonating with some young women.\n\nBut in longing for the culture of 1950s domesticity, these women are responding to our current political moment, said Rottenberg. While the “Lean In,” girlboss movement of the early 2010s encouraged women to do more and work harder, critics characterized it as elitist and out of touch. By the time the pandemic hit, women were up against an “always-on” work culture, stagnating wages and an eroded social safety net – with a now worsening caregiving crisis. In a society where women already shoulder the majority of unpaid domestic work, staying home to focus on the household full time might be preferable – though also a privileged choice.\n\n“If there is no reliable health care, if women are making less money than their partners due to the gender wage gap and if there is no decent child care, then women ramping off the career path and serving their husbands and children provides a Band-Aid to these larger crises – and provides this Band-Aid with ideological cover,” Rottenberg wrote.\n\nIndeed, burnout is one of the factors that Williams cites in her decision to become a tradwife. Though she always knew she wanted to be a mom, she said she felt pressured to pursue a career, taking on a challenging course load in college while also working a job. But Williams said balancing it all was exhausting, and she realized she didn’t want to experience the stress that her mother did as a single, working parent.\n\n“I didn’t want to see myself struggle that way, and I definitely didn’t want to see myself struggle in school and struggle in work,” Williams said. “I wanted to figure out what my purpose was. When I became a strong spiritual woman, I figured out myself.”\n\nTradwife influencers often share images of 1950s housewives on social media, while encouraging submission to one's husband. Debrocke/ClassicStock/Getty Images\n\nRather than recognizing crises of child care and overwork as structural problems, tradwives typically point the finger at feminism, Rottenberg said. It’s not particularly surprising that tradwives consider themselves to be anti-feminists, given that their fixed notions of gender and glorification of “alpha males” are precisely what many feminists have long fought against. But as Rottenberg sees it, the tradwife response reflects a particular failing in western liberal feminism rather than feminism writ large.\n\n“Liberal feminism advocated for middle-class women to join the workforce as part of an emancipatory agenda,” Rottenberg wrote. “But if the workplace is toxic, and makes us sick, then entering the workplace doesn’t feel very emancipatory.”\n\nIn championing so-called traditional values, tradwives also push against aspects of modern society, including hookup culture and the objectification of women. The idea of a man who protects and provides for his wife, then, might offer women a sense of control and stability, Rottenberg adds – though it’s worth noting that fixed gender roles in the ’50s did not offer relief from domestic abuse or overwork.\n\n“Precisely at a time when normative gender roles and dominant notions of sexuality have been challenged and in flux – while work life feels overwhelming – these ‘traditional’ values might seem like a refuge,” she wrote. “Against a world that feels completely out of control, defining strict gender roles might feel empowering for some women.”\n\nTradwife content is being adopted by the far right\n\nWhile tradwives are already a niche subculture, an even smaller faction of them are using tradwife content to spread more insidious ideas, says Annie Kelly, a journalist and researcher with expertise in anti-feminist and far right digital cultures.\n\nKelly describes the overlap between tradwives and far right movements as something of a Venn diagram. While there are some tradwives, including women of color, who simply hold conservative beliefs on the roles men and women should occupy in relationships, she said some on the alt right use tradwife aesthetics to recruit White women into the movement. Such influencers promote a contempt for modernity and feminism, as well as “a desire for an idealized and implicitly coded White past,” she said.\n\n“If you’re a White influencer who’s espousing these things, there will be a quite pleasing overlap with how many White supremacists configure gender politics, because it coincides with lots of the alt right theories about what has gone wrong in the West,” said Kelly, who is also the UK correspondent for the podcast QAnon Anonymous.\n\nSome tradwife accounts, for example, use rhetoric that nod to White nationalist ideas such as “replacement theory.” One tradwife influencer who goes by “Wife With A Purpose” came under fire in 2017 for reportedly issuing a “White baby challenge,” in which she encouraged her followers to have as many White babies as her. (References to the challenge have since been removed from her online presence.) More recently, a popular tradwife Instagram account posted a Time magazine cover featuring Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, labeling them as “beta male” and “modern woman,” respectively. “This is your sign to repopulate,” the accompanying text read.\n\nMany tradwives also share the far right’s views on LGBTQ relationships, using phrases like “the natural order” in reference to gender roles. Some promote homeschooling to avoid exposing their children to progressive ideas about sex education and gender identity, Kelly added.\n\nTradwife nostalgia for the fixed gender roles of the 1950s is rooted in an imaginary past, says professor Catherine Rottenberg. Debrocke/ClassicStock/Getty Images\n\nThough tradwives are a small subculture — and alt-right tradwives an even more fringe group — Kelly said it’s worth paying attention to how tradwife rhetoric has trickled into the mainstream.\n\n“How many of the women rallying against overturning Roe are over-educated, under-loved millennials who sadly return from protests to a lonely microwave dinner with their cats, and no bumble matches?” Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz tweeted, shortly after the Supreme Court’s draft opinion overturning the constitutional right to abortion leaked. The tweet echoed frequent tradwife talking points, Kelly said.\n\nTradwives speak to an anti-modernity sentiment that has been bubbling up in internet culture and beyond for years – and the aesthetics and politics of anti-modernity go beyond tradwife circles, she noted.\n\n“Conditions for young people are quite bad, frankly,” said Kelly, nodding to the slower economic growth that younger generations face today. “This pushes young people into a tendency to look back at the past with rose-tinted glasses.”\n\nBut this romanticized view of the past, Rottenberg said, is “completely fictive.”\n\n“All they need to do is to read Betty Friedan’s ‘The Feminine Mystique’ to see that their yearning for a simpler life is misplaced.”", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/success/return-to-office-inflation", "title": "'Lunchflation' is real.

And grocery store prices increased 10.8% for the year ended in April.\n\nOffice workers are seeing higher costs for everything from their morning coffee to their lunchtime salad: Starbucks raised prices in the US earlier this year and in October 2021 – and said prices could continue to rise.\n\n“We have additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year,” said then-CEO Kevin Johnson during an analyst call in February, citing cost pressures such as inflation.\n\nSalad chain Sweetgreen has raised its menu prices by 10% since the start of 2021, the company said in its most recent earnings report.\n\n“Lunchflation is 100% real, everything is more expensive,” said Kelly Yau McClay, who lives in Potomac, Maryland. “Before, you could get lunch for $7 to $12. Now there is no way you can get a decent lunch for less than $15.”\n\nYau McClay had just started a job doing branding and marketing for a real estate company as everything was shutting down in April 2020. She had been working remotely full-time until October 2021. But now she’s on a hybrid schedule, going in to the office three days a week, and estimates she spends around $30 to $35 a day on work-related expenses, like lunch, coffee and snack runs and parking.\n\nBut for other workers, returning to the office has brought some relief – at least on some fronts. Consumers changed the way they spent during the pandemic, with expenses like dining out at restaurants getting replaced with higher grocery bills and more meals at home.\n\nSoaring prices at the pump have caused Sara Hill to change her driving habits. Courtesy Sara Hill\n\nSara Hill, who works in the insurance industry in Buffalo, New York, saw her food budget increase when she and her four children were home full-time.\n\n“I was eating more food because I am closer to the kitchen… my food spending was still increasing because we were all home,” said Hill.\n\nAfter working remotely full-time during the height of the pandemic, she is now going in to the office two days a week.\n\nBefore the pandemic, she spent around $25 to $30 a day on breakfast and lunch when working from the office. But now, with many of the food businesses near her job closed, she regularly brings lunches with her.\n\n“I pretty much bring things from home, whether it’s leftovers or a cup of noodles to get me through the day.\n\nGetting to the office\n\nA return to commuting has also meant more gas usage.\n\nWith gas prices hitting record highs recently, it’s an expensive time to be filling up more frequently. According to AAA, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is now $4.60. In February 2020, it was $2.44.\n\nSoaring gas prices are forcing Mike Tobin (pictured here with his son) to shell out a lot more for his commute.

At the time, he said it cost about $40 to fill up the tank – but now it’s closer to $75.\n\n“My biggest driving thing is going to the office…everything else is really close to where we live,” said Tobin, who works for a wholesale electric distribution company.\n\nFor Hill, the higher prices at the pump have made her change her routines to try and fill her tank up just once a week. She fills her truck with premium gas, which she said costs between $110 to $120 a tank.\n\n“That is extremely crazy for gas,” said Hill. “I try to pack the days when I go to the office – if I can do anything right after work or on my hour lunch break I will try to squeeze things in because…it’s a day I am already driving.”\n\nShe tries not to leave her house on the three days she is working from home.\n\nFor Yau McClay, any day she goes into the office she has to pay for parking. It used to cost $1 per hour, but increased by 50 cents earlier this year. Now she is paying $12 a day – up from $8.\n\nDitching the comfy sweatpants and dressing up for the office again is also costly. Apparel prices were up 5.4% in April from the same time a year ago.\n\n“Now that I am going in to the office, I have to go buy new makeup sets – so I am spending money there when I wasn’t before,” said Yau McClay. “The things you used to spend money on, like hair cuts, makeup, manicure and pedicures and updating your wardrobe, those things were essentially on pause for two years. Yes, I was spending it before… I got so used to not spending that it was really nice.

Though child care tends to get cheaper as a child ages, a series of price increases has eaten into those savings, Yau McClay said.\n\n“Every time she got bumped up [to an older age group]…later, they would announce: ‘Sorry we have another price increase,’” Yau McClay said. “Between when we started there and now, the price [for her current class] has gone up almost $200 net.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/business/self-checkout-retail", "title": "Nobody likes self-checkout.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s.

John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line CNN Business 02:22\n\n“It’s an arms race.

Now they're not so sure | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nOver the past few years, a number of cities and some states enacted rules banning or restricting local police use of facial-recognition software. Now, in a handful of locations around the country, the controversial technology is making a comeback.\n\nThe city of New Orleans, which in 2020 passed an ordinance banning its police department from using facial-recognition software, decided in July to change course and allow its police officers to request permission from a superior to use facial-recognition software for violent crime investigations. The state of Virginia, meanwhile, outlawed local police and campus law enforcement use of facial recognition technology in 2021 and then approved a bill in March allowing its use by police in some situations. And in California, a law that went into effect in 2020 that temporarily forbid state and local law enforcement from using facial-recognition software in body cameras expires at the end of the year (it was enacted as a three-year rule, and an effort to make it permanent failed in the state’s senate).\n\nThere are no federal laws governing the use of facial-recognition technology, which has led states, cities, and counties to regulate it on their own in various ways, particularly when it comes to how law enforcement agencies can use it.\n\nGenerally, there are two types of facial-recognition software: one compares a photo of a person to those in a database of faces looking for a likely match (the kind of software police might use when investigating a crime, such as that sold by Clearview AI), while the other compares a photo of a person to one other image (the kind that is used when you open your iPhone with your face).\n\nThe technology has been used increasingly across the United States in recent years, but it has also been blasted by privacy and digital rights groups over privacy issues and other real and potential dangers: The technology has been shown to be less accurate when identifying people of color, and several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial recognition.\n\nTo Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the bans and subsequent changes represent a “pendulum swing.”\n\nAn NOPD officer stands before an empty Bourbon Street on February 16, 2021 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nRoughly two dozen facial-recognition bans of various types have been enacted in communities and a few states across the United States since 2019. Many of them came in 2020; as Schwartz pointed out, there was a push in favor of limiting police use of surveillance technology surrounding the protests that came in the wake of the fatal arrest of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in May of that year. Then, in the past year, “the pendulum has swung a bit more in the law-and-order direction,” he said.\n\n“In American politics there are swings between being afraid of government surveillance and being afraid of crime. And in the short term there seems to have been a swing in favor of fear of crime,” he said, adding that the EFF is “optimistic” that the overall trend is toward limiting government use of such surveillance technologies.\n\nReversals in New Orleans and Virginia\n\nWhen New Orleans approved a ban of facial-recognition technology in late 2020 as part of a broader ordinance to regulate numerous surveillance technologies in the city, six of the seven council members at the time voted in favor of it (one was absent). By contrast, when the votes were tallied in July for the ordinance that would allow police to use facial-recognition technology, four council members voted for it and two voted against it (one counsel member was absent).\n\nThe turnabout less than two years later comes after a rise in homicides, following a decline from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe new rule lets city police request the use of facial-recognition software to aid investigations related to a wide range of violent crimes, including murder, rape, kidnap, and robbery.\n\nIn a statement applauding the city council’s July 21 vote in favor of facial-recognition technology, New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said, “I am grateful that the women and men of the NOPD now have this valuable, force multiplying tool that will help take dangerous criminals off our streets.”\n\nYet Lesli Harris, a New Orleans city council member who opposed the July ordinance, is concerned about how the legislation could impact the civil rights of people in the city. “As a woman of color it’s hard for me to be in favor of facial recognition,” Harris said, pointing out that studies that have shown that the technology can be less accurate at recognizing people of color, and women of color in particular.\n\nIn Virginia, legislation that went into effect last July banned local law enforcement and campus police from using facial-recognition technology unless the state legislature first passed a rule allowing it. The state’s 2022 legislation, which became effective in July, essentially reverses that 2021 rule by allowing the use of the technology by local and campus police in certain situations.\n\nScott Surovell, a Virginia state senator who introduced the newer rule, said it is meant chiefly as a “lead generator” that police would have to independently corroborate before arresting a suspect. He also pointed out that, while the 2021 legislation stopped local police from using facial-recognition software, it didn’t prevent Virginia state law enforcement from doing so, or from using it on behalf of local police.\n\nThe 2022 legislation requires police agencies using facial-recognition software to publish a report each year about how it is being used. It also requires that police only use facial-recognition software that has been deemed at least 98% accurate across all demographics measured by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the US Commerce Department whose functions include measuring the accuracy of facial-recognition algorithms that companies and researchers submit to its lab.\n\nSeeking more guardrails\n\nIt’s still largely unknown how often facial-recognition technology is being used and where in the United States. The US government has embraced it for years and Clearview AI alone has said it counts over 3,100 US agencies among its customers, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and “hundreds of local agencies.”\n\nSurovell hopes more rules will be passed to regulate the technology in other states, similar to how law enforcement use of technologies such as radar, breath testing, and substance analysis are already regulated.\n\n“I think it’s important for the public to have faith in how law enforcement is doing their job, that these technologies be regulated and there be a level of transparency about their use so people can assess for themselves whether it’s accurate and or being abused,” he said.\n\nBut if recent developments are any indication, getting there may be a bumpy ride.\n\nIn New Orleans, an amendment that Harris and two other council members supported that would set guardrails regarding how facial-recognition technology can be used by the city’s police department — such as requiring court approval each time it is used and monthly reports about how it has been used — failed in July. Chris Kaiser, advocacy director for the ACLU of Louisiana, said he was concerned about this, in addition to the change in the city’s rules regarding the use of facial-recognition software in general.\n\n“We can’t understand why you would object to these safeguards,” he said.\n\nThe trio of New Orleans council members tried a second time on Thursday: Their proposed amendment — which was modified in several ways, including removing the need for judicial approval before the use of the technology and requiring quarterly, rather than monthly, reports regarding its use — was voted on once again.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The RNC referred to that day as “legitimate political discourse” in the resolution, but in a rare break with the RNC, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said what occurred was “a violent insurrection.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, defended the RNC’s choice of words. Separately, liberal activists are mounting a legal case to block Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn from running for reelection in North Carolina, arguing he stoked violence by telling the insurrectionists it was “time to fight” days before the attack.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nStates are pulling back on Covid-19 restrictions despite warnings from the CDC that it is too early to do so. There are about 290,000 new coronavirus cases every day, and hospitalization rates are higher than they were at the peak of the Delta surge, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said yesterday, adding it’s too early to lift mask mandates. Despite calls to keep restrictions in place, several states – including California and Delaware – have already announced updated guidance to drop indoor mask mandates in the coming days. And in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lift the state’s strict Covid-19 mitigation requirements for businesses today. That mandate requires businesses to ask customers for proof of vaccination and for them to wear masks indoors, except when eating or drinking.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hospital overwhelmed with onslaught of Covid-19 patients 02:39 - Source: CNN Hospital overwhelmed with onslaught of Covid-19 patients 02:39\n\n3. US Postal Service\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that would overhaul the US Postal Service’s finances and allow the agency to modernize its service after years of crippling losses. The Postal Service Reform Act would require retired postal employees to enroll in Medicare when eligible, while dropping a previous mandate that forced the agency to cover its health care costs years in advance. Those two measures would save the USPS nearly $50 billion over the next decade, according to the House Oversight Committee. The US Postal Service’s “dire financial condition” has kept the agency from modernizing and prevented plans to replace the vast majority of its aging vehicle fleet with electric trucks, according to a USPS spokesperson. The bill, which cleared the House by a 342-92 vote, now heads to the Senate, where it’s expected to be voted on by the end of next week.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback USPS labor shortage may mean Covid tests may not arrive in time 02:45 - Source: CNN USPS labor shortage may mean Covid tests may not arrive in time 02:45\n\n4.

The move comes after a viral TikTok hoax last year warned of forthcoming real-world violence in schools. While the threats were vague, they resulted in school shutdowns across the United States. TikTok also announced a new “dangerous acts and challenges” campaign that will ask creators to make videos asking their followers to follow specific steps when viewing content: stop, think, decide and act.

It had been an exhausting pregnancy. Her family had just moved houses, and Horton was still breastfeeding her toddler. Because of her teenage son’s heart condition, she remained wary of COVID-19 and avoided crowded places, even doctor’s offices. Now, already experiencing the clawing pangs of contractions, she pulled out a frozen pizza and a salad with creamy everything dressing, savoring the hush that fell over the house, the satisfying crunch of the poppy seeds as she ate.\n\nHorton didn’t realize that she would be drug tested before her child’s birth. Or that the poppy seeds in her salad could trigger a positive result on a urine drug screen, the quick test that hospitals often use to check pregnant patients for illicit drugs. Many common foods and medications — from antacids to blood pressure and cold medicines — can prompt erroneous results.\n\nThe morning after Horton delivered her daughter, a nurse told her she had tested positive for opiates. Horton was shocked. She hadn’t requested an epidural or any narcotic pain medication during labor — she didn’t even like taking Advil. “You’re sure it was mine?” she asked the nurse.\n\nIf Horton had been tested under different circumstances — for example, if she was a government employee and required to be tested as part of her job — she would have been entitled to a more advanced test and to a review from a specially trained doctor to confirm the initial result.\n\nBut as a mother giving birth, Horton had no such protections. The hospital quickly reported her to child welfare, and the next day, a social worker arrived to take baby Halle into protective custody.\n\nIowa couple's story: Hospital policy prompted a surprise drug test that nearly cost this couple their 2 sons\n\nKaiser Permanente declined to comment on Horton’s care. In a statement, it said the Santa Rosa hospital typically gets consent to drug-test patients for medical reasons, and as a mandated reporter under state law, it refers potential exposures of newborns to illicit drugs to child welfare authorities.\n\nThe Sonoma County Human Services Department said, in a statement, that it evaluates all referrals using “evidence- and research-based” methods, and if a report is deemed valid, it has a duty under state law to investigate.\n\nHorton said the experience made her feel powerless and terrified.\n\n“They had a singular piece of evidence that I had taken something,” she said, “and it was wrong.”\n\nFor decades, state and federal laws have required hospitals across the country to identify newborns affected by drugs in the womb and to refer such cases to child protective services for possible investigation. To comply, hospitals often use urine drug screens that are inexpensive (as little as $10 per test), simple to administer (the patient pees in a cup), and provide results within minutes.\n\nBut urine drug screens are easily misinterpreted and often wrong, with false positive rates as high as 50%, according to some studies. Without confirmation testing and additional review, false positive results can lead hospitals to wrongly accuse parents of illicit drug use and report babies to child welfare agencies — which may separate newborns from their families, an investigation by The Marshall Project and Reveal has found.\n\nRead people-first stories about health: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter.\n\nIt’s unclear how many of the nation’s 3.6 million births every year involve drug testing, but health care experts said urine screening is ubiquitous. Tens of thousands of infants are reported annually to authorities for in utero drug exposure, with no guarantee that the underlying tests are accurate, our analysis of federal data shows.\n\nTo report this story, The Marshall Project interviewed dozens of patients, medical providers, toxicologists and other experts, and collected information on more than 50 mothers in 22 states who faced reports and investigations over positive drug tests that were likely wrong. We also pored over thousands of pages of policy documents from every state child welfare agency in the country.\n\nProblems with drug screens are well known, especially in workplace testing. But there’s been little investigation of how easily false positives can occur inside labor and delivery units, and how quickly families can get trapped inside a system of surveillance and punishment.\n\nHospitals reported women for positive drug tests after they ate everything bagels and lemon poppy seed muffins, or used medications including the acid reducer Zantac, the antidepressant Zoloft and labetalol, one of the most commonly prescribed blood pressure treatments for pregnant women.\n\nAfter a California mother had a false positive for meth and PCP, authorities took her newborn, then dispatched two sheriff’s deputies to also remove her toddler from her custody, court records show. In New York, hospital administrators refused to retract a child welfare report based on a false positive result, and instead offered the mother counseling for her trauma, according to a recording of the conversation. And when a Pennsylvania woman tested positive for opioids after eating pasta salad, the hearing officer in her case yelled at her to “buck up, get a backbone, and stop crying,” court records show. It took three months to get her newborn back from foster care.\n\nFederal officials have known for decades that urine screens are not reliable. Poppy seeds — which come from the same plant used to make heroin — are so notorious for causing positives for opiates that last year the Department of Defense directed service members to stop eating them. At hospitals, test results often come with warnings about false positives and direct clinicians to confirm the findings with more definitive tests.\n\nYet state policies and many hospitals tend to treat drug screens as unassailable evidence of illicit use, The Marshall Project found. Hospitals across the country routinely report cases to authorities without ordering confirmation tests or waiting to receive the results.\n\nAt least 27 states explicitly require hospitals to alert child welfare agencies after a positive screen or potential exposure, according to a review of state laws and policies by The Marshall Project. But not a single state requires hospitals to confirm test results before reporting them. At least 25 states do not require child welfare workers to confirm positive test results, either.\n\nWhile parents often lack protections, most of the caseworkers who investigate them are entitled to confirmation testing and a review if they test positive for drugs on the job, our analysis found.\n\nHealth care providers say there are medical reasons to test labor and delivery patients for drugs, including alerting doctors to watch a newborn for withdrawal symptoms. They also cite concerns about criminal and legal liability if they fail to report positive test results.\n\nEven when a doctor refutes a positive result and vouches for their patient, hospitals may report the incorrect data anyway to child welfare agencies.\n\n“It’s almost like a gut punch. You come to the hospital and you see a social work note on your patient’s chart,” said Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB/GYN in Huntsville, Alabama, who has tried and failed several times to halt child welfare reports and investigations of patients with false positive results. “Once that ball is rolling, it’s hard to stop it,” Robinson said.\n\nNo government agency collects comprehensive data on false positive results or on how many pregnant patients are tested. And confidentiality laws that shield medical and child welfare records make it difficult for the public to understand how many families are affected.\n\nIn 2016, Congress mandated states to submit the number of “substance-affected” infants to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Not all states track every case, but from fiscal years 2018 through 2022, medical professionals reported at least 170,000 infants to child welfare agencies for exposure to substances, according to an analysis by The Marshall Project. In 2022 alone, more than 35,000 such cases were reported, and authorities removed more than 6,000 infants from their families, our analysis found.\n\nThe harms of drug testing fall disproportionately on low-income, Black, Hispanic and Native American women, who studies have found are more likely to be tested when they give birth, more likely to be investigated, and less likely to reunite with their children after they’ve been removed.\n\nBut the false-positive cases The Marshall Project identified include parents of all socioeconomic classes and occupations — from a lawyer to a school librarian to a nurse who drug tests other people for a living.\n\n“People should be concerned,” said Dr. Stephen Patrick, a leading neonatal researcher who chairs the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. “This could happen to any one of us.”\n\n***\n\nDrug screens are more guesswork than exact science. Chemicals in the tests quickly cross-react with urine, flagging anything that looks like it could be an illicit substance. The tests are like fishing nets that are cast wide and pick up anything and everything that fits, said Dr. Gwen McMillin, a professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine and medical director of a drug-testing lab. The problem is that nets also ensnare fish that aren’t being targeted: compounds that are closely related to illicit substances or merely look similar.\n\n“Drug testing results need to be confirmed before they go to CPS,” McMillin said. “Actions should not be taken based on a single drug testing result. Period.”\n\nBut sometimes, even confirmation tests can be misinterpreted, as Susan Horton found.\n\nAt first, Horton was puzzled by her positive test result. She wondered if her urine might have been mixed up with another patient’s. Then — “ding ding ding!” — her last meal popped into her head. She told a nurse about the poppy seeds in her salad, sure that this would resolve her doctors’ concerns.\n\nHorton’s records show Kaiser ran her urine sample through a second test, and this time it came back positive for one opiate in particular: codeine. That shouldn’t have been surprising — poppy seeds, like the ones in Horton’s salad, are derived from the opium poppy plant and contain codeine.\n\nTo differentiate between salad dressing or bagels and illicit drugs, toxicologists have long recommended testing urine for the presence of a compound called thebaine, which is found in poppy seeds, but not in heroin. There’s no indication that the hospital performed or even knew about the thebaine test, leaving providers with no way to prove or disprove Horton’s claims.\n\n“Mom and dad insistent that a Costco salad with poppyseed dressing is responsible,” a doctor wrote in her notes. Another doctor wrote: “We are unable to verify whether this could result in a positive test.”\n\nSoon, multiple doctors and nurses filed into Horton’s room. They said hospital policy dictated that Halle remain there for five days to be monitored for possible drug withdrawal symptoms — “for baby’s safety,” a doctor told Horton.\n\nUnlike most other states that require hospitals to report positive drug tests, California law says a positive test alone “is not in and of itself a sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or neglect.” But because of COVID-19 and her son’s heart condition, Horton had also missed some prenatal appointments, which many providers see as a red flag for drug use. A hospital social worker noted the missed appointments and decided to file a report.\n\nIn a statement about its practices in general, Kaiser said it always conducts a “multi-faceted assessment” prior to filing a report to CPS, which is responsible for reviewing the information and investigating.\n\nHorton insisted that keeping her baby at the hospital was unnecessary. “I’m not a drug addict,” she said she pleaded. Desperate for help, her husband called the police, who declined to oppose hospital directives, records show.\n\nWhen the caseworker arrived, the couple refused to sign a safety plan or allow the person to interview their children and inspect their home. So the caseworker immediately obtained a judge’s order and placed baby Halle into temporary custody in the hospital, before discharging her to her grandparents, who were ordered to supervise Horton with her child.\n\nA few days later, Horton stood silently in court, dressed in pants that clung uncomfortably to her still-healing body, feeling as if her motherhood was on trial. A caseworker told the judge it would be dangerous to release Halle to her parents, and Horton agreed to another drug test. A worker followed her to the bathroom and watched her urinate in a cup.\n\nBy then, caseworkers and doctors had privately acknowledged that poppy seeds could have caused Horton’s positive test result. But in court the caseworker didn’t mention that. Instead, she argued that Horton’s purported drug use had “caused serious physical harm” to her child.\n\nThe agency said under state law it can’t comment on individual cases. Speaking generally, it said a single positive drug test, false or otherwise, doesn’t warrant an investigation, and that there needs to be “a reported observation of impact to the child.”\n\n***\n\nWhen workplace drug testing was introduced in the 1980s, unions and civil rights groups decried the error rates of drug screens and how companies were firing workers over false positive results. In response, federal authorities mandated safeguards for employees, including requiring confirmation tests and a review from a specially trained doctor to determine whether a food or medication could have caused a positive result.\n\nA federal medical advisory committee in 1993 urged health care providers who drug test pregnant patients to adopt the same rigorous standards. But amid the “crack baby” panic, the idea of protecting mothers did not catch on.\n\nHospital drug testing policies vary widely. Many facilities, such as Kaiser in Santa Rosa, test every single labor-and-delivery patient. Other hospitals flag only certain people, such as those with limited prenatal care, high blood pressure, even bad teeth, experts say. At many hospitals, the decision is up to doctors and nurses, who may view a mother’s tattoos, disheveled clothing or stressed demeanor with suspicion. Studies have found that the decision to test is rife with class and race bias.\n\n“Those who look like they have less resources, people might say, ‘Well, they look more likely to use drugs,’” said Dr. Cresta Jones, an associate professor and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of Minnesota Medical School.\n\nHospitals often have full discretion over whether or not to screen for drugs, but once a positive result is in hand, the decision to report becomes more complicated. Laws and policies in at least 12 states explicitly require hospitals to send screen results to child welfare agencies, even if they are not confirmed, according to The Marshall Project’s review.\n\nFor hospitals, cost is also an issue. While urine screens are cheap, the equipment needed to run a confirmation test costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, in addition to the cost of expert personnel and lab certification. Some hospitals contract out confirmation testing — a lower-cost alternative — but getting results can take days, long after many families are ready to go home.\n\nDoctors, nurses and hospital social workers face an uncomfortable predicament: Do they send the baby home to what they believe could be an unsafe environment, or do they call authorities?\n\n“God forbid the baby goes home, withdraws and dies, we’re going to be held liable for that,” said Dr. Adi Davidov, an obstetrician at Staten Island University Hospital, which drug tests every birthing patient.\n\nState mandatory reporting laws add to the pressure on doctors and nurses. These laws impose criminal liability on providers who fail to report, while also protecting physicians who report “in good faith” — insulating hospitals from lawsuits if test results are wrong.\n\nEven when doctors have the ability to order a confirmation test, they don’t always do so. Many misinterpret positive screens as definitive evidence of drug use.\n\nWhen Grace Smith had her fourth child in 2021 at St. Luke’s University Hospital, an hour north of Philadelphia, she was taking prescribed marijuana and Vyvanse, a medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The medicine contains amphetamine, but the hospital’s drug screen results did not differentiate between meth and amphetamine, according to medical records. The day after Smith delivered her son, a doctor told her that she and her baby had tested positive for meth and that the hospital had notified child protective services.\n\nSmith’s husband Michael asked the doctor to review his wife’s medical records to confirm her prescription, according to the doctor’s notes. The doctor argued that wasn’t her role. “I explained that our responsibility as healthcare workers was to report the case” to child welfare authorities, she wrote, adding that the agency “would conduct any investigation that was necessary.”\n\nWhen Michael Smith told the doctor they were leaving with their baby, the hospital called the police. An officer escorted the parents out, without their newborn, a police report shows. The Smiths said the police told them they would be arrested if they returned.\n\nSt. Luke’s University Health Network declined to answer questions from The Marshall Project, saying in an email that the hospital “complies with all rules and regulations regarding drug testing and reporting” and that the newborn’s welfare “is always our primary concern.”\n\nFour days after the Smiths’ son was born, Monroe County Children and Youth Services told the hospital it was OK to release the baby to his parents. But the investigation remained open. It wasn’t until the Smiths paid more than $3,500 for a lawyer — and nearly $300 for a confirmation drug test that came back negative — that the agency closed their case. The agency declined to comment.\n\nThe Smiths filed a lawsuit in 2022 against St. Luke’s. In its response, the hospital acknowledged that it had not given Grace a confirmation test, but denied violating the Smiths’ privacy or civil rights. A judge dismissed the suit in 2023, saying in part that the Smiths did not sufficiently argue their claims.\n\nMany providers erroneously assume that child welfare agencies verify a parent’s drug use. But government caseworkers typically lack the expertise to accurately interpret drug test results. State policy manuals seldom mention the possibility of false positives. It often falls on parents to prove their own innocence.\n\nAs a nurse in South Carolina, Ashley Riley said she regularly drug-tested patients in an addiction treatment program, flagged faulty tests, and sent out positive screens for confirmation. But when she herself screened positive for opiates after delivering her son in 2023, Riley said the hospital declined to order a confirmation test, then reported her to authorities.\n\nRiley and her husband, Jeffrey, insisted the positive result was from lemon poppy seed muffins that she had eaten throughout her pregnancy. As proof, Jeffrey Riley texted the investigator a receipt for the muffins, studies on false positives caused by poppy seeds, and the 2023 memo from the Department of Defense urging service members to avoid poppy seeds.\n\n“At no point in time was there anybody in there that was even trying to advocate for my wife, except for me,” he recalled.\n\nAt first, he thought his efforts were working. The caseworker acknowledged in his notes having seen the poppy seeds and noted that the report “could be falsified.”\n\nBut the caseworker still insisted the couple sign a safety plan, advising them that their two children would be placed in foster care unless they assigned a “protector” — a responsible adult who would supervise them with their children at all times. This continued for 45 days before the case was closed as unfounded.\n\n“We were guilty until proven innocent,” Ashley Riley said.\n\nThe hospital even charged $424 for the problematic urine test. Hospital officials did not respond to multiple interview requests.\n\nWill Batchelor, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Social Services, wrote in a statement that the agency has a duty to investigate once a hospital has filed a report, and that it “exercised appropriate restraint” by not removing the child from the home.\n\n“Because the safety of a child is at stake, DSS has to continue its investigation beyond seeing a receipt for poppy seed muffins,” Batchelor wrote.\n\nEven when a parent has a confirmation test and her own doctor’s word attesting to a false positive result, authorities may keep investigating.\n\nWhen Melissa Robinson, an elementary school librarian in Huntsville, Alabama, screened pos​​itive for cocaine in early 2024, the news shocked her and her doctors. Robinson had avoided anything during her pregnancy that could be risky, even cold cuts — which may carry bacteria — and had no history of drug use. Because of the positive test, staff told Robinson she was not allowed to breastfeed her daughter, hospital records show, and they reported her to Alabama’s child welfare agency, the Department of Human Resources. Robinson said a caseworker told her that she probably wouldn’t be allowed to be alone with her baby — her husband would have to supervise.\n\nA few days later, a confirmation test came back negative for any substances. With proof that she had not used cocaine, Robinson assumed the case would be closed. Instead, the agency continued to investigate, inspecting her home and even requiring her husband to take a drug test, she said.\n\nAlabama’s child welfare agency said they are required to respond immediately to a hospital report and “make safety decisions relying on current and most accessible information.”\n\nWhen the baby was two weeks old, the agency closed the case, citing insufficient evidence. But the allegations will remain on Robinson’s record for at least five years.\n\n“To have such a beautiful experience tainted by something like that, it’s difficult,” Robinson recalled. “Truthfully, it’s turned me into somebody different.”\n\n***\n\nSome medical groups and providers have taken steps to reduce unnecessary child welfare reports. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises hospitals to use a screening questionnaire rather than drug tests to identify people who may have substance abuse problems. The organization also recommends that hospitals obtain consent from patients, explaining the potential consequences of a positive result — including if the hospital is required to report it to authorities. A number of large hospitals have adopted some version of those recommendations.\n\nAfter a study at Staten Island University Hospital in New York found a high rate of false positives, administrators brought the confirmation testing in-house. They said results come back within a day or two, rather than the week that is typical for outside tests, which allows providers to wait before contacting child welfare.\n\n“Any time you act on a test that’s not 100%, you run the risk of causing more harm than good,” said the hospital’s Dr. Davidov. “If you are going to get CPS involved with a mother who did nothing wrong, is a good citizen, that’s harming her. It’s harming her experience, it’s harming her ability to take care of her newborn.”\n\nIn recent years, advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against hospitals for testing without explicit consent, which has led some state officials and lawmakers to speak out against the testing. But in most of the U.S., it remains common practice to report families based on unconfirmed positive screens. Most of the women interviewed by The Marshall Project signed general consent forms at the hospital, but said they were never informed explicitly they would be drug tested, nor that a positive result could be reported to authorities.\n\nFor Susan Horton, her family’s ordeal has created an undercurrent of fear that courses through her daily life.\n\nAfter the court hearing in August 2022, child welfare workers took the baby to Horton’s elderly in-laws and barred Horton and her husband from being alone with their newborn while the agency investigated. Finally, almost two weeks after their daughter was born, the agency withdrew its petition and a judge dismissed the case, allowing the Hortons to bring baby Halle home.\n\nOne afternoon last spring, Horton took her daughter, now a toddler, outside. Halle giggled as her mother chased her around the front yard, her little feet splashing in a small mud hole. This was the life Horton had envisioned years ago — a quiet place in the California countryside where her children could delight in the world around them. And yet, Horton couldn’t help but remember the investigation that destroyed her family’s peace of mind — and her self-esteem.\n\n“I had a lot of confidence in how I mother and how I parent,” she said, adding later: ”Now in my head, I’m always questioning my choices.” She wondered aloud what neighbors would say if they saw her daughter playing in the mud, if someone might accuse her of being a bad parent.\n\n“I just always have that looming feeling that at any moment CPS could come knocking and take my children away.”\n\nThe Marshall Project reporters Weihua Li, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Nakylah Carter and Catherine Odom contributed to this story.\n\nThis article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system, Reveal and Mother Jones.

The reaction's been a ...", "text": "The internet, once again, can't seem to stop talking about conjoined twins Brittany and Abigail Hensel − and experts say the unwelcome obsession over their personal lives has gone too far.\n\nThe 34-year-old twins, who rose to fame in several television shows including \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 1996 and the series \"Abby & Brittany\" in 2012, were recently thrust back into the spotlight as multiple outlets, including Today and the New York Post, reported Abigail had a private wedding ceremony in 2021.\n\nThe Hensels have said little about the nuptials themselves, but they seemed to confirm the ceremony on their unverified TikTok account where they shared what appears to be wedding photos in 2023. The twins haven't commented directly on the ensuing discourse, but they did share two TikTok videos late last month that seemed to reference it. In one of the videos, they wrote in the caption, \"The internet is extra LOUD today. We have always been around,\" and, in another, they included an audio addressing \"all the haters out there.\"\n\nExperts in disability and media studies say heightened fascination around the Hensel twins' personal lives illuminates a lot about how people treat and talk about those with unusual bodies. The truth is, the Hensel twins, like anyone else, deserve to live a normal life and not spark discussion whenever they do so.\n\n\"We see something where this is unusual, this is exciting, this is a little out of the ordinary, and it's not something that many people are equipped to talk about very well,\" says Elizabeth Ellcessor, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of the book \"Restricted Access: Media, Disability, and the Politics of Participation.\" \"And so we see a lot of social media attention and other coverage that is focusing on this as being particularly remarkable, when people in their thirties get married all the time.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhy are people so fascinated by Abby Hensel's wedding?\n\nOn the one hand, fascination around the Hensel twins is to be expected, says Alice Dreger, a historian, bioethicist and the author of \"One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal.\" After all, conjoined twins are rare, and people are often fascinated by the lives of people in unusual circumstances.\n\n\"People have always been fascinated by conjoined twins because they obviously represent a challenge to the way we think about individuality,\" Dreger says. \"We normally think of individuality as being about one person existing in one expansive skin, and, for conjoined twins like Abigail and Brittany, they are are obviously two people in one expansive skin.\"\n\nThis fascination, however, becomes problematic when it gives way to exploitation and the violation of others' privacy. The Hensel twins, for instance, have kept a relatively low public profile outside their television appearances, giving the impression they aren't interested in sharing every detail of their lives with the world.\n\nFascination around the Hensel twins' romantic relationships is also especially inappropriate, because it often stems from \"prurient sexual interest,\" Ellcessor says. This is likely why the Hensels seem to have no desire to address any of the reactions to Abigail's wedding.\n\n\"They have no interest in answering follow-up questions,\" Ellcessor adds. \"This is not anyone else's business.\"\n\nFor disability community, dating comes with unique challenges\n\nHow should we talk about Abby and Brittany Hensel?\n\nEllcessor says it's essential for any discussion about the Hensels' private lives to happen on their terms, not anyone else's, and to let the twins take the lead on what's OK for speculation and what's not.\n\n\"The best advice is to prioritize their voices and their wishes,\" she says. \"What do they want to share? What do they want us to know?\"\n\nIt's also important to remember to treat people with unusual bodies as human beings rather than as anomalies.\n\nSpeed dating is making a comeback as Gen Z ditches dating apps. We shouldn't be surprised.\n\nAnd, if they choose to not open their lives to discussion, it's important to respect that.\n\n\"The experience of having a body that's different depends on the culture that's around you,\" Dreger says. \"Abigail and Brittany have been fortunate to live in a small town that has been reasonable and accepting. And, in fact, throughout history, most conjoined twins have chosen to live in small towns for I think exactly this reason: that they can live peaceful lives without constant interference.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}]}

Study highlights a West Coast risk.", "text": "The pressure keeps building below the Earth’s surface off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and a multi-layered disaster could strike at any time.\n\nA huge earthquake is brewing along the Cascadia Subduction Zone that could destroy bridges, reshape the landscape and trigger a massive tsunami. Scientists have known about the looming danger for years, but ongoing research keeps painting a clearer picture of what could happen.\n\nAmong the dangers: A huge tsunami that will wash over coastal areas and permanently flood them.\n\nThe quake is a matter of when, not if, said Tina Dura, a geologist and professor of natural hazards at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\n\"Geologically speaking, we’re well within the window of possibility,\" she said.\n\nDura was the lead author on a new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on how climate change is increasing the potential impact of such an earthquake on coastal areas that may suddenly sink.\n\nResearchers expect the quake will trigger an as much a 6-foot drop in some inland areas — then a massive tsunami will flood those regions, some permanently.\n\n\"Imagine if, after Hurricane Katrina, after all the horrible things that happened, if we'd also lost big chunks of New Orleans and it never came back,\" said Diego Melgar, a professor at the University of Oregon and director of the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center.\n\nThe loss of swaths of land is just one of the surreal series of events that will occur when the earthquake eventually strikes, researchers say.\n\nWhen will the next big Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake strike?\n\nThis is a mix of bad and good news. The quake is a certainty, but could be hundreds of years off.\n\nWhile it could happen at any time, seismologists have estimated there is a 15% probability of a magnitude 8 in the next 50 years — a substantial risk for such a devastating scenario.\n\n\"We can’t predict exactly when the next great Cascadia earthquake will occur. It could be tomorrow or decades from now,\" said Dura.\n\nPart of their confidence comes from the history of huge earthquakes in the region.\n\n\"The last event was in 1700, and paleoseismic records show these earthquakes recur roughly every 200 to 800 years. By 2100, there is a 30% chance of a large earthquake happening,\" Dura said.\n\nThe Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake\n\nScientists have a clear picture of what will happen when the earthquake strikes.\n\n“First would come extremely strong shaking – shaking that makes it difficult to stand or walk. This would probably last a minute or longer,\" said Melgar.\n\nNext, land along the coast would drop as much as six-and-a-half feet in places, probably within minutes.\n\n\"Then there would probably be 30 to 40 minutes of seeming peace. But that's a false impression, because the tsunami is coming,\" he said.\n\nThe resulting waves would be on the order of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed nearly 230,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami wave from an earthquake of this size could get to 90 or 100 feet tall, Melgar said.\n\nTsunami trouble\n\nWhen the tsunami wave arrives at the shore \"you get this massive surge that lasts for hours, sometimes days,\" Melgar said.\n\nThis is where global warming comes in. Two things play a part in creating the catastrophe their research describes.\n\nFirst, the land would have dropped as much as six feet. At the same time, sea level rise from climate change means that the water which rushes in will cover more land.\n\n\"You'd hope the tsunami could come to shore, then flow out again and the land would dry out. But there will be parts where it's now below sea level – the water won't flow back,\" said Melgar.\n\nA great Cascadia earthquake could instantly expand flood zones and double flood exposure for residents, structures, and roads. When combined with rising sea levels, these effects could render some coastal communities permanently uninhabitable, said Dura.\n\nEven if some areas along the coastline do dry out, they will be much closer to sea level and become susceptible to nuisance flooding if there's a particularly big storm or high tide.\n\nLittle earthquakes won't prevent a big one\n\nThe West Coast is subject to numerous small earthquakes all the time, but they're not big enough to relieve the pressure that's being built up along the Cascadia fault line, Melgar said.\n\nSo much energy has built up in the zone that even a magnitude 8 earthquake wouldn't relieve it.\n\n\"Remember, the magnitude scale is logarithmic. So each increase in magnitude is an increase of 30 in terms of energy,\" he said.\n\nThe great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was a magnitude 8 temblor and it was devastating. \"If we had one magnitude 8 quake here, we'd still have 29 to go to relieve the pressure,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/30/strongest-earthquakes-ever-in-the-world/85434059007/", "title": "Russian quake is among the top 10 in history: See where it ranks", "text": "A magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29 is now among the 10 largest ever recorded on the planet.\n\nWith a depth of about 12 miles, the shallow quake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET approximately 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

The quake was felt across much of South America.\n\nMore than 800,000 people were displaced from their homes. The economic loss was estimated at $30 billion. The tsunami even reached San Diego, California, where it damaged boats docked there.\n\nQuake near Kamchatka, Russia: Nov. 4, 1952\n\nA 9.0 quake off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, triggered a tsunami that caused serious damage and killed at least 4,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami made its way through the Pacific Ocean, causing up to $1 million of damage in Hawaii, where the waves destroyed boats and piers and killed six cows.\n\nJapan earthquake and tsunami: March 11, 2011\n\nThe Great Tohoku Earthquake struck Japan on March 11, 2011, with a magnitude of 9.1 which also triggered a catastrophic tsunami that hit within 30 minutes of the quake. The tsunami disabled three nuclear reactors, causing a nuclear disaster. Hundreds of fires also broke out as a result.\n\nMore than 18,000 people died, including thousands never found but presumed dead, and over 6,000 were injured. More than 100,000 homes were totally destroyed and almost a million more were damaged, mostly due to the tsunami. Damage was recorded from the tsunami around the world, including in Hawaii, California, Peru, and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nSumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake: Dec. 26, 2004\n\nA 9.1-magnitude earthquake and tsunami off the west coast of northern Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, killed more than 283,000 people and displaced over 1 million more across 10 countries in Asia and Africa.\n\n\"The tsunami caused more casualties than any other in recorded history and was recorded nearly world-wide on tide gauges in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,\" the U.S. Geological Survey site said.\n\nGreat Alaska Earthquake: March 27, 1964\n\nAlso known as the Good Friday Earthquake, a 9.2 quake in southern Alaska and tsunami killed 131 people and caused over $2 billion in damage across the cities of Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer, Hope and many others in Alaska. A J.C. Penney building sustained heavy damage and an apartment building collapsed in Anchorage, while the school system was devastated.\n\nValdivian Earthquake: May 22, 1960\n\nThe Valdivian Earthquake, or the Great Chilean Earthquake, is the largest on record.

No federal agency currently samples Pacific Coast seawater for radiation, he said.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be alarmist,\" Buesseler said. \"We can make predictions, we can do models. But unless you have results, how will we know it's safe?\"\n\nThe news comes three years after the devastating Japan tsunami and resulting nuclear accident.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit off the coast of Japan, triggering a tsunami with waves as high as 133 feet. More than 15,000 people died and about 6,000 were injured.\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami knocked out power to cooling pumps at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant complex, causing meltdowns at three reactors.\n\nLast July, Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the plant, acknowledged for the first time that the reactor was leaking contaminated underground water into the ocean.\n\nSince then, the news has gotten worse, and there is widespread suspicion that the problem is underreported.\n\nThere are three competing models of the Fukushima radiation plume, differing in amount and timing. But all predict that the plume will reach the West Coast this summer, and the most commonly cited one estimates an April arrival, Buesseler said.\n\nA report presented last week at a conference of the American Geophysical Union's Ocean Sciences Section showed that some Cesium 134 has already has arrived in Canada, in the Gulf of Alaska area.\n\nCesium 134 serves as a fingerprint for Fukushima, Buesseler said.\n\n\"The models show it will reach north of Seattle first, then move down the coast,\" Buesseler said.\n\nBy the time it gets here, the material will be so diluted as to be almost negligible, the models predict. Radiation also decays. Cesium 134, for example, has a half-life of two years, meaning it will have half its original intensity after that period.\n\nIn Oregon, state park rangers take quarterly samples of surf water and sand at three locations along the coast. The water is analyzed for Cesium 137 and iodine 131. Both of those already exist in the ocean at low levels from nuclear testing decades ago.\n\nThe monitoring began in April 2012, when tsunami debris began arriving along the Oregon coast. So far, all of the tests have shown less than \"minimum detectable activity,\" or the least amount that can be measured.\n\nResults of the most recent samples, taken in mid-February, won't be available until mid-March, Oregon Health Authority spokesman Jonathan Modie said.\n\nWashington does not test ocean water for radiation.\n\n\"We have none happening now and we have none planned,\" said Tim Church, communications director for the Washington State Department of Health. \"Typically that would be something that would happen on the federal level.\"\n\nCalifornia regularly samples seawater around the state's nuclear power plants to determine whether the plants are impacting the environment. Those results all are below minimum detectable activity.\n\nSome citizens and scientists are taking sampling into their own hands.\n\nCal State Long Beach marine biologist Steven Manley has launched \"Kelp Watch 2014,\" which will partner with other organizations to monitor kelp all along the West Coast for Fukushima radiation.\n\nAnd Buesseler recently offered the services of his lab at Woods Hole in Massachusetts.\n\nHis project — titled \"How Radioactive Is Our Ocean?\" — will use crowd-sourced money and volunteers to collect water samples along the Pacific Coast, then ship them across the country to be analyzed.\n\nSo far, results are in for two locations in Washington and three in California. They show that the plume has not yet reached the coast.\n\nMeanwhile, West Coast states are winding down their tsunami debris response efforts.\n\nOregon's coastline is seeing less debris from the tsunami this winter than in the past two years, Oregon State Parks spokesman Chris Havel said.\n\nIf that doesn't change, officials likely will disband a task force that was mobilized to deal with the debris.\n\nLast year, Washington suspended its marine debris reporting hotline.\n\nLoew also reports for the (Salem, Ore.)

Several published studies also indicate that a Cascadia Subduction Zone tsunami can cause severe damage and inland flooding.\n\nIn 2011, the earthquake in Japan spurred waves of more than 8 feet, destroying Crescent City's harbor.\n\n\"The water went out to a low tide, but each wave was coming back in and it was getting higher and higher,\" Max Blair, 79, a volunteer at the Del Norte Historical Society located near downtown Crescent City, recalled to USA TODAY on July 30. \"The harbor was a whole different story.\"\n\nOne man died during the incident as the harbor docks were smashed and dozens of boats sank, causing an estimated $50 million in damage. The harbor was eventually rebuilt as the first \"tsunami resistant port\" on the West Coast.\n\nAnother deadly tsunami struck Crescent City in 1964, triggered by a massive earthquake in Alaska, killing 11 people and injuring 35 others. The tsunami destroyed nearly 300 buildings and homes, causing between $11 million and $16 million in damages. The incident is considered one of the most devastating tsunamis in U.S. history.\n\n\"I've heard and read about it,\" said Blair who's lived in Crescent City for more than 30 years. \"I hope we never get to experience anything like that one.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/07/30/deadliest-tsunami-history-list-compare/85438549007/", "title": "What are the 10 deadliest tsunamis in history?

Indian Ocean quake off coast of Sumatra: April 11, 2012\n\nAn 8.6 quake off the coast of Sumatra on April 11, 2012, was one of two quakes in the Indian Ocean that struck near Indonesia, felt across the islands of Sumatra and Java, and widely felt in parts of South and Southeast Asia\n\nThe first quake registered at a magnitude of 8.6 at about 3:38 p.m. local time. It killed two people and at least eight died from heart attacks attributed to the quake. A dozen more were injured in the Indonesian province Aceh. Just over two hours later, another quake of 8.2 magnitude was felt in the same region and even triggered a local tsunami.\n\n9. Assam-Tibet earthquake: Aug. 15, 1950\n\nAn Aug. 15, 1950, earthquake caused destruction in India and Tibet with a magnitude of 8.6, recalculated from an earlier designation of 8.7. More than 1,500 people were killed, including hundreds who died days after the quake when a dam broke. The quake triggered landslides that wiped out whole villages.\n\n8. Rat Islands earthquake: Feb. 4, 1965\n\nAn 8.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Rat Islands, a group of Alaskan islands within the Aleutian Islands, on Feb. 4, 1965, also triggering a tsunami. Damage was reported to structures from the impact of the earthquake and subsequent flooding, but no deaths were reported.\n\n7. Ecuador-Colombia quake: Jan. 31, 1906\n\nNear the coast of Ecuador on Jan. 31, 1906, an 8.8 quake caused a tsunami that killed between 500 and 1,500 people in Ecuador and Colombia. Its magnitude has been recalculated after being originally estimated at 8.2. The tsunami reached Hilo, Hawaii, over 5,000 miles away 12.5 hours later.\n\n6. Chilean earthquake: Feb. 27, 2010\n\nMore than 500 people were killed and over two dozen were declared missing, another 12,000 were injured and hundreds of thousands of structures were damaged or destroyed in an 8.8 earthquake and tsunami near Quirihue, Chile on Feb. 27, 2010. The quake was felt across much of South America.\n\nMore than 800,000 people were displaced from their homes. The economic loss was estimated at $30 billion. The tsunami even reached San Diego, California, where it damaged boats docked there.\n\n5. Quake near Kamchatka, Russia: Nov. 4, 1952\n\nA 9.0 quake off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, triggered a tsunami that caused serious damage and killed at least 4,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami made its way through the Pacific Ocean, causing up to $1 million of damage in Hawaii, where the waves destroyed boats and piers and killed six cows.\n\n4. Japan earthquake and tsunami: March 11, 2011\n\nThe Great Tohoku Earthquake struck Japan on March 11, 2011, with a magnitude of 9.1 that also triggered a catastrophic tsunami that hit within 30 minutes of the quake. The tsunami disabled three nuclear reactors, causing a nuclear disaster. Hundreds of fires also broke out as a result.\n\nMore than 18,000 people died, including thousands never found but presumed dead, and over 6,000 were injured. More than 100,000 homes were totally destroyed and almost a million more were damaged, mostly due to the tsunami. Damage was recorded from the tsunami around the world, including in Hawaii, California, Peru, and the Galapagos Islands.\n\n3. Sumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake: Dec. 26, 2004\n\nA 9.1-magnitude earthquake and tsunami off the west coast of northern Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, killed more than 283,000 people and displaced over 1 million more across 10 countries in Asia and Africa.\n\n\"The tsunami caused more casualties than any other in recorded history and was recorded nearly world-wide on tide gauges in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,\" the U.S. Geological Survey site said.\n\n2. Great Alaska Earthquake: March 27, 1964\n\nAlso known as the Good Friday Earthquake, a 9.2 quake in southern Alaska and tsunami killed 131 people and caused over $2 billion in damage across the cities of Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer, Hope and many others in Alaska. A J.C. Penney building sustained heavy damage and an apartment building collapsed in Anchorage, while the school system was devastated.\n\n1. Valdivian Earthquake: May 22, 1960\n\nThe Valdivian Earthquake, or the Great Chilean Earthquake, is the largest on record. It measured in at a magnitude of 9.5. off the coast of Chile near Valdivia and Puerto Montt area.\n\nAt least 1,655 people were killed and 3,000 were injured in southern Chile; 61 died in Hawaii; 138 in Japan and 32 in the Philippines.

France, with its controlling traditions, appears to be out front in pushing an outright ban.\n\nFrench legislators stopped short of approving a measure banning anyone under 16 from modeling products meant for grown-ups — a sensitive subject in a country renowned for its fashion and cosmetics industries, and about to host Paris Fashion Week.\n\nThe proposed children's pageant amendment sprouted from a debate on a women's rights law. The legislation, approved by a vote of 197-146, must go to the lower house of parliament for further debate and another vote.\n\nIts language is brief but sweeping: \"Organizing beauty competitions for children under 16 is banned.\" Violators — who could include parents, or contest organizers, or anyone who \"encourages or tolerates children's access to these competitions\" — would face up to two years in prison and $40,000 in fines.\n\nIt doesn't specify whether it would extend to things like online photo competitions or pretty baby contests.\n\nWhile child beauty pageants are not as common in France as in the U.S., girls get the message early on here that they are sexual beings, from advertising and marketing campaigns — and even from department stores that sell lingerie for girls as young as 6.\n\nThe U.S. has also seen controversy around child beauty pageants and reality shows like \"Toddlers & Tiaras.\" Such contests gripped the public imagination after the 1996 death of 6-year-old beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, as images of her splashed over national television and opened the eyes of many to the scope of the industry.\n\n\"We are talking about children who are only being judged on their appearance, and that is totally contrary to the development of a child,\" the French amendment's author, Chantal Jouanno, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The question of the hyper-sexualization is deeper in the United States than in France, but the levees are starting to fall. Before we are hit by the wave, the point is to say very clearly: 'Not here.'\"\n\nShe insisted she isn't attacking parents, saying that most moms don't realize the deeper societal problems the contests represent.\n\n\"When I asked an organizer why there were no mini-boy contests, I heard him respond that boys would not lower themselves like that,\" she said in the Senate debate.\n\nMichel Le Parmentier, who says he has been organizing \"mini-miss\" pageants in France since 1989, passionately defended his business Wednesday.\n\nHe said that he has been in discussions with legislators about regulating such pageants, but wasn't expecting an overall ban. He says his contests forbid make-up and high heels and corporate sponsors, and focus on princess dresses and \"natural beauty\" — and that he shouldn't be lumped in with pedophiles or other contest organizers who capitalize on children for profit.\n\n\"It's just little girls playing princess,\" he told the AP.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that appearances are important, and said there's no point in pretending they're not, at any age.\n\n\"One day or another they will find themselves before this problem of physical appearance. … A woman who has a nice appearance will find a job more easily, a job interview. These things are done based on physical appearance\" even if we like to think they aren't, he said.\n\nHe says that if the law is approved, he will focus his energies on children's talent contests called \"Mini-Stars\" that he has already been conducting.\n\nAnnabelle Betemps, a guest house operator from the Alps, has entered her daughter in multiple pageants and lamented the harshness of the new law.\n\n\"We are hyper-disappointed,\" she said, describing the joys and friendships she and her daughter Barbara, now 13, have experienced thanks to pageants.\n\nShe said preparing children to present themselves on stage is a gift that helps them throughout life.\n\n\"You can't tell me that the Senate will solve the country's problems by banning the mini-miss pageants,\" she said, pleading with legislators to address other ills blighting children such as drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nThe senators debated whether to come up with a softer measure limiting such pageants, but in the end decided on an overall ban.\n\nThe Socialist government's equal rights minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, suggested Wednesday that the Socialists may push for a compromise measure when the bill goes to the lower house of Parliament in the coming weeks. The amendment's author said the proposed punishments might be lightened in later readings but expressed confidence that the ban would survive.\n\nConcerns about child beauty pageants have popped up in several countries in recent years, but regulations are rare.\n\nIn 2006, Sweden, Denmark and Norway pulled out of a pan-European children's song contest and started their own to protest treatment of the contestants, as some were dressed like sexed-up dolls.\n\nControversy has also clouded adult beauty pageants.

Ron DeSantis, and without expressly laying out which platforms are prohibited. TikTok? Facebook? X (Twitter)? Instagram? YouTube?\n\nFlorida Legislature has been working on restricting minors' access to social media for some time, citing fears of bullying, sex trafficking, depression and suicide among the youth. A similar measure fell through in 2023, but it remained a top priority of House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast.\n\nThis year, the Florida House's bill needed some reworking in the Senate to assuage some of DeSantis' concerns about privacy, but it was passed Thursday in the Senate and then, hours after the governor said he didn't think it was there yet, passed unchanged in the House. It now goes to DeSantis' desk.\n\nWhat does Florida HB 1 social media bill do?\n\nHere's what HB 1, Online Protection for Minors, does:\n\nRequires social media platforms to prohibit kids 15 and younger from creating new accounts, terminate existing accounts probably held by kids 15 and younger, and allow parents and children to request termination of accounts.\n\nRequires social media platforms to use reasonable age verification methods to verify the ages of account holders and disclose specified policies and provide specified resources, measures and disclaimers.\n\nAuthorizes the Department of Legal Affairs (DLA) to bring actions for violations under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nProvides penalties.\n\nDeclares that any social media platform accessible in Florida is subject to the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nSupporters of the bill have said the point wasn't to keep children off the platforms but to force platforms to change their addictive ways.\n\nHB 1 also requires people visiting sites with adult material to verify their age through anonymous third-party services.\n\nWhat social media sites does HB 1 target?\n\nGood question, and one the legislators have avoided answering.\n\nInstead, the bill seeks to define qualities and practices the social media platform must have to be affected by the bill. The bill seeks to control online forums, websites or applications that do any of the following:\n\nUse algorithms that select and present content based on user information\n\nUse \"addictive features\" such as infinite scrolling push notifications or alerts visible markers of clicks, likes or reposts Video that plays without the user clicking on a play button Live-streaming functionality\n\nHas 10% or more users 15 years of age or younger who spend, on average, at least 2 hours a day on the platform\n\nThe bill excludes sites and services designed for email or direct messaging.\n\nWhat are the penalties for social media platforms?\n\nThe bill declares any knowing violation by the social media platform to be an \"unfair and deceptive trade practice\" subject to civil penalties up to $50,000 per violation, plus attorney and court costs. Persistent violations may incur punitive damages.\n\nIf the social media platform fails to terminate an account after a request from a minor account holder or their parent or guardian is liable for up to $10,000 in damages, plus attorney fees and court costs.\n\nIt also allows penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for third-party age verification services that violate the bill.\n\nSites or services with \"material harmful to minors\" can be hit with civil penalties from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation for every person under 18 allowed into their platform.\n\nWhat can someone do if their account is mistakenly deleted under the bill?\n\nUnder the bill, there is a minimum of 90 days for an account holder to dispute it and verify their age.\n\nWhen would the social media ban for minors go into effect?\n\nIf the bill is signed by the governor, the new law would go into effect July 1, 2024.\n\nWhat did Ron DeSantis think of the bill? Will he veto it?\n\nIn the hours between the Florida Senate and Florida House passing the bill, Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was hesitant about the bill due to the lack of parental override options.\n\n\"Parents need to have a role in this,\" DeSantis said at a press conference. \"I do think parents are concerned about social media and what goes on there, and I do think they think it's a problem. But I also think that for people that are in high school, it's not as simple.\"\n\nPreviously, DeSantis said he wouldn't support the bill if he didn't think it would pass \"legal muster.\" Similar bills in other states that were not as restrictive have been challenged in court.\n\n\"To say that someone that is 15 just cannot have it no matter what, even if the parent consents, that may create some legal issues,\" DeSantis said in response to a question at a news conference in Kissimmee on semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\"I am concerned about the breadth of it, and I want to empower parents, I want to give parents tools to be able to do this, so I just think you have to be smart with how you do it,\" he added.\n\nDeSantis has not said whether he would sign HB 1 into law.

Mom, I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you.”\n\nDonalds argued that if Trump is elected in November, parent would get further choice over what their children are taught in schools.\n\n“If there was ever a time in our nation to come together, that time is now with Trump,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKristi Noem says Republicans 'have to get to work'\n\nSouth Dakota Gov.

Glenn Youngkin opened his speech by telling his fellow Republicans that “Joe must go.” He touted Trump’s handling of the economy, the energy industry and military.\n\n“I'm proud to be a homegrown Virginian from a family, like a lot of families, with ups and downs and highs and lows,” he said. “My mom was a nurse and she was my hero. She bought our family together after my dad lost his job. At 15 washing dishes and flipping eggs. I learned that there is dignity in work.”\n\nVirginia has been a state in play for this year’s elections, especially as Youngkin, a businessman, defeated his Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial race marking the first time a Republican has won the state’s governor’s office since 2009.\n\n“I believe this year, Virginia will elect another Republican (outsider) businessman as President of the United States,” he said.

Tim Scott of South Carolina told convention-goers Monday, “If you didn’t believe in miracles before Saturday, you better be believing right now,” in a convention address heavy on references to the Republican’s Christian faith.\n\n“Our God still saves. He still delivers,” Scott said, referencing the devastating shooting at Donald Trump's Saturday rally. “Because on Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back up on his feet, and he roared.”\n\nScott ran his own campaign for president before dropping out in November and was then rumored to be on the list of Trump’s potential vice presidential picks.\n\n“Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel, and we’re headed over a cliff,” the senator said Monday. “...America we deserve better.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKatie Britt reaches out to parents in convention remarks\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., in her address at the convention appealed to parents and families as she slammed the economy under the Biden administration.\n\n“To my fellow moms and dads across America, I think we all know that raising a family is hard - add in smartphones and social media, and we already have plenty to worry about,” she said. “But then Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came around. Now our lives are that much more difficult.”\n\nIt was the first high-profile moment for Britt since her rebuttal to Biden's State of the Union address earlier this year. Britt faced scrutiny and jokes after in March after the address, but Trump praised her after the speech, saying she was a \"GREAT contrast to an Angry, and obviously very Disturbed ‘President.”\n\nIn her convention speech, she told Americans across the country “We will defeat decline, dust off our dreams and forge our future because families across our nation deserve better once again.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep.

He added that “we owe it to future generations to embrace this pivotal moment.”\n\n“I risked my life in combat to preserve this nation,” he said, a reference to his military service. “Now, there's another man who was putting it all on the line to save our nation.

My wife and I never gave up. We kept our faith.”\n\nRobinson has appeared with Trump on the campaign trail previously, each Republican nominee having endorsed the other.\n\n“The brave heart of our time President Trump had our economy roaring.” Robinson said Monday, before exiting under a “Make America wealthy once again” backdrop.\n\n“Under President Trump the American dream was alive and well,” he continued. “Under President Trump there was hope. And we need that now more than ever.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene at RNC: 'The American spirit is alive and well'\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene led the first evening of speakers at this year’s GOP convention. The firebrand conservative called the day a celebration, hours after Trump became the official Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“The American spirit is alive and well,” Greene said.\n\n“Unfortunately,” she continued, “this is also a somber moment for our nation. Two days ago, evil came for the man we admire and love so much. I thank God that His hand was on President Trump.”\n\nGreene also acknowledged Corey Comperatore, who died while attending Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.\n\n“We will honor Corey’s memory by building the country he wanted,” Greene said, adding, “For far too long the establishment in Washington has sold us out. They promised unity and delivered division.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nChairman of RNC calls for unity in convention remarks\n\nMichael Whatley, chair of the Republican National Committee, called for unity in both the GOP and as a nation in his remarks to convention attendees following the attempted assassination against Trump over the weekend.\n\n“We must unite as a party and we must unite as a nation.

Vance once compared Trump to Hitler. Now they are running mates\n\nEight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, J.D. Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump.\n\nPublicly, he called the Republican presidential candidate an \"idiot\" and said he was \"reprehensible.\" Privately, he compared him to Adolf Hitler.\n\nBut by the time the former president tapped Vance to be his running mate on Monday, the Ohio native had become one of Trump's most ardent defenders, standing by his side even when other high-profile Republicans declined to do so.\n\n– Reuters\n\nRNC schedule tonight\n\nThe lineup of speakers Monday night includes politicians, businesspeople and celebrities.

Gov. Jon Husted said as he gave the speech formally nominating Vance for vice president. “The vice presidency is an office of sacred trust. The man who accepts this nomination accepts with it the awesome responsibility to give wise counsel to the president, the represent America abroad, to preside over the senate, and to be ready to lead our nation at a moment’s notice.”\n\nOhio U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno made the motion to nominate Vance by acclimation, calling Vance a “selfless and brilliant fighter” for “America first” ideals.\n\nThe motion was adopted to cheers and chants of “JD! JD!” that rang out through the convention hall.\n\n– Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nJD Vance enters convention floor\n\nJ.D.

In a 2016 column he penned for USA TODAY, he differentiated the religiosity of Trump’s voters and those of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, saying the former candidate’s voters had largely “abandoned the faith of their forefathers and myriad social benefits that come with it.”\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nDoug Burgum says JD Vance’s 'small town roots' make him strong voice as running mate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov.

Vance stand on abortion rights – and enacting a nation abortion ban vs. allowing states to set their own restrictions?\n\nShortly after Ohio voters enshrined the right to abortion in its constitution in 2023, Vance told reporters, \"We can’t give in to the idea that the federal Congress has no role in this matter because if it doesn’t, then the pro-life movement is basically not going to exist, I think, for the next couple of years.\"\n\nBut earlier in July, he called Trump a \"pragmatic leader\" for his stance that abortion rights should be a topic left up to the states. During his 2022 Senate campaign, Vance has said a national abortion minimum was \"totally fine\" with him.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nGlenn Youngkin applauds J.D. Vance for new role\n\nVirginia Republican Gov.

J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running-mate, calling the Ohio senator an enabler of Trump’s “extreme MAGA agenda.”\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said a statement.\n\nShe said Vance “will make it his mission” to enact policies outlined in Project 2025, the legislative roadmap of the Trump-aligned Heritage Foundation. O’Malley Dillon also pointed to Vance’s opposition to abortion access and the Affordable Care Act and his past comments that he wouldn’t have certified the 2020 election results.\n\n“Over the next three and a half months, we will spend every single day making the case between the two starkly contrasting visions Americans will choose between at the ballot box this November,” O’Malley Dillon said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'He's going to learn from Trump'\n\nAl Couillard, 65, of Florida said Vance will bring youth to the ticket.\n\n\"He's gonna make a great 48th president. He's going to learn from Trump for four years and be president,\" he said.\n\nCouillard said Vance has a lot to learn and there's no better place than by Trump's side.\n\n\"He's in a perfect position to learn it all under Trump and his administration\" he said. \"That's better than MIT or Harvard or Yale.\"\n\n– Sarah Wire\n\nMitch McConnell gets booed during convention\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was booed by convention attendees as he cast Kentucky’s votes for Trump.\n\nAfter he finished casting his votes, he smiled and held up a thumbs up as the boos continued.\n\nThough McConnell endorsed Trump, their relationship remains icy as McConnell had condemned the Jan. 6 attack and the two have butted heads frequently. Trump and McConnell met for the first time face to face in June after not speaking to each other since December 2020.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump officially clinches GOP nomination\n\nIt's official: Donald Trump is the Republican nominee ....

Vance for vice president.\n\nEric Trump delivered the delegates that formally put Trump over the top.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the united states of America,” he said.\n\n– David Jackson and Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nInfluential think tank president backs Vance\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts was speaking with reporters at a nearby venue when the news about Sen. JD Vance came out. A grin broke across his face; he is close with the senator.“He understands the moment we’re in in this country, which is that we have a limited amount of time to implement great policy on behalf of forgotten Americans, someone JD Vance personifies,” Roberts said. “At Heritage, we could not be happier.”\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is the right-wing think tank that created the controversial \"Project 2025\" blueprint for a potential Trump second term.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nTrump Jr. calls Vance an “incredible” pick\n\nDonald Trump Jr., told CNN on the floor of the convention he believes Vance will be an “incredible” running mate for his father.\n\n“I see him on TV. I see him prosecute the case against the Democrats. I think no one’s more articulate than that,” Trump Jr., said. “And I think his story, his background really helps us in a lot of the places that you’re going to need from the electoral college standpoint.”\n\nVance is a graduate of Yale law school. His memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a narrative of his blue-collar roots in Ohio, powered his rise to fame.\n\nThe former president’s eldest son, who was reportedly advocating for the Ohio senator, said he learned of the official decision as it was made public Monday afternoon.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nResidency issue doomed Rubio’s VP bid\n\nThe fact that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former President Donald Trump live in the same state ultimately doomed his chance of being the GOP vice presidential pick this year.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution doesn’t prevent both members of a party’s ticket from living in the same state, but the delegates from that state can only vote for one of them.\n\nRubio’s team had multiple conversation with Trump’s campaign over the last 10 days about the residency issue, wanting to make sure that there wouldn’t be any legal complications if the Florida senator was selected as the GOP vice presidential nominee, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Ultimately, they weren’t 100% certain there wouldn’t be a problem.\n\nIt’s not clear if Rubio would have been the pick if he lived elsewhere, but his residency ultimately was a deal breaker. It creates a big complication that the Trump campaign wasn’t able to get past, one that Trump commented on publicly.\n\nTrump told Fox News Radio last week that he and Rubio living in the state “does make it more complicated.”\n\n“You do that and it makes it more complicated, there are people that don’t have that complication,” Trump said.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nTrump chooses Vance\n\nTrump’s decision ends months of speculation over who would join the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s ticket as he seeks his political comeback in a November rematch with President Joe Biden.\n\n\"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\" Trump shared in a post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nVance was once a fierce critic of Trump, at times comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be “America’s Hitler.” But Vance changed his tune ahead of the 2022 Senate race, deleted controversial tweets and secured Trump’s support in Ohio’s nasty GOP primary.\n\n-Haley BeMiller\n\nThe VP pick is in\n\nThe first time we will see the VP nominee in-person will be 4:37pm ET/3:37pm CT, at the beginning of the VP nomination process.\n\nA source confirmed that two finalists - Florida Sen.

He said: \"Let us come together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System, and Make America Great Again!\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump likely to announce running mate today\n\nWe will likely get a Trump running mate today.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nFox News anchor Bret Baier said Trump told him he would announce his selection today.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat will security at the RNC look like?\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has “reviewed and strengthened” security measures for the RNC in light of Saturday’s assassination attempt, its director Kimberly Cheatle said on Monday.\n\nCheatle said the agency “continuously adapt” its operations during the RNC “to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee.”\n\nSince the incident on Saturday, she said the Secret Service has also implemented changes to Trump’s detail to ensure his protection through the end of the campaign.\n\n−Rebecca Morin and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump classified documents case is dismissed - for now\n\nRepublicans open their convention Monday after some extraordinary legal news: A dismissal of the classified documents case against Trump, a decision that will likely be appealed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional.\n\nThe government will almost certainly appeal the decision - though Trump could have the entire case dismissed if he regains the presidency.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to announce VP pick on Monday\n\nDonald Trump has yet to announce his vice presidential running mate, and he could do so as soon as Monday.\n\nThe former president teased his plans to name his VP last week in an interview saying that he’d “love to do it during the convention” or “just slightly before the convention, like Monday.”\n\nTrump’s VP short list includes GOP Sens. J.D. Vance from Ohio, Marco Rubio from Florida and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen does Donald Trump speak at the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe presidential nominee traditionally speaks on the last night of the convention, and the vice presidential nominee speaks on the second-to-last night.\n\nTrump may make an appearance and even speak on opening night, on Monday.- Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nTrump says he will tone down acceptance speech after shooting\n\nHaving survived an assassination attempt, Trump and his aides are telling people he will go for a softer tone in his nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\n\"Had this not happened, we had a speech that was pretty well set that was extremely tough,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner. Now, we have a speech that is more unifying.”\n\nBefore Saturday's shooting, Trump said, “I basically had a speech that was an unbelievable rip-roarer. It was brutal — really good, really tough.\"\n\nBut he threw out that version, Trump told the Examiner: \"I think it would be very bad if I got up and started going wild about how horrible everybody is and how corrupt and crooked, even if it’s true.\"\n\nDavid Jackson\n\nWho is speaking at the Republican National convention?\n\nA list of speakers were released on Saturday afternoon that in illustrated the way Donald Trump has completely remade the GOP as the Trump Make America Great Again MAGA party.\n\nOn the list of speakers: Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr., Amber Rose, the University Of North Carolina's frat brothers who held up an American flag during a Gaza protest, UFC's Dana White were all on the list.Old guard GOP politicos like Mitt Romney, George W. Bush. John Thune, were not.Of course, new speakers may be added as the convention is reshaped in light of the weekend assassination attempt.

She urged residents to clear all brush within 200 feet of their homes.\n\n“Flying embers from a wildfire can destroy homes over a mile away,\" Crowley said at a briefing Thursday. She asked residents to provide first responders with a \"fighting chance\" to save homes if the fires spread.\n\nMudslides also are a concern. Los Angeles County Public Works Director Mark Pestrella said he expects \"massive debris flows\" when rains finally come to the region. The county is scrambling to prepare flood control systems for the onslaught, he said.\n\nThe fires have reduced entire neighborhoods along the Pacific Coast and inland near the San Gabriel Mountains to ash and rubble. At least 27 people have died in the fires, 31 others are missing, and more than 12,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nAs many as 200,000 people were forced to flee from their homes at the height of the fires. About 82,400 people remained under evacuation orders and another 90,400 faced evacuation warnings as of Wednesday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Thursday.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Pacific Palisades residents whose homes are on the perimeter of the fire have been allowed to return as of 1 p.m. PT Thursday, the L.A. County Sheriff's Office said.\n\n∎ Before this year, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service had only issued four Red Flag Warnings with the designation of \"particularly dangerous situation,'' starting in October 2020. The office then issued that critical alert twice in the first half of this month.\n\n∎ The Genesis Invitational, a PGA Tour event Tiger Woods was to host next month at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, will be played at a different location because of the fires, the tour said without announcing the new venue.\n\n∎ Power outages declined again Thursday as the slow recovery from the fires continued. Less than 15,000 homes and businesses were without power in Los Angeles County and less than 30,000 in San Bernardino County. Ventura County outages were below 2,000.\n\n∎ The Balmer Group, a foundation started by Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Balmer, announced that it is donating $15 million in emergency funding for the \"many people impacted by these fires, particularly in the historic, racially diverse community of Altadena.\"\n\n∎ On Thursday, the Getty Villa Museum said its center in Brentwood, California, was \"no longer under threat\" and will re-open to the public on Jan. 28.

Relatively light winds late Wednesday and early Thursday aided the efforts by firefighters, Crowley said.\n\n\"We are very fortunate that this last wind event did not cause any expansion of the Palisades Fire,\" Crowley said. \"Together we are able to move forward in the recovery from these devastating fires.\"\n\nThe Palisades Fire was 22% contained Thursday. Aerial imagery shows approximately 5,000 homes, businesses and other structures may have been damaged or destroyed, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe Eaton Fire was 55% contained. At least 6,700 structures have been destroyed, and about 770 others are damaged, according to Cal Fire.\n\nOfficials said in a Thursday evening update that crews were using aerial infrared imaging and helicopters to find and extinguish remaining hotspots in the Eaton Fire.\n\nFBI issues warning for fraudulent charitable donations\n\nThe FBI issued a public service announcement on Thursday warning the public about fraudulent charitable donations related to mass casualty and disaster events.\n\n\"Scammers exploit mass casualty events and disasters, such as the New Year's Day terrorist attack in New Orleans and the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles, to commit fraud by soliciting fake charitable donations to support victims or their families,\" the FBI said.\n\nThe agency added that scammers may impersonate disaster relief agencies, other official entities, celebrities and influencers to collect personal information or solicit donations. The FBI noted that scammers may use artificial intelligence to \"increase perceived legitimacy of a fraud or impersonation.\"\n\nLast year, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 4,500 complaints reporting about $96 million in losses to fraudulent charities, crowdfunding accounts, and disaster relief campaigns.\n\nHow long do wildfires last? Answer is elusive\n\nThe gradual progress in the containment of the Palisades and Eaton fires, the two largest blazes burning in Los Angeles County, raises the question of how long wildfires typically last in California.\n\nThere's no single answer, according to Cal Fire information officer Scotty McLean, who said fuel type, topography and the weather are the main determinants. Fire crews try to make sure they extinguish these infernos completely before moving on to prevent hotspots lingering under the surface from sparking another blaze.\n\nWind is a major factor in determining duration because flying embers can reignite a seemingly dormant fire. Jim Menakis, branch chief for fire ecology with the Forest Service, said he doesn't expect the Los Angeles blazes to endure for months because they are partially contained in a geographic area, but the winds must die down \"significantly\" for them to be put out.\n\n\"There’s no certain metrics of saying, 'We expect it to be out in 14 days based on these conditions,''' Menakis said, \"because it’s hard to predict those kind of things and these winds are challenging.''\n\n− Paris Barraza, Palm Springs Desert Sun\n\nResidents distressed as they're kept away from homes\n\nAs conditions improve, some residents are growing increasingly frustrated about not being allowed to return to their homes.\n\n\"You can see the emotional toll that this disaster has taken on people, as I spoke to people who had lost their homes or who were not sure the status of their homes or missing pets,'' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said.\n\nOfficials said some evacuees may not be able to return home for another week as emergency responders remove toxic waste and cut off electricity and gas lines posing a hazard amid the ruins. In addition, the search for human remains continues.\n\n\"There are areas that we are holding because we believe there may be deceased victims there,'' Luna said. \"We have to hold for the right time and the right resources to process the scene correctly, and that's going to take a little while.\"\n\nJudges, court staff lose homes in wildfires\n\nAt least 36 judges and employees in federal and state courts have lost their homes in the wildfires, court officials said.\n\nBy the end of Wednesday, nearly all federal and state courthouses in Los Angeles County were open for business and conducting court proceedings following some earlier closures, though the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Pasadena courthouse remains closed.\n\nBut court officials said they were now in the process of evaluating the extent to which the wildfires have impacted their personnel, who in many cases had been displaced and in some cases lost their homes in the devastating blazes.\n\n“The court is actively evaluating the extent and magnitude of the firestorm's impact on our court community,\" Rob Oftring, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Superior Court, said in a statement.\n\n— Reuters\n\nHelp arriving from near and far, and in creative ways\n\nFrom housekeepers suddenly without a job to parents desperate to appease a child who lost a favorite teddy bear, the L.A.

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday to help with housing needs of thousands of evacuees displaced by the fires. The order directs state departments to support local governments in developing temporary housing plans and streamlines construction and occupancy of \"accessory dwelling units\" − small living spaces that share lots with larger homes.\n\nThe order also makes it easier to place temporary trailers and other housing on the property while destroyed or damaged residences are rebuilt, and it extends price gouging bans on hotel, motel and rental housing in Los Angeles County to March 8.\n\n\"Today, we are expediting the creation of new temporary housing by removing roadblocks and strengthening protections against exploitation,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nSevere drought adds to fire worries\n\nA \"severe drought\" designation was expanded to include all of Southern California because of a dry start to the water year that began Oct. 1, according to the federal Drought Monitor summary released Thursday. The severe drought designation means year-to-date precipitation has averaged less than 5% of normal. The designation includes Los Angeles and Ventura counties, where the wildfires have been burning.\n\nThe summary noted that the dry start to the water year comes after two years of wet winters for the region. Wet winters lead to the growth of more vegetation that can serve fuel for fires when it is dried out by drought conditions.\n\nFederal Labor Department OKs $10 million in relief funding\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department on Thursday approved up to $10 million for California in emergency grants to pay for disaster-relief jobs and training, with an initial release of $1 million, the department announced.\n\n“This Dislocated Worker Grant will help to support California and its incredible, vibrant, diverse people as they begin what will be a long recovery,” said Julie Su, acting labor secretary.\n\nThe grant program allows the state’s Employment Development Department to provide temporary disaster-relief jobs and humanitarian assistance for immediate, basic needs for people displaced by the fires.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nDoes LA really want rain? Why that could ignite a disaster of another kind\n\nResidents contemplate rebuilding better\n\nAs fires continue to burn across Los Angeles County, conversations are already beginning about whether, and how, to rebuild. In an area known for astronomical real estate prices, a housing market in crisis and the ever-present danger of natural disasters like fires, earthquakes and mudslides – the challenges can feel overwhelming. Becky Nicolaides, whose home was destroyed, told USA TODAY that she and her family are unlikely to move back and rebuild their piece of paradise. But she also views the fires as a lesson in urban development.\n\n“If we go back now and try to rebuild these places, do we want to do it exactly as they were?” she questioned. “I don't think it's a good idea. This could be, on some level ... a kind of unanticipated opportunity to build back in a better way.” Read more here.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nHilton providing free hotel rooms\n\nHilton and American Express announced a partnership to make 20,000 hotel room nights available at no cost for evacuees across the greater Los Angeles area.

Hundreds of evacuees have sought refuge in the Pasadena Convention Center and other Red Cross and \"partner\" shelters, the agency said in a statement.\n\nDisaster health volunteers are caring for minor injuries and replacing things such as eyeglasses and medications while mental health workers are providing emotional support to those experiencing unimaginable loss. Financial assistance programs also were being launched, the agency said.\n\nJet Propulsion Lab employees lost homes in Eaton Fire\n\nScientists and other personnel at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory just outside Pasadena have been working remotely since the lab was forced to close more than a week ago. The federally funded research and development center is in the Eaton Fire evacuation zone, and lab director Laurie Leshin said many have lost their homes. The lab remained closed except for \"essential activities,\" she said.\n\n\"We are providing critical support to firefighting helicopters,\" she said in a social media post. \"We are focused on our @NASAJPL community. 200 JPLers have lost everything.\"\n\nMartin Lo, 72, a principal mission designer at JPL, and his husband William Wentzel lost their home in the fire. They told the Pasadena Star-News they have heard from many friends, some they haven’t seen for decades, offering them places to stay.\n\n“It was really heartwarming,” Lo said. “We lost things but it seems like we have great riches in our friends and colleagues and students.”\n\nNewsom bans 'predatory' land offers\n\nResidents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles-area wildfires a week ago are already being offered buyouts for their prime real estate − and now Newsom is stepping in to block land speculators.\n\nIn an executive order issued Tuesday, Newsom temporarily banned \"unsolicited undervalued offers\" to buy properties in 15 specific fire-damaged ZIP codes, including Altadena and Pacific Palisades, which were burned by the Eaton and Palisades fires respectively.\n\n\"As families mourn, the last thing they need is greedy speculators taking advantage of their pain,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"We will not allow greedy developers to rip off these working-class communities at a time when they need more support than ever before.\" Read more here.\n\n'The ecosystem is going to change'\n\nNext time it rains, miles of canyons and hillsides charred by wildfires will send debris rushing down ravines and through drainage ditches into the Pacific Ocean.

More than half, 54%, of respondents described Trump as “very disrespectful.”\n\nTony Hinchliffe, a comedian who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and made other offensive jokes about Latinos and Black Americans at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. Trump was met with backlash, including among Puerto Rican voters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he held a rally two days later.\n\nThe poll found 70% of Latinos in the state thought the remark was more racist than humorous. Only 16% said they saw the comment intended as a joke rather than serious commentary. More than three in four (77%) of Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania believe Trump is very disrespectful to Latinos.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump will be heading to the state in the closing days of the election.

Judge Robert E. Flournoy III also called for segregating the ballots at issue that arrive in the new window of permitted time, which could be a precaution in case there are further questions or litigation about them.\n\nThe order comes the same day the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center sued Cobb County election officials, who already admitted that, as of Wednesday, there were more than 3,000 requested ballots that hadn't been sent out. The officials said there was an equipment issue, but most of the ballots would be sent by express or overnight mail by Friday with prepaid express return envelopes.\n\nFlournoy required the officials to meet their pledge, and also ordered them to notify affected voters where possible that the ballots had been sent out and the voters could also vote in person on Election Day, Tuesday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPennsylvania court orders remedies for nearly 20,000 missing absentee ballots\n\nA Pennsylvania court ordered the Erie County Board of Elections on Friday to offer new absentee ballots to nearly 20,000 voters who didn’t receive them and stay open for longer office hours until Election Day to receive them.\n\nCourt of Common Pleas Judge David Ridge ordered the remedy after holding a hearing Thursday about problems the election office and its vendor, ElectionIQ, had in delivering ballots through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe number of missing ballots in just one county of the key battleground state is potentially significant. Former President Donald Trump won the state by about 40,000 votes in 2016 and President Joe Biden won it by about 80,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe vendor couldn’t confirm the status of 13,000 to 17,000 absentee ballots that were requested before the deadline, Ridge wrote.\n\nIn addition, 1,200 county residents who requested ballots from being temporarily out of state said they hadn’t received ballots, Ridge wrote.\n\nAnd 365 duplicate ballots were sent to voters with barcodes that matched different voters, Ridge wrote.\n\nTo remedy the problem, the Court of Common Pleas in Erie ordered the elections office in the county courthouse to:\n\n- Stay open longer on Friday and Monday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n- Provide the voters with missing ballots new ones that could be returned to the office or a drop box there.\n\n- Send new ballots to out-of-state voters by overnight mail.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nPennsylvania holds firm on wrong date absentee ballots\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court reiterated its previously rulings Friday that county election officials not count absentee ballots that are undated or mistakenly dated, overturning a lower-court decision in Philadelphia that said the ballots should be counted.\n\nThe unsigned decision said courts shouldn’t change election rules so close to the Nov. 5 election. The state had 2.1 million absentee ballots approved and nearly 1.5 million returned by Wednesday, but it won’t be clear how many have mistaken dates until they are processed on Election Day on Tuesday.\n\nState law prohibits counting ballots with missing or mistaken dates. The state Supreme Court upheld the law in September and October.\n\nBut a Commonwealth Court decision found that ballots with date mistakes in a Philadelphia special election should be counted despite “meaningless dating provisions” in state law. The Supreme Court blocked that decision for the general election.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley called the decision “another big win for election integrity.”\n\n“The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the law, and the dated ballot requirement will be in effect for this election,” Whatley said. “Democrats have repeatedly tried to eliminate this important ballot safeguard, and we have stopped them each time.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump makes direct appeal to Black voters in Michigan\n\nTrump repeated his criticized claims that migrants are taking jobs from African Americans, during a speech in Warren, Mich., Friday.\n\nAnd he touted his first administration’s record in a direct appeal to Black voters.\n\n“With the exception of, who? Abraham Lincoln. I did more as president for the Black population than any other president in the history of our country,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe former president has previously highlighted the historically low unemployment rate for Black Americans when he was in the White House. But the record for lowest unemployment rate for Black Americans in U.S. history now belongs to President Joe Biden.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nGeorgia county election board members sued for not sending 3,000 absentee ballots\n\nThe ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center on Friday sued election board members for Georgia's Cobb County, which is near Atlanta, for failing to send out 3,000 absentee ballots that were requested on time.\n\nThe legal groups want a Georgia court to order the board members to send the ballots through overnight mail and to include overnight return mailing for voters. They also want the ballots accepted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day, Nov. 5, and received by Nov. 8 – Georgia's current deadline to receive ballots for overseas and uniformed voters. The current receipt deadline for the absentee ballots is Election Day.\n\nIn a Thursday press release, the elections board admitted to the mistake, faulting some of its equipment. It said more than 3,000 requested absentee ballots hadn't been mailed as of Wednesday, and it will send most of them through express or overnight mail by Friday morning with prepaid express return envelopes. It noted voters who haven't received their absentee ballots can still vote in person.\n\n“Our team has been working around the clock to get the ballots out,\" Cobb County Elections Director Tate Fall said in a statement included in the press release.\n\nThe legal groups said Friday that the board's proposed fixes for voters \"are not nearly enough to safeguard their right to vote.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nArizona attorney general to investigate Trump’s Cheney comments\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Friday that her office will probe if remarks Trump made about former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney violates the law.\n\n“I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,” Mayes, a Democrat, told NBC affiliate 12News.\n\nCheney, who was top Republian on the special House panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election, has campaigned for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump made the remarks during an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson at a campaign stop in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nLater, Trump clarified: “All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have ‘the guts’ to fight herself,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“There’s no true threat here. No call to commence imminent violence,” Anthony Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University said in a social media post. “His statement was vile, repugnant, and corrosive to our politics, but it is protected speech.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nHarris: Trump’s violent rhetoric ‘must be disqualifying’\n\nHarris on Friday condemned Trump’s comments that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney should face armed combat over her support for U.S. wars overseas, saying that it “must be disqualifying” for the presidency.\n\n“He has increased his violent rhetoric − Donald Trump has − about political opponents and in great detail, in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying,” she told reporters ahead of a rally in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris added that any candidate who uses that kind of “violent” rhetoric is “clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.”\n\nTrump made his remarks in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson at a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nThe White House on Friday also condemned Trump’s remarks, calling them unacceptable.\n\n“There is no place anywhere for any type of violence,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “And this is a time we shouldn’t be using inflammatory language. We should be specifically focusing on bringing the country together, and that’s what the president wants to see.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi and Michael Collins\n\nTrump: Kennedy will have 'big role in healthcare'\n\nAt a campaign stop in Dearborn, Mich., Friday, Trump was fielding questions from the press when former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared beside him.\n\nGesturing to Kennedy, Trump told reporters, \"He's going to have a big role in healthcare.\"\n\nKennedy is perhaps best known for his anti-vaccine advocacy and conspiracy theories.\n\n]In 2023, the New York Post published a video of Kennedy, the son of slain Sen. Robert Kennedy and a nephew of the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, speculating that Covid-19 had been engineered to spare people of Jewish and Chinese heritage.\n\n“COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people,\" he said in the video. \"The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.”\n\nIn a call with supporters earlier this week, Kennedy said Trump had \"promised\" him control of public health agencies. But a Trump transition team co-chair walked that back days later, telling CNN that Kennedy would not be named to any such position.\n\nTrump on Friday said he agrees with many of Kennedy's ideas, without giving specifics.\n\nHarris criticized Trump over the potential decision, telling reporters in Wisconsin Friday that Kennedy is \"the exact last person in America who should be setting health care policy for America’s families and children.”\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\n'He's talking about sharks': Milwaukee mayor mocks Trump\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson made fun of former President Donald Trump on Friday night for his tendency to get off topic at his rallies.\n\nJohnson began the riff by slamming Trump for reportedly calling the city “horrible” in a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers earlier in the year.\n\n“He called us horrible,” Jones said. “This man… he’s out there, he’s rambling on and on, he’s talking about sharks and batteries, he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter.”\n\nHe continued, “He’s talking about immigrants who are, on the one hand, coming from insane asylums, and on the other hand, taking your jobs.

Please talk to your friends, family, and neighbors,” she said.\n\nHarris added, “For anyone who’s not yet voted, no judgment.”\n\nIt was Harris’ second rally of the day in Wisconsin, where more than 700,000 people had voted early as of Thursday morning. She had one earlier in Janesville and will speak in the evening in a suburb of Milwaukee.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nWomen’s March to host events Saturday before election\n\nThousands are expected to attend a #WeWontGoBack march in the nation’s capital and at locations across the country Saturday.\n\nAttendees in Washington plan to march from Freedom Plaza to the White House beginning at 3 p.m. ET. The event will also feature mobile truck billboards reading, “We Won’t Back Down on Abortion,” according to organizers.\n\nThe march falls three days before the Nov. 5 election, capping a race that has been defined by a historic gender divide.\n\nThe Women’s March started as a worldwide protest on Jan. 21, 2017, the day after former President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Crowd scientists estimated the Washington march drew over 470,000 people and that millions participated in local marches nationwide.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nClimate change on voters’ minds after hurricanes, poll finds\n\nVoters in states affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton might be thinking more about climate change when they cast a ballot next Tuesday.\n\nIn North Carolina, Florida, and Georgia, 32% of voters said recent storms made climate a more important issue, according to a Climate Cabinet poll released Friday. That is 4% higher than the national average.\n\nAcross the country, 51% of respondents said they believed extreme weather events are becoming more frequent because of man-made climate change. Only 21% said an increase in extreme weather events is not caused by man-made climate change.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 voters in each state, totaling 3,000, had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points. The national poll of 2,000 adults had a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nRussian misinformation video gaining traction in Georgia, intelligence officials say\n\nA video claiming that Haitian nationals are voting illegally in multiple counties in Georgia is a work Russian misinformation, multiple intelligence agencies wrote in a joint statement Friday.\n\nThe statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Cyber Infrastructure and Security Agency, and the FBI came in addition to public comments from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office identifying the video as false.\n\n“This Russian activity is part of Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans,” the statement said, warning that the coming days could see “additional media content that seeks to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and divide Americans.”\n\nGabriel Sterling, chief operations officer for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also refuted the claims on X after it was shared to the account of Amy Kremer, a Georgia resident whose organization coordinated Donald Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, rally on the Ellipse.\n\n“No responsible person would retweet this ridiculously obvious lie and disinformation,” Sterling said. “Those doing so are acting to further the efforts of America’s enemies and undermine the security of our nation.”\n\n−Erin Mansfield\n\nSchumer predicts Dem Senate wins in Texas, Florida and... Nebraska?\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told supporters earlier this week that he thinks Democrats could flip three seats on Election Day, despite the party's steep odds to retain control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have \"decent changes\" of picking up Texas, Florida and Nebraska, Schumer said during a virtual rally Wednesday. The remarks were first reported by POLITICO.\n\nHowever, the candidate running against incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer in Nebraska is a registered nonpartisan and has said he won't caucus with either party. Independent candidate Dan Osborn told POLITICO Friday that Schumer will get \"a rude awakening if he thinks I'm taking orders from him.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is running against Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, while Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is up against former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.

JD Vance opened his rally in Portage, Michigan, on Friday by taking on billionaire Mark Cuban’s comments that Trump doesn’t surround himself with “strong, intelligent women, ever.”\n\nThe vice presidential candidate called out his wife Usha Vance, who made an appearance with him.\n\n“I thought to myself, 'Well, Mark, you know my wife is way out of your league,'” said Vance, adding that he’s especially grateful that she’s with him at the rally.\n\n“So is Melania Trump, by the way. So is Susie Wiles, who's running the Trump campaign,” Vance said.\n\nCuban made his remarks on “The View” Thursday, and later apologized on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“When I said this during the interview, I didn't get it out exactly the way I thought I did,” he wrote.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nLegendary presidential forecaster has 'crows' in his stomach\n\nHistorian Allan Lichtman, who accurately predicted nine of the last 10 presidential elections, said he still thinks Kamala Harris will beat Donald Trump but that he feels particularly anxious this year.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years and every four years I have butterflies in my stomach,\" he said in a video on his YouTube channel. \"This year, I think I have a flock of crows in my stomach.\"\n\nLichtman said the candidates' neck-and-neck polling in key swing states does not make him nervous but that he is worried about the fragility of the country's democracy.\n\nBoth presidential campaigns have cast their rival as a \"threat to democracy\" during the 2024 cycle. Trump has called Harris a \"communist\" and Harris has called Trump a \"fascist.\"\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nHarris narrowly leads Trump in three ‘blue wall’ states, Marist polls find\n\nVice President Kamala Harris holds narrow leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan in Wisconsin four days from the presidential election, according to new polls of the three \"blue wall\" states released Friday by Marist College that show the Democratic nominee gaining with independent voters.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Harris is ahead of Republican nominee Donald Trump 50%-48% among likely voters, Marist found, and leads Trump 51%-48% in Michigan and 50%-48% in Wisconsin.\n\nThe polls − some of the most encouraging surveys for Harris in recent days − were taken Oct. 27 to Oct. 30. Each result is within the polls' margins of errors of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points in Pennsylvania, 3.5 percentage points in Michigan and 3.4 percentage points in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris is buoyed in the polls by independent voters shifting her direction. In Pennsylvania, Harris leads 55%-40% with independents, Marist found, a turnaround after Trump had a 4-point advantage with Pennsylvania's independent voters in September. Harris leads among independent voters 52%-46% in Michigan and 51%-46% in Wisconsin.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nTrump and Harris are both in a tight race in Nevada\n\nA new Emerson College/RealClearWorld poll released Friday found that among 700 likely voters, 48% said they would back Harris and 47% said they would back Trump. Two percent said they support a third-party, two percent said they were undecided and one percent said they won’t vote for either candidate.\n\nThe poll also highlighted the notable gender gap between the campaigns.\n\n“Men and women in Nevada break in near opposite directions,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a news release. “Men break for Trump by nine percentage points, 52% to 43%, while women break for Harris by eight points, 52 to 44%.”\n\nThe poll was conducted between Oct. 29 and Oct. 31. Both candidates are within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell says 2024 election is the tightest she’s seen\n\nMichigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said on CNN This Morning on Friday that she’s been through enough elections to say that she’s “never seen a tighter election.”\n\nDingell famously warned Democrats during the 2016 election that then candidate Hillary Clinton was in trouble with Michigan voters, and later wrote in an op-ed that the party didn’t listen.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris are deadlocked in the state, numerous polls show. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Harris and Trump are tied, 47% to 47%, among 500 likely voters.\n\nDingell said that Trump is working the state “very hard” and said that it was Michigan that delivered his presidency in 2016. She praised Harris for making “significant progress” with different groups including union workers.\n\n“I think that the African American community is much more engaged than I saw them a month ago. The Hispanic community, which quite frankly, wasn't as energized has become energized this week, but there are other issues on the ground, so we just have a lot of work to do between now and Tuesday night when those polls close,” Dingell said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBrad Raffensperger warns of foreign interference in election, debunks viral video\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger issued a statement on Thurday night addressing a viral video that he said purportedly featured a Haitan immigrant claiming to have voted multiple times.\n\n“This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections,” he said. “It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.”\n\nHe added that the Cybsecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is investigating the origin of the video, and said it is likely “a production of Russian troll farms.”\n\nRaffensperger also called on the leaders of social media platforms, including Elon Musk, to take the video down.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSenate poll roundup: Democrats have narrow edge in Rust Belt, Southwest\n\nDemocratic Senate candidates continue to poll ahead of their GOP opponents in tight races in the Rust Belt and Southwest.\n\nIncumbent Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., polled 3 points ahead of Republican Dave McCormick in a new poll from USA TODAY and Suffolk University conducted from Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of +/- 5.65 percentage points.\n\nCasey also polled ahead of McCormick by 2 percentage points in a new poll from Marist conducted Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points.\n\nBecause both poll results are within the margin of error, it means the candidates could also reasonably be tied or McCormick could be slightly ahead.\n\nTwo other new polls from Marist conducted over the same time frame in Michigan and Wisconsin show Democratic candidates there -- Rep. Elissa Slotkin in Michigan and Sen. Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin -- beating their GOP opponents former Rep. Mike Rogers and businessman Eric Hovde by 6 and 3 percentage points respectively.\n\nThe Michigan poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points and the Wisconsin poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points.\n\nAnd incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is polling ahead of Republican nominee Sam Brown by 4 percentage points in Nevada, according to a new Emerson College poll with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points. That poll was conducted Oct. 29 to 31.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nJennifer Lopez says ‘every Latino in this country’ offended by Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally\n\nActress and singer Jennifer Lopez said at Harris’ rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday that Trump has “consistently worked to divide us.”\n\nShe referenced Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, during which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” Lopez’s parents are both from Puerto Rico.\n\n“At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,” Lopez said, referring to Trump. “It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day, OK? It was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character.”\n\nShe then urged the crowd to get out to vote.\n\n“You know what? We should be emotional. We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should. Our pain matters. We matter,” Lopez said. “Your voice and your vote matters.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nLiz Cheney blasts Trump on X for ‘war hawk’ comment\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Liz Cheney criticized Trump on X, formerly Twitter, after he called her a “war hawk” and said that guns should be “trained on her face.”\n\n“This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant,” Cheney wrote on X with the hashtags #Womenwillnotbesilenced and #VoteKamala.\n\nTrump made the comments during an interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson at an event in Glendale, Arizona. He claimed that she wanted to keep American troops in Syria and Iraq.\n\n“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?,” he said. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”\n\nTrump’s disparaging rhetoric about his political opponents has increased with the Nov. 5 general election approaching - with the Cheney comments being the latest. He’s previously labeled his opponents “garbage” and “human scum.”\n\nCheney, one of Trump’s most vocal critics, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and has been campaigning with her in recent weeks. She was previously the vice chair of the now-dissolved House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and has condemned the former president’s actions on that day.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow will election affect Trump's legal fate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is involved in four criminal cases, but the most important verdict in his legal future may be delivered on Election Day on Tuesday. If he wins, all his charges could be dropped or postponed for at least four years. If he loses, he potentially faces swift sentencing in one case and trials in the other three.\n\nIf Trump were not a candidate for president, his legal trouble would be unavoidable. He is currently scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money case. Two trials loom − one in federal court in Washington, D.C., and one in Georgia state court − on charges he tried to steal the 2020 election. In Florida, a Trump-appointed federal judge dismissed charges that Trump mishandled classified documents after leaving the White House. But that reprieve could be temporary, as prosecutors appealed the decision.\n\n-Bart Jansen and Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris and Trump neck and neck in Pennsylvania\n\nWith days before Tuesday's Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania, one of several key swing states that could determine the winner, a new exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk poll shows.\n\nHarris and Trump are tied with 49% of the vote each, according to a statewide poll of 500 likely voters conducted from Oct. 27 to 30 with a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nA poll of 300 likely voters in Erie County, which could indicate which way the state trends, was also tied 48% to 48%. Northampton County, another Pennsylvania bellwether, leaned slightly towards Trump, with 50% saying they supported him, to Harris' 48%. The results of the county polls are within the margin of error of 5.65 percentage points.\n\n--Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Trump and Harris stand in the polls?\n\nThe 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn Monday, a NASA spacecraft will deliberately slam into an asteroid called Dimorphos.\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission, or DART, aims to see if this kind of kinetic impact can help deflect an asteroid posing a threat to Earth.\n\nThis illustration shows the DART spacecraft heading toward the asteroid Dimorphos. John Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“We are moving an asteroid,” said Tom Statler, NASA program scientist for the DART mission. “We are changing the motion of a natural celestial body in space. Humanity has never done that before.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about this mission.\n\nWhat exactly is DART?\n\nThe DART spacecraft is about the size of a school bus. It has been traveling to reach its asteroid target since launching in November 2021. The spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid system on September 26. Impact is expected at 7:14 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nThe spacecraft is heading for a double-asteroid system, where a tiny “moon” asteroid, named Dimorphos, orbits a larger asteroid, Didymos.\n\nDidymos. which means “twin” in Greek, is roughly 2,560 feet (780 meters) in diameter. Meanwhile, Dimorphos measures 525 feet (160 meters) across, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos is at risk of colliding with Earth – before or after the collision takes place.\n\nWhat will DART do?\n\nDART is going down in a blaze of glory. It will set its sights on Dimorphos, accelerate to 13,421 miles per hour (21,600 kilometers per hour) and crash into the moon nearly head-on.\n\nThe spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nInstead, DART will try to change the asteroid’s speed and path in space. The mission team has compared this collision to a golf cart crashing into one of the Great Pyramids – enough energy to leave an impact crater.\n\nThe impact will change Dimorphos’ speed by 1% as it orbits Didymos. It doesn’t sound like much, but doing so will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet.\n\nWhat will we get to see?\n\nThe spacecraft will share its view of the double-asteroid system through an instrument known as the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation, or DRACO.\n\nThis imager, which serves as DART’s eyes, will allow the spacecraft to identify the double-asteroid system and distinguish which space object it’s supposed to strike.\n\nThis instrument also is a high-resolution camera that aims to capture images of the two asteroids to be streamed back to Earth at a rate of one image per second in what will appear nearly like a video. You can watch the live stream on NASA’s website, beginning at 6 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nDidymos and Dimorphos will appear as pinpricks of light about an hour before impact, gradually growing larger and more detailed in the frame.\n\nDimorphos has never been observed before, so scientists can finally take in its shape and the appearance of its surface.\n\nWe should be able to see Dimorphos in exquisite detail before DART crashes into it. Given the time it takes for images to stream back to Earth, they will be visible for eight seconds before a loss of signal occurs and DART’s mission ends – if it was successful.\n\nThe spacecraft also has its own photojournalist along for the ride.\n\nA briefcase-size satellite from the Italian Space Agency hitched a ride with DART into space. Called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, or LICIACube, it detached from the spacecraft on September 11. The satellite is traveling behind DART to record what happens from a safe perspective.\n\nThree minutes after impact, LICIACube will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video of the impact plume and maybe even spy on the impact crater. The CubeSat will turn to keep its cameras pointed at Dimorphos as it flies by.\n\nThe images and video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the days and weeks following the collision.\n\nHow will we know if the mission was successful?\n\nThe LICIACube won’t be the only observer watching. The James Webb Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and NASA’s Lucy mission will observe the impact. The Didymos system may brighten as its dust and debris is ejected into space, said Statler, the NASA program scientist.\n\nBut ground-based telescopes will be key in determining if DART successfully changed the motion of Dimorphos.\n\nThe Didymos system was discovered in 1996, so astronomers have plenty of observations of the system. After the impact, observatories around the world will watch as Dimorphos crosses in front of and moves behind Didymos.\n\nDimorphos takes 11 hours and 55 minutes to complete an orbit of Didymos. If DART is successful, that time could decrease by 73 seconds, “but we actually think we’re going to change it by about 10 minutes,” said Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nStatler said he would be surprised if a measurement of the period change came in less than a few days but even more so if it took more than three weeks.\n\nWhat if DART misses and doesn’t hit the asteroid?\n\n“I’m highly confident that we were going to hit on Monday, and it will be a complete success,” said Lindley Johnson, NASA planetary defense officer.\n\nBut if DART misses its proverbial dart board, the team will be ready to ensure the spacecraft is safe and all its information downloaded to figure out why it didn’t hit Dimorphos.\n\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory’s Mission Operations Center will intervene if necessary, even though DART will have been operating autonomously for the final four hours of its journey.\n\nIt takes 38 seconds for a command to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, so the team can react quickly. The DART team has 21 contingency plans it has rehearsed, said Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at the Applied Physics Lab.\n\nWhy do we need to test this, and why on this asteroid?\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is comparable to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. An asteroid the size of Dimorphos could cause “regional devastation” if it hit Earth.\n\nThe asteroid system is “the perfect natural laboratory” for the test, Statler said.\n\nThe mission will allow scientists to have a better understanding of the size and mass of each asteroid, which is crucial to understanding near-Earth objects.\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with an orbit that places them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) from Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.\n\nWhy don’t we just blow up the asteroid, like in ‘Armageddon’?\n\nMovies make combating asteroid approaches seem like a hurried scramble to protect the planet, but “that’s not the way to do planetary defense,” Johnson said. Blowing up an asteroid could be more dangerous because then its pieces could be on a collision course with Earth.\n\nBut NASA is considering other methods of changing the motion of asteroids.\n\nThe DART spacecraft is considered to be a kinetic impactor that could change the speed and path of Dimorphos. If DART is successful, it could be one tool for deflecting asteroids.\n\nAnother option is a gravity tractor, which relies on mutual gravitational attraction between a spacecraft and an asteroid to tug the space rock out of its impacting trajectory into a more benign one, Johnson said.\n\nAnother technique is ion beam deflection, or shooting an ion engine at an asteroid for long periods of time until the ions change the asteroid’s velocity and orbit.\n\nBut both of these take time.\n\n“Any technique that you can imagine that changes the orbital speed of the asteroid in orbit is a viable technique,” Johnson said.\n\nAn international forum called the Space Planning Commission has brought 18 national space agencies together to assess what might be best to deflect an asteroid, depending on its size and path.\n\nFinding populations of hazardous asteroids and determining their sizes are priorities of NASA and its international partners, Johnson said. The design for a space-based telescope called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission is currently in review.\n\nWill any other spacecraft fly by Dimorphos in the future?\n\nThe Didymos system won’t be lonely for too long. To survey the aftermath of the impact, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will launch in 2024. The spacecraft, along with two CubeSats, will arrive at the asteroid system two years later.\n\nHera will study both asteroids, measure physical properties of Dimorphos, and examine the DART impact crater and the moon’s orbit, with the aim of establishing an effective planetary defense strategy.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/10/03/is-earth-destined-for-extinction-level-asteroid-event-the-excerpt/75497303007/", "title": "Is Earth destined for an extinction-level asteroid event? | The Excerpt", "text": "On a special episode (first released on October 2, 2024) of The Excerpt podcast: Hollywood has long been enamored with end-of-the-world science fiction where asteroids play the leading role.

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt.\n\nIt's called Apophis. The asteroid has a tiny chance of hitting Earth on Friday the 13th in April of 2029. That chance depends on it being hit by another asteroid or some other object in space at just the right angle to redirect it and send it our way. To date, scientists haven't zeroed in on any imminent asteroid threats, you know the kind that wiped out dinosaurs, but does that mean definitively that there couldn't be more hurtling towards Earth? How at-risk is mankind, and what steps are scientists taking to avert a catastrophic collision, and is it possible or even a good idea to attempt to rearrange things in space?\n\nJoining us now to discuss how scientists are working to literally save the planet is scientist and author, Robin George Andrews. His new book, How to Kill an Asteroid, is out now. Thanks for being on The Excerpt, Robin.\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nHey, thanks so much for having me.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nIn your book, you vividly describe the impact of a football-field-sized asteroid like Apophis hitting Earth. City-killers, asteroids large enough to wipe out an entire metropolitan area, are terrifying. What's the actual risk of one of these asteroids hitting Earth?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nSo yes, asteroids that we often think of as threatening the planet are these sort of planet killer-sized asteroids, which are several miles wide, crash into the planet, wipe everyone out, the sort of thing that happened to the dinosaurs. But actually the threat, as you mentioned, are these city-killer asteroids.\n\nNow, these are very, very small, tens to hundreds of meters, so a few hundred feet, and there are about 25,000 of them in near-Earth orbits. They orbit the sun sort of relatively close to the Earth. The problem is, scientists have only found just under half of those, so those ones aren't a threat. The orbits aren't coming in contact with Earth in the next century or much longer. But we don't know what the others are doing, so until we find those and find out what they're doing, we don't really know what the day-to-day threat is. So, keep paying your mortgage, but just hope the scientists will speed this detection quest up a little bit.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo, you're saying that an asteroid large enough to wipe out life on Earth as it did with the dinosaurs, that's not a valid fear, really to focus on these smaller, more frequent asteroid strikes?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nThat's right. Within a human lifetime or several human lifetimes, a planet-killer is not something that we should worry about. We've found pretty much all of the ones that orbit around Earth, but these city-killers are stealthy. They're very small, they can come out of nowhere, so yeah, they're the things that, again, not a day-to-day worry. But if you live to 100, there's something like a one in 200 chance of a city-killer finding its way towards Earth. Could land in the ocean, could be fine, but could hit a city, so how lucky do we feel, really?\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nTwo years ago, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, successfully altered the trajectory of an asteroid. How did they do it and how were they able to keep it from bumping into another asteroid, potentially changing its trajectory?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nSo cool, this mission. NASA have long wanted to test a planetary defense technique, and in this case, it was hitting an asteroid really hard with a spacecraft to change its trajectory. Now, they say you couldn't do that with any asteroid. If it was just on its own, you could deflect it onto a dangerous course, so what they did is they picked a binary asteroid system. There's a larger asteroid called Didymos, and around that, like a moon, is the one called Dimorphos. They reasoned that if they hit Dimorphos, the moon-like asteroid, it would change its orbit around the bigger one, but it wouldn't change their overall orbit around the sun, so it was a perfectly safe way to practice saving the world. It was pretty clever.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nYou've said that asteroid impacts could be the one natural disaster we can prevent. The DART mission was a significant milestone. How do you see it shaping planetary defense strategies in the future? Is a global effort called for here?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nIt took a lot of work to get to the point where a space agency could even test this technique, but it's a very brute force technique. An asteroid's coming towards you, what do you do? You swat it away, but it requires an incredible amount of precision. You are hitting a relatively tiny target moving tens of thousands of miles an hour through space with another tiny target, and you have to hit it not too hard to stop it breaking apart, because that'd be like turning a cannonball into a shotgun pellet shot. You have to hit it just right. You have to kind of know what the structure of the asteroid is like before. So, it's not a simple matter of hitting it as hard as you can, but what it has done is inaugurate Earth's ability to defend itself from these city-killer asteroids. So, I think other space agencies are going to start practicing their own method of deflecting asteroids. I think China recently announced that they're going to do just that.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nRobin, can you give us some insight into the scientists leading the charge in asteroid defense?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nThey're not what you would think of as sort of typical scientists. I mean, I argue, there are no typical scientists in a way, but if you think of the most stereotypical image of a scientist sort of thing, they're not that at all. The leader of America's planetary defense efforts was heavily inspired by Star Trek, and his sort of second in command, she went to see the premiere of Star Wars in Hollywood in 1977. So, they are the sort of kids that didn't grow up who thought, \"Hm, I want to do something really cool, something really gung-ho, sort of out there kind of science,\" but also, it just happens to be science that will make a difference to billions of people. So, they're very, very outgoing, very, very happy to chat, very, very exuberant, exhilarated about things. They just seem like they've never grown up, and as a result, we're all safer for it.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSPACECAST 2020 made predictions about space defense initiatives. Can you share a bit about the history of SPACECAST 2020, how it came about, and a few of the predictions?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nYeah, so SPACECAST 2020 was a really interesting report that was commissioned essentially by the Air Force to try and work out what sort of threats that America might face in 2020 as seen from the perspective of someone in the late '80s, early '90s. And most of these documents produced by various members of the Air Force were talking about superiority against enemy nations, satellite warfare, things like that. But Lindley Johnson, who's now America's planetary defense officer, thought, \"Well, wouldn't it be good if the Air Force could use its technology and its know-how to maybe stop asteroids crashing into the planet?\" And it kind of foresaw that there would be an urgent need to do that, because if you wait long enough, an asteroid or comet is going to hit the Earth, and wouldn't it be nice to do something about that? It took a while, but that kind of effort to save the world from asteroids actually came to fruition. It only took several decades.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nNASA is currently working on this space-based Near-Earth Object Surveyor telescope. It's designed to track asteroids and comets. The target launch date is late 2027. What technological or scientific breakthroughs do you think are crucial to achieving the goal of not only tracking, but averting collision?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nNear-Earth Surveyor is super cool. It's basically the closest we're going to have to a sort of asteroid scout, maybe even a sniper sort of thing. It's going to look in the infrared, and asteroids, like everything in space, glow in the infrared. It's like that kind of thermal imaging technology you see in a lot of films and things. And the problem with asteroids at the moment is that they are detected when sunlight reflects off them, which is good enough to kind of get a broad idea of the size and where they're going. But infrared can just see all these asteroids, even if they're illuminated by the sun's glare, if they're hidden like a match in front of a bonfire. It can immediately tell the size of the asteroid. It doesn't matter what it's made of. And basically, this is going to find almost all of the remaining city-killers in the Earth's orbit that ground-based telescopes haven't been able to find, so that's really incredible.\n\nAnd with that, at the same time, scientists are developing extra technology to help work out how to deflect or destroy these asteroids. In fact, scientists in New Mexico recently tested a way of developing sort of like a simulated nuclear explosion in a lab. It's not dangerous at all, but they've used that to kind of see if they could irradiate an asteroid to sort of knock it back, and it turns out they can. So, we're living in good times in that sense.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nYou mentioned films, and I was going to ask you about exactly that. If we were talking about a Hollywood movie, the scientists in the film would be discussing a nuclear option, and you're saying there is a real-life nuclear option being worked on here.\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nYeah. In fact, for some scenarios, as our technology is currently, a nuclear explosive device, as they're known, or NETs, are probably the best option, because they deliver the most energy in the easiest and shortest amount of time. So, say you have a city-killer coming towards Earth, if we have less than 10 years, for example, or the asteroid is way bigger than that, and we do have more time, you can't just slam a spacecraft into it and knock it off course. It might not knock it off course in time. It might be too big. In that situation, what you'd want to do is actually get a spacecraft to fly basically itself to the asteroid, not drill a hole into it, but park nearby and detonate its nuclear explosive. And what that does is it irradiates the surface of the asteroid, one surface. The surface breaks apart, it turns into like a jet of debris, and that basically turns the asteroid into a rocket, pushing the asteroid off-course, and it'll do that more emphatically than a spacecraft crashing into it.\n\nThere are obviously problems with using nuclear warheads in space. It'll cause a lot of political tension. No one wants to see anything nuclear explosive being launched into the sky, so this would be a real emergency. But in the face of doing that or doing nothing, I'm presuming some country or countries in the world would rather opt for the nuclear option. But yeah, it's a real life option. It's just difficult to test.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nPrivate companies are becoming increasingly involved in space exploration. Recently, researchers in the Netherlands said that radio waves from Elon Musk's Starlink satellites are creating a roadblock to peering into space. What are the challenges or ethical considerations here that should be top of mind for governments and private corporations?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nYeah, the problem with this proliferation of satellites, primarily like Starlink satellites, is that they reflect a lot of sunlight at sunset, twilight hours? That's when ground-based telescopes really want to point towards a kind of region of the sun to try and find these potentially dangerous asteroids that we haven't spotted yet. So, it's like there's huge graffiti streaks across the sky, and it's impacting all kind of ground-based observatories.\n\nMorally, you would hope that people that design these satellites, and it's not just Starlink satellites, it's any private company that launches them, we have to find ways to make them less reflective. Now, the technology to do that definitely exists, but it appears to me that these companies are more interested in just getting their satellites up there, worrying about the consequences later, but they're already impacting ground-based astronomy around the world. That also includes planetary defense efforts, so it seems a bit morally sketchy to me to just keep launching them without thinking about the consequences.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAsteroids aren't the only potential threats lurking in space. Are there any additional dangers scientists are equally concerned about, and how prepared are we for those?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nScientists are not as concerned about comets as they are asteroids, for one good and one bad reason. The good reason is that comets spend most of their time way far away from Earth than asteroids. Most asteroids hang about in the Mars to Jupiter region, and the ones near Earth obviously hang about a bit closer. There's just loads of more asteroids, so we have to be concerned about those. So, we don't have to be worried about comets because the chance of a comet striking Earth is very low.\n\nHowever, if one were found coming towards Earth, at this point, there's basically nothing we could do about it. They're just too big, way too fast. What's that line from Armageddon? I know it wasn't a comet, but, \"You could just fire everything you can at her and it should smile and keep on going.\" That's basically true. So at the moment, that would be a huge problem, but there's no evidence that any comet is anywhere close to heading towards us, so it's not something we should really worry about. But once they've sorted out the asteroid problem, then they'll move on to comets.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWe know at least one devastating asteroid impact has happened before. Do you think the failure to act decisively on planetary defense now will inevitably lead to history repeating itself?\n\nRobin George Andrews:\n\nOh, I hope not. See, that's the concern. I mean, the fact that something like DART, this deflection technique, is getting off the ground now, that's a good thing, but it's a matter of who's faster? It's a race against something that we don't really know about. Is there an asteroid heading towards us? Don't confidently know this yet. So, the hope is that things like Near Earth Surveyor, and there's another ground-based telescope that will find so many asteroids, called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, that's coming online next year, actually.\n\nThe hope is that we find all the dangerous space rocks if they're there before one hits us, so it's good that all this is happening, but there is obviously a chance that we could get really unlucky and a city-killer asteroid could find its way to hitting a city before we've spotted it in time. The hope is that we've acted fast enough. And I have to say, on planetary defense, humanity is being a bit more proactive than it is for most global-scale emergencies, so I'm optimistic. It's more of a feel-good story at this point.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed your book. It's called How to Kill an Asteroid.

The DART system is significantly smaller than Dimorphos, and unlike in \"Armageddon,\" the plan isn't to completely destroy it, but rather \"give it a small nudge.\"\n\nNancy Chabot, lead coordinator for DART, said giving Dimorphos a nudge will affect its orbit around Didymos by about 1%.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft slammed into the tiny asteroid Dimorphos, the impact certainly left a mark.\n\nThe intentional collision, which took place on September 26 as a test of asteroid deflection technology, displaced more than 2 million pounds (1 million kilograms) of rocks and dust from the asteroid into space. Scientists estimate it was enough material to fill about six or seven rail cars.\n\nThe insights gained from the collision are helping scientists learn how this planetary defense technique might be used in the future. That’s if an asteroid is ever discovered to be on a collision course with Earth.\n\nNeither Dimorphos, nor the larger asteroid Didymos that it orbits, pose a threat to Earth, but the system made for excellent target practice.\n\nNew findings and images from the impact were shared Thursday at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Chicago.\n\n“What we can learn from the DART mission is all part of a NASA’s overarching work to understand asteroids and other small bodies in our Solar System,” said Tom Statler, program scientist for DART at NASA, in a statement.\n\n“Impacting the asteroid was just the start. Now we use the observations to study what these bodies are made of and how they were formed — as well as how to defend our planet should there ever be an asteroid headed our way.”\n\nAstronomers captured this image of the Didymos system on November 30 using the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico. Magdalena Ridge Observatory/NM Tech\n\nImages captured by space and ground-based telescopes before and after the impact are helping scientists piece together what happened when the spacecraft crashed into Dimorphos at about 14,000 miles per hour (22,530 kilometers per hour).\n\nThe DART team calculated that the transfer of momentum when the spacecraft hit the asteroid was 3.6 times greater than if the asteroid had absorbed the spacecraft and no material was blasted from the surface. The momentum created when Dimorphos’ surface material blasted out into space contributed to moving the asteroid more than the spacecraft did, the researchers said.\n\n“Momentum transfer is one of the most important things we can measure, because it is information we would need to develop an impactor mission to divert a threating asteroid,” said Andy Cheng, DART investigation team lead from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, in a statement.\n\n“Understanding how a spacecraft impact will change an asteroid’s momentum is key to designing a mitigation strategy for a planetary defense scenario.”\n\nThe Italian CubeSat LICIACube captured these images about 3 minutes after DART's impact into Dimorphos.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft that will deliberately crash into an asteroid is getting closer to its target.\n\nThe DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, will have a rendezvous with the space rock on September 26 after launching 10 months ago.\n\nThe spacecraft will slam into an asteroid’s moon to see how it affects the motion of an asteroid in space. A live stream of images captured by the spacecraft will be available on NASA’s website beginning at 5:30 p.m. ET that day. The impact is expected to occur around 7:14 p.m. ET.\n\nThe mission is heading for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. The asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, NASA officials have said, making it a perfect target to test out a kinetic impact – which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth.\n\nThe event will be the agency’s first full-scale demonstration of deflection technology that can protect the planet.\n\n“For the first time ever, we will measurably change the orbit of a celestial body in the universe,” said Robert Braun, head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Space Exploration Sector.\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nCollision course\n\nAstronomers discovered Didymos more than two decades ago. It means “twin” in Greek, a nod to how the asteroid forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon. Didymos is nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimorphos is 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nThe spacecraft recently caught its first glimpse of Didymos using an instrument called the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation, or DRACO. It was about 20 million miles (32 million kilometers) away from the binary asteroid system when it took images in July.\n\nOn the day of impact, images taken by DRACO will not only reveal our first look at Dimorphos, but the spacecraft will use them to autonomously guide itself for an encounter with the tiny moon.\n\nDuring the event, these images will stream back to Earth at a rate of one per second, providing a “pretty stunning” look at the moon, said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and DART coordination lead at the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nThe spacecraft will accelerate at about 15,000 miles per hour (24,140 kilometers per hour) when it collides with Dimorphos.\n\nThe light from asteroid Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos is visible in a composite of 243 images taken by DRACO on July 27. NASA JPL DART Navigation Team\n\nIt aims to crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid’s motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe briefcase-size CubeSat hitched a ride with DART into space. It recently deployed from the spacecraft and is traveling behind it to record what happens.\n\nThree minutes after impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video. The video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the weeks and months following the collision.\n\nProtecting the planet\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nThe fast impact will only change Dimorphos’ speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn’t sound like a lot – but it will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nAn illustration shows NASA's DART spacecraft and the Italian Space Agency's LICIACube before the collision with Dimorphos. Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a great pyramid or something like that,” Chabot said. “But for Dimorphos, this really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption. This isn’t going to blow up the asteroid; it isn’t going to put it into lots of pieces.”\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet, Chabot said.\n\nDimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After the impact, that may change to 11 hours and 45 minutes, but follow-up observations will determine how much of a shift occurred.\n\nAstronomers will use ground-based telescopes to observe the binary asteroid system and see how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed, which will determine if DART was successful.\n\nSpace-based telescopes such as Hubble, Webb and NASA’s Lucy mission will also observe the event.\n\nIn four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will arrive to study Dimorphos, measuring physical properties of the moon, and look at the DART impact and the moon’s orbit.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/world/nasa-dart-success-update-scn", "title": "NASA: DART mission successfully changed motion of asteroid ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test successfully changed the trajectory of the asteroid Dimorphos when the NASA spacecraft intentionally slammed into the space rock on September 26, according to the agency.\n\nThe DART mission, a full-scale demonstration of deflection technology, was the world’s first conducted on behalf of planetary defense. The mission was also the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space.\n\nPrior to impact, it took Dimorphos 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit its larger parent asteroid Didymos. Astronomers used ground-based telescopes to measure how Dimorphos’ orbit changed after impact.\n\nNow, it takes Dimorphos 11 hours and 23 minutes to circle Didymos. The DART spacecraft changed the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes.\n\nInitially, astronomers expected DART to be a success if it shortened the trajectory by 10 minutes.\n\n“All of us have a responsibility to protect our home planet. After all, it’s the only one we have,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\n\n“This mission shows that NASA is trying to be ready for whatever the universe throws at us. NASA has proven we are serious as a defender of the planet. This is a watershed moment for planetary defense and all of humanity, demonstrating commitment from NASA’s exceptional team and partners from around the world.”\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of debris blasted away from the surface of Dimorphos 285 hours after impact on October 8. NASA/ESA/STScI/Hubble\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose a threat to Earth, but the double-asteroid system was a perfect target to test deflection technology, according to the DART team.\n\n“For the first time ever, humanity has changed the orbit of a planetary object,” said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA.\n\n“As new data come in each day, astronomers will be able to better assess whether, and how, a mission like DART could be used in the future to help protect Earth from a collision with an asteroid if we ever discover one headed our way.”\n\nThe DART team continues to gather data by observing the double-asteroid system, and the orbital measurement may become more precise in the future. Currently, there is an uncertainty of plus or minus two minutes.\n\nA new image of Dimorphos, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, shows that the debris trail’s cometlike tail has split into two. Scientists are still working to understand the significance of the split.\n\nThe team is now focusing on measuring how much momentum was transferred from DART to Dimorphos. At the time of impact, the spacecraft was moving at about 14,000 miles per hour (22,530 kilometers per hour). Astronomers will analyze the amount of rocks and dust blasted into space after impact.\n\nThe DART team believes that the recoil from the plume “substantially enhanced” the spacecraft’s push against the asteroid, not unlike the release of air from a balloon propels it in the opposite direction, according to NASA.\n\nThe LICIACube captured an image showing plumes of material streaming from Dimorphos asteroid after impact. The rectangles were added to enhance contrast and showcase the plumes. ASI/NASA/APL\n\n“Although we have done more to the system than simply change the orbit, we may have left Dimorphos wobbling a bit,” said Tom Statler, DART program scientist at NASA. “So over time, there may be some interaction between the wobble and the orbit and things will adjust. But it’s certainly never going to go back to the old 11 hour 55 minute orbit.”\n\nAstronomers are still investigating the surface of Dimorphos and how weak or strong it is. The DART team’s first look at Dimorphos, provided by DART before the crash, suggests that the asteroid is a pile of rubble held together by gravity.\n\nImagery continues to return from the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, or LICIACube, the mini satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency that tagged along as a robotic photojournalist on DART’s mission.\n\nIn about four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will also fly by the double-asteroid system to study the crater left by the collision and measure the mass of Dimorphos.\n\n“DART has given us some fascinating data about both asteroid properties and the effectiveness of a kinetic impactor as a planetary defense technology,” said Nancy Chabot, the DART coordination lead from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. “The DART team is continuing to work on this rich dataset to fully understand this first planetary defense test of asteroid deflection.”\n\nThe research team chose Dimorphos for this mission because its size is comparable to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. An asteroid the size of Dimorphos could cause “regional devastation” if it hit Earth.\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with an orbit that places them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) from Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nFinding populations of hazardous asteroids and determining their sizes are priorities of NASA and its international partners. The design for a space-based telescope called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission is currently in review.\n\n“We should not be too eager to say that one test on one asteroid tells us exactly how every other asteroid would behave in a similar situation,” Statler said. “But what we can do is use this test as an anchor point for our physics calculations in our simulations that tell us how different kinds of impacts in different situations should behave.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/05/planetary-annihilation-asteroid-earth/29595123/", "title": "Researchers plan for global armageddon threats", "text": "Traci Watson, Special for USA TODAY\n\nIt's no ordinary meeting when a bad decision could spell global catastrophe.\n\nFor the experts assembled at a conference hall in Italy this spring, the choices were agonizing. A gigantic space rock was bearing down on Earth. If it slammed into the planet, it could damage an area the size of Ireland. But a campaign to push the rock, known as an asteroid, off course could shatter it, possibly widening the devastation, if not done correctly,\n\nThe officials opted to shift the monster's path, and it prevented unfathomable devastation. There was just one small problem: a chunk of the asteroid broke away and made a beeline for Bangladesh.\n\nThe looming space rock was imaginary — and utterly realistic. Researchers crafted every last detail of the scenario, which was unveiled at a scientific meeting to test how the world would respond to an incoming asteroid. And it was only one of a slew of recent efforts to ensure that if a dangerous asteroid takes aim at our planet, it won't catch us unprepared.\n\nWhile it may sound like science fiction, real researchers are designing asteroid deflection tools and sketching out rocket missions to large space rocks. A pair of telescopes slated to come online by the end of 2015 will give humanity a last-minute alert of an invader headed our way. Big telescopes are already scanning the sky to give us longer warning times. Scientists and others declared June 30 the world's first \"Asteroid Day\" in hopes of raising public awareness of the threat even further.\n\nAfter decades of skepticism, \"there is real planning going on, and we're actually making progress,\" says the University of Hawaii's John Tonry, head of the late-alert telescopes. \"People are starting to realize that it's not just a totally stupid idea that an asteroid might cause big damage.\"\n\nAs if to prove the point, a space rock exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013, shattering thousands of windows and inflicting sunburns on unlucky observers. Yet the Chelyabinsk asteroid, at 55 to 65 feet, was a trifle. More than 600,000 asteroids that swing close to Earth are 150 feet wide or bigger — big enough to destroy New York City in a direct hit.\n\nScientists are trying to ensure nothing sneaks up on us. Observatories in Hawaii and Arizona, among others, sniff out large asteroids on a dangerous trajectory. Tonry's telescopes will give a week's warning for a swimming pool-sized rock on its \"final death plunge,\" he says, and will also will spot asteroids far in advance of their passage close to Earth.\n\nIf something big does come this way, researchers are working on the \"death ray\" technique, as it was dubbed on Twitter. Still in early testing, it would send a spaceship to aim powerful lasers at an asteroid's surface. The jet of vaporized debris would propel the rock out of its original path.\n\n\"You don't carry the propellant to the asteroid. … We use the asteroid itself as fuel,\" says designer University of California, Santa Barbara physicist Philip Lubin.\n\nThere's also the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, which would carry a nuclear bomb to shatter the asteroid into harmless bits. Researchers have calculated that, in theory, a rocket now commercially available could ferry the proposed spacecraft to an asteroid while it was still a good distance from Earth, even with only a few hours' warning.\n\n\"We're preparing ourselves in case we don't want to take the hit,\" says NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Brent Barbee, who helped analyze the vehicle's abilities. \"We've checked that box.\"\n\nNudging asteroids off course would be less spectacular but possibly just as effective, at least if there's plenty of warning. For this \"kinetic impactor\" method, a massive spaceship slams into the asteroid's surface at more than 20,000 mph, pushing the rock onto a new path through the solar system. A spaceship that's too small or too slow would botch the job, so researchers have been laboring to predict how a collision affects rocks of different shapes and compositions.\n\nThey've learned, for example, that compared to a solid asteroid, a fluffy one will demand a harder hit from either a bigger spacecraft or several smaller ones. It's also becoming clear that whacking a smallish asteroid with too much force could break it into a flying debris field that might be more dangerous than the original body.\n\n\"We have made definite progress … and have narrowed down the possibilities of what would happen,\" says University of Washington planetary scientist Keith Holsapple. The recent research \"gives us a much better idea of what we can do, what our limits are.\"\n\nRecent analysis has given us \"a bit of a head start,\" agrees Mark Boslough of Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. \"If we were going to make it up from scratch, it would take more time.\"\n\nLuckily these rocks, though numerous, don't dive to Earth often. An object that could obliterate a city hits Earth, on average, only once every 500 years or so, Boslough says. Most such outer-space visitors will plummet into the sea or empty land. But given the damage one could cause, it's worth planning for, researchers say.\n\n\"This is probably the greatest natural disaster that is potentially preventable by our actions,\" says Paul Miller of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. \"If we were unlucky enough (to face) a very large object, it's a very serious matter, and you want to get it right.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/16/apophis-asteroid-2029-earth-flyby/74702620007/", "title": "Asteroid Apophis to pass near Earth in 2029: What to know", "text": "Apophis is projected to pass within 20,000 miles of our planet’s surface on April 13 2029. The menacing asteroid will harmlessly pass by, astronomers say.\n\nApophis measures nearly a quarter of a mile long – about the size of a cruise ship – making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye when it shoots past Earth.\n\nSpace agencies and scientific institutes around the world are planning to use the rare flyby to explore Apophis from the ground with telescopes and even spacecraft.\n\nAmong astronomers both professional and amateur, perhaps no asteroid is more notorious than Apophis.\n\nIf you've heard of Apophis, then you're likely aware of the reputation it gained upon its discovery two decades ago as a potentially very dangerous space rock hurtling too close for comfort toward Earth. It was initially believed that the asteroid could one day pose a serious threat to our planet.\n\nAnd one day, it just might.\n\nBut that day won't come for at least 100 years, astronomers say. No, not even in 2029, when Apophis makes the closest approach to Earth that any asteroid of its size ever has – at least, one that scientists have known about in advance.\n\nAdditional observations of Apophis have allowed astronomers to long rule out the risk of an impact in 2029 when Apophis is predicted to come within a distance of Earth 10 times closer than the moon, according to NASA. The asteroid also won't hit our planet when it makes another close approach in 2036.\n\nWhile we and our children are safe from Apophis' wrath, scientists still see a valuable opportunity to study the asteroid as it whizzes by Earth to learn what they can of other space rocks that actually could hit our planet.\n\nHere's what to know about Apophis and how space agencies hope to protect Earth from other asteroids like it.\n\nApophis to make 2029 flyby to Earth\n\nApophis is projected to pass within 20,000 miles of our planet’s surface on April 13, 2029.\n\nFor the superstitious lot, yes, that's a Friday, no less.\n\nOn that day, Apophis will come closer than telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbit, the ESA says.\n\nThe close encounter with Earth will make the asteroid visible in the Eastern hemisphere, including in Europe, Africa, and western Asia. It should look somewhat like a bright star streaking across the sky.\n\nEarth's gravity will significantly influence Apophis – squeezing and distorting the asteroid as one side is pulled toward our planet more than the other. While no affects will be felt on Earth, Apophis may experience some quakes and even landslides, the ESA said.\n\nWill Apophis hit earth?\n\nIn short, no. Not during our lifetimes, anyway.\n\nWhile Apophis is classified as a near-Earth asteroid because its orbit bring it within 30 million miles of Earth, you have nothing to fear from it.\n\nApophis was initially identified as one of the most hazardous asteroids that could impact Earth after its 2004 discovery, but that assessment has since changed as astronomers tracked it and learned more about its orbit.\n\nWhile the risk of it impacting Earth during its 2029 flyby rose as high as 2.7%, Apophis has since been removed from NASA’s Sentry Impact Risk Table. That's thanks to a radar observation campaign in March 2021 during a distant flyby that – combined with precise orbit analysis – allowed astronomers to determine that the asteroid poses no risk of crashing into Earth for at least a century.\n\nHow big is the Apophis asteroid?\n\nApophis measures nearly a quarter of a mile long – about the size of a cruise ship – making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye when it shoots past Earth.\n\nThe Planetary Society compares its size to the equivalent of about five football fields and taller than the Empire State Building in New York City.\n\nIt's hard to know just exactly what Apophis looks like, as scientists do not yet have images of it. But radar observations have suggested that Apophis is shaped roughly like a peanut – a relatively common shape among near-Earth asteroids larger than 660 feet in diameter, according to NASA.\n\nApophis is believed to be stony, made up of silicate (or rocky) materials and a mixture of metallic nickel and iron.\n\nWhat would happen if Apophis hit Earth?\n\nThough not as big or catastrophic as the asteroid theorized to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Apophis would cause widespread destruction up to several hundred kilometers from its impact site.\n\nThe energy released would be equal more than 1,000 megatons of TNT, or tens to hundreds of nuclear weapons, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization promoting space exploration.\n\nWhat does 'Apophis' mean?\n\nApophis is no different from other asteroids in that it is a remnant from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. It originated in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and spent millions of years being altered by the gravitational influence of large planets such as Jupiter, NASA said.\n\nNow, Apophis's orbit around the sun brings it startlingly close to Earth.\n\nIt's partly due to its proximity, as well as the sheer devastation its impact with Earth would bring, that astronomers named the asteroid after an ancient Egyptian god of disorder.\n\nSpecifically, Apophis is named for the demon serpent who personified evil and chaos.\n\nESA, NASA hope to study Apophis\n\nSpace agencies and scientific institutes around the world are planning to use the rare flyby to explore Apophis from the ground with telescopes and even spacecraft.\n\nNASA's OSIRIS-REx, which gathered and returned a sample of asteroid Bennu in September, has been renamed OSIRIS-APophis EXplorer (OSIRIS-APEX) and sent on a trajectory that would allow it to cross paths with the asteroid in 2029. When it has its rendezvous with Apophis in June that year, OSIRIS-APEX will spend 18 months mapping the asteroid’s surface and analyzing its chemical makeup, according to NASA.\n\nEarth-based telescopes will observe Apophis as well, but they won't be able to detect as much as the spacecraft will when the asteroid gets near the sun, NASA said. But unlike with the Bennu mission, OSIRIS-APEX will not collect a sample from Apophis.\n\nThe European Space Agency, NASA's counterpart across the pond, plans to launch a spacecraft of its own called Ramses.\n\nThe Ramses spacecraft, which must be ready to launch a year ahead of time, will meet Apophis before it passes by Earth and accompany it on its way out of our orbit. During that time, the mission will observe how the surface of the asteroid changes from being in such close proximity to Earth, the European Space Agency said in July.\n\nNASA takes on dangerous asteroids\n\nThe expedition is all part of the steps NASA and other space agencies have taken in recent years to protect humanity from threats posed by asteroids and other inbound space rocks, such as comets.\n\nIn September 2022, NASA intentionally slammed a spacecraft into the small asteroid Dimorphos at roughly 14,000 mph.\n\nThough Dimorphos posed no threat to Earth, the mission served as the first demonstration of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART. If an incoming asteroid is ever on a collision course with our planet, the space agency has said that the DART method could prove crucial for deflecting and changing the object's orbital path.\n\nAnd to gauge whether authorities are prepared to defend Earth from space objects, NASA has hosted a series of exercises, the fifth and most recent of which occurred in April, with findings announced in June. It was the first such exercise to include about 100 international government representatives who gathered to work through a hypothetical scenario about an inbound asteroid.\n\nThe exercise was organized by the U.S. space agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, which was established in 2016 to catalog near-Earth objects that could crash into the planet.\n\nNASA is also working on an asteroid-hunting telescope known as the NEO Surveyor to find near-Earth objects capable of causing significant damage. Set to launch no earlier than June 2028, the telescope is designed to discover 90% of asteroids and comets that are 460 feet in size or larger and come within 30 million miles of Earth’s orbit.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope captured a new snapshot of the asteroid that NASA recently slammed with a spacecraft in an attempt to knock it off course, and the image reveals the clearest look yet at some unexpected results from the mission — a twin tail of dust trailing behind the asteroid system.\n\nThe image, released Thursday, is one of 18 observations that the Hubble telescope has made of the Didymos-Dimorphos asteroid system since NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, mission crashed a probe into Dimorphos in September.\n\n“Repeated observations from Hubble over the last several weeks have allowed scientists to present a more complete picture of how the system’s debris cloud has evolved over time,” according to a statement from NASA and the European Space Agency, which jointly operate Hubble.\n\n“The observations show that the ejected material, or ‘ejecta,’ has expanded and faded in brightness as time went on after impact, largely as expected,” the statement reads. “The twin tail is an unexpected development, although similar behavior is commonly seen in comets and active asteroids. The Hubble observations provide the best-quality image of the double-tail to date.”\n\nScientists are working to understand the significance of the split tail. NASA noted that it’s the northernmost tail that was newly created, and scientists will use data from Hubble in the coming months to examine more closely how it may have formed.\n\nDimorphos, the target of NASA’s DART mission, is a smaller asteroid that orbits around the larger Didymos. Astronomers anticipated that the mission could be deemed a success if the impact from the DART spacecraft could shorten Dimorphos’ orbit by 10 seconds. But NASA revealed this month that it was able to cut its trajectory down by 32 minutes — from an orbit of 11 hours and 55 minutes to 11 hours and 23 minutes.\n\nThe DART mission was the world’s first conducted on behalf of planetary defense, with the goal of testing technology that could one day be used to deflect an asteroid headed for Earth.

Even at 12-24 hours, NHC's track forecasts can be off by an average of 20-30 nautical miles. Since storm surge forecasts are highly sensitive to the exact track, this means that the realized storm surge heights across the Tampa Bay region and south may vary widely, and there will likely be a noticeable gradient of surge heights to the north of the landfall location. However, the risk of devastating storm surge still exists across much of the west-central and southwest coast of Florida given the size of the storm and the uncertainties in exactly where landfall will occur.\"\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 145 mph with higher gusts.\n\nMilton is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Milton is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida tonight, and remain at hurricane strength while it moves across the Florida peninsula through Thursday.\n\nGradual weakening is forecast while Milton moves eastward over the western Atlantic, and it is likely to become an extratropical storm by early Friday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles.

Customers can check their airline’s website for specific details on travel advisories., USA TODAY reported.\n\nUnder Department of Transportation rules, anyone whose flight was canceled is eligible for a refund. However, they aren't entitled to any compensation for delays due to the storm since weather is outside airline control, according to USA TODAY.\n\nSharks leave Southwest Florida waters as Hurricane Milton approaches\n\nAccording to shark tracking app Shark Tracker, sharks have cleared out of the western coast of Florida, taking themselves out of the direct path of Hurricane Milton, which is projected to make landfall somewhere around the mid-point of the state’s Gulf coast.\n\nThis is not the first time this has happened.\n\nTagged sharks from Sarasota south to San Carlos Bay left the Southwest Florida coast about 24 hours before Hurricane Charley made landfall in 2004, coinciding with a sharp drop in air pressure. The data showed that the same sharks returned about 24 hours after Charley hit.\n\nYears earlier, data shows all tagged sharks in Terra Ceia Bay fled Tropica Storm Gabrielle when the storm hit Southwest Florida in 2001, heading for deeper waters.\n\nAs air pressure decreases, water pressure also drops, and may lead sharks to feel as though the water itself has gotten shallower, scientists have postulated.\n\n– Kate Cimini\n\nTornado crossing I-75 ahead of Hurricane Milton\n\nA tornado crossed I-75 on Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Miami reported on X at 10:08 a.m.\n\nHurricane Milton Wednesday view from space\n\nNASA astronaut and U.S. Navy Commander Matthew Dominick shared a timelapse video on X shot from a window of the Crew Dragon Endeavor space capsule flying over Hurricane Milton Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We flew over Hurricane Milton again today about an hour ago.

This is often called the “dirty side” of a hurricane and is on the right side, in Milton's case the east side, of a hurricane.\n\nWhat other storms are in the tropics now?\n\nHere is the latest from the National Hurricane Center on systems that may develop other than Hurricane Milton:\n\nInvest 93L, in the southwestern Atlantic: Showers and thunderstorms associated with a gale-force non-tropicallow pressure system located about 375 miles west-southwest of Bermuda have become less organized during the last several hours.\n\nAlthough environmental conditions are becoming less favorable for development, a short-lived tropical or subtropical storm could still form today or this evening while the low moves northeastward to east-northeastward at around 15 mph.

Watches, warnings issued for Florida as of 5 a.m. include.\n\nHurricane warning:\n\nFlorida west coast from Bonita Beach northward to Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay\n\nFlorida east coast from the St. Lucie/Martin County Line northward to Ponte Vedra Beach\n\nHurricane watch:\n\nLake Okeechobee\n\nFlorida west coast from Chokoloskee to south of Bonita Beach\n\nFlorida east coast north of Ponte Vedra Beach to the mouth of the St. Marys River\n\nFlorida east coast from the St. Lucie/Martin County Line to the Palm Beach/Martin County Line\n\nStorm surge warning:\n\nFlorida west coast from Flamingo northward to Yankeetown, including Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay\n\nSebastian Inlet Florida to Altamaha Sound Georgia, including the St. Johns River\n\nTropical storm warning:\n\nFlorida Keys, including Dry Tortugas and Florida Bay\n\nLake Okeechobee\n\nFlorida west coast from Flamingo to south of Bonita Beach\n\nFlorida west coast from north of Suwanee River to Indian Pass\n\nFlorida east coast south of the St. Lucie/Martin County Line to Flamingo\n\nNorth of Ponte Vedra Beach Florida to the Savannah River\n\nStorm surge impacts will be devastating, life threatening\n\nIn any tropical storm or hurricane, the biggest danger is not the wind. It's the water.\n\nStorm surge, the massive wall of relentless water that pushes ashore during a hurricane and up into rivers and bays, often causes the most damage and the most deaths. The battering force of a sudden rise of water can easily destroy bridges, erode roads and knock homes off their foundations.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that when Hurricane Milton approaches, most of Florida's west coast could see storm surge up to 15 feet above ground level during high tide.\n\nPreparations should be rushed to completion, with conditions expected to steadily deteriorate across Florida throughout the day ahead of this \"once-in-a-lifetime\" storm arrives.\n\n\"Milton will be a surge event unlike any hurricane in living memory for west-central Florida, with only major hurricane strikes in 1848 and 1921 comparable in scope and height of the coastal flooding,\" said Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist with WeatherTiger. Truchelut is a Florida meteorologist who works with the USA TODAY Network.\n\nCurrent evacuation zones in Florida. Know your flood zone\n\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management has a website to determine whether you live in an evacuation zone and what zone it is.\n\nGo to the website and enter your address. If your home is in one of the colored areas, those are flood zones where you may be asked to evacuate by local officials.\n\nTypically, Zone A is the most vulnerable and the most likely to be asked to evacuate first. Zone F is most likely to evacuate last.\n\nIn an evacuation zone? Here are Florida traffic maps and cameras.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis says there’s still much uncertainty about Hurricane Milton, but the state is preparing to open highway shoulders for mass evacuations to come.\n\nIndividual counties make evacuation calls. “Once those orders come down from all the counties, I think it’s going to be a significant number of people,” DeSantis said.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation is monitoring traffic, and as soon as travel speeds are down to 40 mph, the state will begin to open shoulders for travel to relieve congestion, according to state Transportation Secretary Jared Perdue.\n\n— Cheryl McCloud\n\nWhich counties in Florida are in a state of emergency?\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 54 Florida counties ahead of Hurricane Milton, which could bring major hurricane winds and flooding to already-heavily damaged Gulf Coast communities and beyond. The Florida counties included in the emergency declaration extend across the peninsula. They are:\n\nAlachua, Baker, Bradford, Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, DeSoto, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Gilchrist, Glades, Hamilton, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Levy, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Nassau, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, St. Lucie Sumter, Suwanee, Taylor, Union, and Volusia.\n\nIs there school today in Florida? Districts closed ahead of Hurricane Milton\n\nHurricane Milton has forced 49 school districts to close across Florida on Wednesday.\n\nNine schools were closed Monday and more have plans to be closed through Thursday. Here's a list of Florida schools closed today from the state.\n\nStorm radar Florida\n\nLatest spaghetti models for Hurricane Milton\n\nStay informed.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/us/r-kelly-sentencing-racketeering-sex-trafficking", "title": "R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday. The session had been scheduled for Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe Dakin Andone", "Sonia Moghe", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/things-to-do/2024/11/21/where-to-find-christmas-light-displays-in-rhode-island-2024-roger-williams-park-zoo-gillette-stadium/76193110007/", "title": "RI Christmas Lights: Drive through, walk through lights in and ...", "text": "The weather is getting colder and the days are getting shorter, which means it's time for a beloved holiday tradition sure to brighten up anyone's day - Christmas lights.\n\nTo experience the dazzling lights of the holiday season, you don't have to go far.

Is \"The Golden Bachelor\" finally the answer to the genre's problems?\n\nFrom \"Love Is Blind\" to \"The Bachelor,\" the genre faces issues from racism to fatphobia to ableism, and yet viewers can't seem to get enough. Reality dating shows are the crème de la crème for problematic consumers.\n\nWatchers of reality TV dating shows know there is a problem: They tweet about it every week, and petition for change. But we're still tuning in to the fantasy.\n\nWe go to \"Love Island\" for cheeky television and binge-watching, \"The Courtship\" while waiting for the next season of \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Married At First Sight\" to escape dating apps. There's so much to choose from, but we've watched them all so you don't have to.\n\nWe've ranked all the reality dating shows, from worst to best.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n18. 'The Courtship' (NBC)\n\n\"The Courtship\" follows Nicole Rémy on her quest for love. Setting this apart from \"The Bachelorette,\" the show takes place in the English countryside, as everyone dresses and acts straight out of \"Bridgerton\" – an attempt to leave modern dating in the past. The show also wasn't loved by NBC viewers: It was canceled after two weeks, moved to USA Network and streaming on Peacock.\n\nWhy we love it: \"The Courtship\" is whimsical, fun and unique as far as new dating shows go. And while it's not meant to be funny, some of the dates are pure comedy.\n\nWhy we hate it: The show doesn't allow contestants to truly be themselves when they're in the fake Regency era. It also frames concepts of chivalry and gentlemanliness as something one person can't achieve while dating in the 21st century – which is only true if you believe that.\n\nSeason 1 now streaming on Peacock.\n\n17. 'Sexy Beasts' (Netflix)\n\n\"Sexy Beasts\" is a bizarre show that aims to tackle superficial dating by having contestants use animal prosthetics and costumes to hide their appearance, and have their personality be the key to finding love. Think \"The Masked Singer,\" but for dating.\n\nWhy we love it: The concept of finding love based on personality alone is appealing. It also reminds us of the movie \"Halloweentown\" and the approaching spooky season.\n\nWhy we hate it: It's hard to take the show seriously, as you're distracted from getting to know the contestants when all you can focus on is their physical appearance – the irony.\n\nSeasons 1 and 2 now streaming.\n\n16. '5 Guys a Week' (Lifetime)\n\n\"5 Guys a Week,\" a UK series, features a single woman who invites five men to live in her house for a week in the hopes of finding love. Throughout the week, she eliminates men until she finds her dream guy.\n\nWhy we love it: If you don't have the patience or time to watch a full season of \"The Bachelor,\" \"5 Guys a Week\" is a condensed version with self-contained episodes, each with a new lead. There's also a wider age range of contestants, including some in their 60s, that are underrepresented in dating shows.\n\nWhy we hate it: It's a bit boring.\n\nSeason 1 now streaming.\n\n15. 'The Bachelor' (ABC)\n\n\"The Bachelor\" is an ABC staple of 20 years in which one man looks for love among 25 or so women. The lead dates each contestant in group and individual settings. Each week, he hands out roses to those who will stay on his quest for love, until he proposes at the end of the season.\n\nWhy we love it: \"The Bachelor\" is the longest-running dating show, and it laid the foundation for other shows to come.\n\nWhy we hate it: The lack of diversity among the leads and the contestants, from race to body type, makes it bland. The show also has a tendency to pit women against each other, feasting on the drama from their conflicts rather than the lead. (To be fair, the lead is usually boring.)\n\nSeasons 14-16, 20, 22-23 now streaming on Hulu.\n\n14. 'Cosmic Love' (Amazon Prime)\n\nIs love really all in the stars? \"Cosmic Love\" aims to find out. This new Amazon Prime series follows four contestants from each of the four elements: air, water, fire and earth. Noel Allen (Pisces), Phoebe Davis (Leo), Connor Shennan (Gemini) and Maria Rodriguez (Capricorn) meet 16 contestants throughout the season to discover their astrological match determined by the AstroTwins Ophira and Tali Edut.\n\nWhy we love it: \"Cosmic Love\" is made for people who lead their dating bios with their zodiac sign, watch \"Love Island\" and miss \"Are You the One?\" It's fun and flirty, while still having the drama that gets people talking online.\n\nWhy we hate it: The show would have been perfect for including queer people, but alas, they are all seeking straight relationships. Also, if you're not into astrology, you'll hate the premise.\n\nSeason 1 now streaming.\n\n13. 'Back in the Groove' (Hulu)\n\n\"Back in the Groove\" caters to a group of women in their early 40s who \"don't need a man, but want a man,\" host Taye Diggs playfully introduces. The show is a spin on 1998 rom-com \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back,\" which starred Diggs. Over the course of the series, three lead contestants date a batch of younger men ranging from their early 20s to early 30s.\n\nWhy we love it: There are very few reality dating shows that cater to this age demographic. The show also frames the accomplishments of the women, rather than feeding into cougar stereotypes. The cast also has the most racial diversity I've seen in this genre.\n\nWhy we hate it: The leading ladies are stunning, athletic and overall conventionally attractive. That in itself is not a problem, had the show not been based on age gap relationships. It almost seems as though they were cast to meet the gaze of younger men.\n\nSeason 1 now streaming.\n\n12. 'The Ultimatum' (Netflix)\n\nFor couples hitting the fork in the road of their relationship, \"The Ultimatum\" features couples with one partner who's decided they want to get married or break up. The twist is that all the couples break up and have the opportunity to date each other's partners before choosing to get engaged, split or even date a new person they've coupled with.\n\nWhy we love it: \"The Ultimatum\" is very messy, which is great for reality TV.\n\nWhy we hate it: The show acknowledges that studies say giving an ultimatum is not good for relationships. People who go on the show might as well break up if they have to date other people to decide whether they want to be together forever.\n\nSeason 1 and 2 now streaming.\n\n11. 'Love Island USA' (Peacock)\n\n\"Love Island USA\" has male and female contestants alternate deciding which \"islander\" they want to couple with. Throughout the season, new islanders are brought in, disruptingrelationships that form. Through voting, viewers decide who is up for elimination.\n\nWhy we love it: The show has 40-plus episodes, making it the perfect binge-watch for days off. It's mostly fun and games for hot folks without much substance. If you miss a few episodes, it's OK.\n\nWhy we hate it: The U.S. version of \"Love Island,\" which aired its first two seasons on CBS, is less raunchy and more filtered than its predecessor in the U.K.\n\nSeasons 1-5 now streaming on Peacock, limited seasons streaming on Netflix, Hulu and Prime Video.\n\n10. 'Too Hot To Handle' (Netflix)\n\nHorny singles venture to Mexico for a show they believe is dubbed \"Pleasure Island,\" only to be tricked into \"Too Hot to Handle.\" After 12 hours, contestants learn from their host/robot Lana that in order to win the $100,000 prize, they must abstain from kissing or sexual contact of any kind. The prize fund decreases each time the rule is broken, although they are awarded sexual contact when couples make meaningful connections.\n\nWhy we love it: It's ridiculous watching people throw away money just to have sex during such a short stay. The show gets interesting as rules are broken and people turn on each other – the classic reality TV formula.\n\nWhy we hate it: \"Too Hot to Handle\" is the last place people with potential sex addiction should be. As the seasons go on, it's also clear it is a reality TV-to-Instagram fame pipeline more than a dating show.\n\nSeasons 1-5 now streaming.\n\n9. 'The Bachelorette' (ABC)\n\n\"The Bachelorette\" is a gender flip, with the lead chosen from the pool of women who competed on the previous season of \"The Bachelor.\"\n\nWhy we love it: The women tend to be more interesting, less tolerant of contestants playing games and seemingly more serious about finding love. There hasn't been a lead we weren't rooting for.\n\nWhy we hate it: Men still have control in \"The Bachelorette,\" with the expectation that the winner will propose. In a bid to support formerly brokenhearted finalists Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia from Clayton Echard's season of \"The Bachelor,\" both women were chosen as leads for Season 19. The goal was to put power back into their hands, but so far it's only caused a mess, as the male contestants took back power as they pitted the women against each other.\n\nSeasons 8, 10-13 and 18 now streaming on Hulu.\n\n8. 'Are You the One?' (MTV)\n\nWe love a social-experiment game show. For \"Are You the One?,\" contestants are matched by experts, but not told who they're compatible with. Over the course of 10 episodes, their \"perfect match\" is determined through a series of games, dates, strategies and a weekly matchup ceremony. If they all match the correct couples, there's a prize fund of up to $1 million.\n\nWhy we love it: Season 8 features an all-queer cast and is perhaps the best season of reality TV dating. It really challenged the contestants and normalized relationships between people with varying sexual orientations and gender identities. That season aside, it's interesting to see how people grapple with the fact that the person they like may not be their \"perfect match.\"\n\nWhy we hate it: There's a lot of partying going on in place of what could be more opportunities for people to uncover whether they are each other's perfect match.\n\nSeasons 1, 2, 4, 6-9 now streaming on Paramount+, limited seasons now streaming on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n7. 'Love Is Blind' (Netflix)\n\nThe premise of \"Love Is Blind\" is finding love before knowing someone's physical appearance. Men and women are separated into different pods where they have to decide through conversations to become engaged before ever meeting face to face. Once engaged, they venture into real-world experiences to determine if they want to stay together.\n\nWhy we love it: The concept of finding love by bonding with someone's heart challenges people at a time when dating is largely decided by looks – especially with all the options available on dating apps.\n\nWhy we hate it: The show attempts to mimic \"Married At First Sight,\" but fails because contestants still find ways to determine what their partner looks like. Overall, there is a lack of body diversity. Vanessa Lachey put the onus on contestants in an interview with Insider published in July, suggesting the lack of body diversity is because people may be \"insecure\" if they don't fall into a certain body mold, which prevents them from making strong connections.\n\nThere are also other marriages that don't make the final edit. If they made the seasons longer or the dating pool smaller, everyone's love story could be seen.\n\nSeasons 1-5 now streaming.\n\n6. 'Bachelor in Paradise' (ABC)\n\n\"Bachelor in Paradise\" is the romantically successful spinoff of \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\" franchise, bringing contestants who didn't find love to an island to make connections. Every other week, men and women alternate giving out roses to determine who stays and who goes.\n\nWhy we love it:More couples stay together and get married on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" than the main ABC franchises. As of August, 11 \"Paradise\" couples remain together, which is more than \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\" combined. It is a more realistic scenario that allows contestants to date multiple people. And we love a good love triangle.\n\nWhy we hate it: Some contestants go on the show hoping for a specific person to appear, which raises the question of why they don't just reach out outside of the show. Remember when Pieper James and Brendan Morais went on Season 7 as singles even though they were a couple?\n\nSeasons 1-5 and 9 now streaming on Hulu. Season 9 airs on ABC Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT.\n\n5. 'Indian Matchmaking' (Netflix)\n\n\"Indian Matchmaking\" host Sima Taparia is dubbed Mumbai's top matchmaker, and she brought her efforts to reality TV. The Netflix series explores the lives of people of Indian descent, matched by Taparia based on preference, family values and traditional practices with marriage as the goal.\n\nWhy we love it: \"Indian Matchmaking\" isn't perfect, but that honesty is a part of the charm of the show. True to real life, the singles grapple with tradition, family pressure and dating as a divorcee.\n\nWhy we hate it: The show glosses over the Indian caste system, and how arranged marriages help maintain it. There are also only Hindu castmembers, excluding Indians who identify as Muslim, Christian or Dali.\n\nSeasons 1-3 now streaming.\n\n4. 'Love Island UK' (Hulu)\n\nThe original U.K. version of \"Love Island\" brings in contestants from all over Europe to compete to be the top couple. The winning couple gets to split £50K for finding love.\n\nWhy we love it: The banter!Maybe it's because we're American and love to hear accents, but the contestants seem to have wittier and more playful conversations than in the U.S. version. Contestants are also not afraid to stir the pot, which makes it more entertaining.\n\nWhy we hate it: This is a problematic favorite. \"Love Island\" continues to lead with complaints brought to U.K. media regulator Ofcom, largely relating to misogyny. The show has also had fewer people of color as contestants, and many get sent home early or are solely relegated to same-race relationships.\n\nSeasons 1-10 now streaming on Hulu.\n\n2. 'Married At First Sight' (Lifetime)\n\nThree dating experts match five or more couples in the same city and have them meet at the altar. They have no information about one another before they say \"I do.\" After eight weeks, the couples must decide whether they want to stay married.\n\nWhy we love it: Getting married to a stranger is a bit extreme, but the show sets up couples for success by confronting obstacles they'd face in the real world, and include therapy – a resource not all real-world couples can afford.\n\nWhy we hate it: This is far less salacious than other reality TV dating shows, so some episodes can drag.\n\nSeasons 1-17 now streaming on Lifetime.com. Season 17 airs on Lifetime on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT. Various seasons streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu.\n\nWhat people with autism wish you knew: 'We want to be understood, not hidden away'\n\n2. 'Love on the Spectrum' (Netflix)\n\n\"Love on the Spectrum\" follows seven adults on the autism spectrum who are actively dating. Each of the singles embarks on a quest for love through matchmaking, speed dating or online dating. The series began in Australia before a U.S. version premiered in May.\n\nWhy we love it: The authenticity of the show allows people to see a different side of those with autism in a way that is not infantilized or patronizing. Everyone can relate to love. There is also a lot to learn in terms of honesty within relationships.\n\nWhy we hate it: The seasons are only five episodes, and there's no reunion show to follow up on the love stories. It's also been over a year since the last season. We want more!\n\nSeason 1 (US); Seasons 1 and 2 (Australia) now streaming\n\n1. 'The Golden Bachelor'\n\nIn a \"Bachelor\" franchise first, ABC has cast a senior citizen to lead the show. Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old widow and retired restaurateur from Indiana is on the quest to find his second soulmate in life.\n\nWhy we love it: Finally. \"The Bachelor\" answered most of its problems by casting an older gentleman and women contestants between the ages of 60 and 75. The new series shows the realities of dating when people are secure in life and focused on true love over Instagram followers. There's also body, race, disability and background diversity.\n\nWhy we hate it: The season hasn't ended so only time will tell, but so far, it's golden!\n\nSeason 1 now streaming on Hulu and airing on ABC on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n'Love is Blind' Season 5 reunion: Who's together, who tried again after the pods", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/media/game-of-thrones-house-of-the-dragon-ratings", "title": "'House of the Dragon' catches fire with big finale viewership | CNN ...", "text": "1.

The jury is out, but while we figure it out, we can watch straight-faced skeptic Shane Madej and ghoul-believer Ryan Bergara travel to locations long-rumored to be plagued by ghosts, as they investigate with various ghost-hunting tools and tech. From the Winchester Mansion and Eastern State Penitentiary to La Llorona Park and the Whaley House, the Ghoul Boys have seen it all.\n\nThe show is less focused on hauntings themselves and more on the banter between an unmoving skeptic and a jumpy believer. In the era of kitschy dramatic reenactments and incredibly fake-looking evidence on ghost-hunting shows, this online series is a breath of fresh air.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWarnings: Occasional (beeped) language and some spooky atmosphere, but nothing too intense.\n\n2. Safiya Nygaard\n\nSafiya Nygaard is a vlogger of many hats. Whether she’s buying clothes blindfolded, testing out electronics from cheap-to-buy sites like Wish, trying ridiculous designer trends, putting together outfits based on different decades or buying every lipstick at Sephora and melting them together to see what the median color is, Safiya’s experiments make for addictive and fun episodes — and that barely scratches the surface!\n\nCheck out her video below from her Decades in Fashion series, where she put together looks based on a single year of fashion history.\n\nEntertainment on YouTube: COVID-19 forces comedian to take tour to YouTube\n\nWarnings: None. Just bad makeup science and questionable fashion choices to be found here.\n\n3. Bon Appétit\n\nClaire Saffitz, a pastry chef in the Bon Appetit Test Kitchen, can be described by commenters as a meticulous perfectionist. So how does this work out when she needs to recreate and elevate recipes for our favorite snacks (like Takis, Kit-Kat bars, Starburst and Cheetos)? Usually with much difficulty, but incredible results.\n\nDon’t be surprised if you binge all of her Gourmet Makes videos in a matter of days. The good news is that once you finish those, you can move on to the other series the channel has to offer, such as Brad Leone’s fantastically and comedically edited show It’s Alive, where he works with livestock, cultures, fermentations, and other “living” forms of cooking.\n\nWarnings: Occasional (beeped) language when Claire gets frustrated. It’s understandable — you try making a Gusher from scratch.\n\n4. Kiwami Japan\n\nLook. Knives are objectively pretty cool, right? While knife making usually brings to mind imagery of forges, hot fires and red-hot molten steel, that’s definitely not the only way they can be made.\n\nKiwami Japan is the English name of a Japanese youtuber who specializes in making knives out of… unconventional materials. Think conch shells, potatoes, jello and cardboard. The best part is all these knives are functional. He doesn’t speak in these videos, and the measurements and steps (or at least the ingredients used) are typically shown in English, so they’re pretty accessible.\n\nWarnings: None. Videos are a bit strange, but definitely not inappropriate\n\n5. The Drawfee Channel\n\nThe Drawfee Channel features four illustrators and animators — Nathan Yaffe, Jacob Andrews, Julia Lepetit and Karina Farek as they draw out a series of prompts, challenges and stories. The videos are short enough to enjoy over a cup of coffee, and fun enough to binge.\n\nWhile a lot of the prompts revolve around popular anime and video games, not all of them do, and the artists sometimes dedicate an episode to challenging themselves with new styles, unique color schemes or trying out a digital art brush they haven't tried before.\n\nWarnings: Episodes feature occasional toilet humor, but nothing too blue\n\n6. MadeYewLook\n\nMakeup isn’t confined to just cat-eyeliner and cut creases, and face painting isn’t just butterflies at the state fair. MadeYewLook, led by Alexys “Lex” Fleming, features incredible character transformations with body paint, SFX makeup techniques, and sometimes even just plain eyeshadow.\n\nLex, the self taught body painter and makeup artist, has videos dating back 7 years, so there is no end in sight if you want to binge her tutorials.\n\nWarnings: Some designs are horror-themed and might feature (painted) gory/body-horror details\n\n7.

Their population has been threatened by bycatch from commercial fishing operations.\n\nJekyll Island was a particular hot spot for sea turtle nests this nesting season: There were 236 sea turtle nests recorded on the island, the highest ever recorded, the news release explained. And more than 6,000 baby loggerheads have hatched from those nests.\n\nThe high number of nests reflects Georgia’s ongoing conservation successes. The nesting loggerhead sea turtle population in Georgia has increased by around 4% each year since the 90s, says the Georgia Sea Turtle Center. All five species of sea turtles found in the waters along the state are protected by state and federal law, says the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.

The birds have become a problem for restaurants and other businesses, as well as a noise nuisance for the residential areas.\n\nWhen it comes to eating outdoors, “I’ll go inside unless I’m under an umbrella,” resident Frank Hampton told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. “Thing is, they’re not here during the day, it’s just at night. It’s just when they start coming around when the sun goes down.”\n\nThe city has tried everything to get the birds to find a new spot, but all success has been short lived.\n\n“We have had a falcon previously, a hawk, but it has had limited success and the crows return,” Klein said.\n\nReflectors were also a failure, given the crows tend to congregate at night. Now, the town is moving to laser pointers.\n\n“The cost of bringing in a falconry person is actually fairly high long term, and here we are mainly talking about a $20 solution and some staff time, to have a pilot program to try to resolve the problem,” Klein explained.\n\n“It’s a health problem we’ve had to deal with, and at the cost of the city, so if we have a cheap solution, there’s no reason to try it, right?” Klein said.\n\nThe mayor got the idea from a friend who has been using a green laser to disperse birds squawking in his yard. He learned other towns with bird problems were using the same technique, since it is deemed safe by the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nThe program will start at the end of the month. City staff and residents will be armed with the lasers in hopes of success.\n\n“If the green lasers don’t work by themselves, then we start looking at the sound of crows in distress or other opportunities that present themselves, but this is the first step in trying to deal with the birds,” Klein said.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of trying the technique. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society told Klein they are worried the lasers will blind the birds and cause harm to humans and aircraft.

Among the group \"admins\" include Somerset County educator, artist and firefighter Steven Speeney, who each day reminds curious members prior to the sun setting — when the drones start to ramp up — to post sightings but avoid any unpleasantries.\n\nSpeeney swiftly filters out spam posts and those creating disturbances in the group, and says he deletes \"obvious planes, reflections and blurry videos\" to keep the page \"neat and tidy for the FBI.\" He also created several engaging banners that look straight out of a true crime podcast cover, and notes that the Facebook group includes people from across the country, members of the media, those in the political and governmental space, and several drone hobbyists, professionals and experts in varying fields.\n\nWhile it's no surprise the page sparks lengthy discussion among armchair investigators each time a video or photo is posted primarily from a North or Central Jersey town, the page also has been a resource for the amused, the scared, the conspiracy theorists, experts and those quick to dissuade hypotheses. By Tuesday afternoon alone, the page had nearly 800 new posts, with over 3,500 overall since its Dec. 1 start.\n\nMorris County officials were first to address rumors of drone activity in mid-November, with sightings now stretching over eight North and Central Jersey counties, plus several shore areas in South Jersey. Flight restrictions have been imposed over Picatinny Arsenal, a military research facility in Jefferson and Rockaway townships, and a golf club in Bedminster owned and frequented by President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSeveral residents have been quick to express frustration over the lack of answers — expressions Gov. Phil Murphy said he understood when asked by reporters following a bill signing on Monday.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in North Jersey have addressed the ongoing speculation by posting similarly written press releases on social media after drones have been spotted over important infrastructure. The departments have collectively stated that there is no evidence to indicate any imminent threats to the public, with Florham Park Police Chief Joseph Orlando adding the drones' presence appeared \"nefarious in nature.\" Murphy reiterated there was no public safety concern on Monday.\n\nFears and frustrations run wild on NJ social media drone page\n\nFrom alleged \"leaked\" internal documents on how police are to handle drone queries to theories that military drones have been deployed to track nuclear fallout from a dirty bomb that has been detonated, the popular Facebook page has swirled with an array of conversation.\n\nOne member suggested residents are the ones that have \"kickstarted this whole invasion\" because \"every plane we see is automatically a drone\" since it's not often people look at the sky, particularly at night.\n\nSome have suggested companies such as Amazon drone delivery have deployed their drones, although their website states they do not deliver at night, and others have been quick to call out local companies that use drones as part of their operations.\n\nSome eagle-eyed spotters have recently posted about \"giant balls of light\" in the sky, while others have shared photos or videos of what appear to be helicopters but instead are smaller in size, and instead of a roaring engine, seemingly emit a low \"buzzing\" noise. The drones appear to maneuver at angles different than a traditional airplane, some say, with the drones traveling in groups and either moving quickly or hovering in place.\n\nFederal and state officials have yet to describe the drones, although Murphy said Monday the objects are \"very sophisticated,\" noting that \"the minute you get eyes on them, they go dark.\" And despite rumors on social media, there have been no confirmed reports of downed drones, he said.\n\nWhile theories have run rampant, some members have been fraught with worry. One member said she was \"scared to death\" after reading posts from the group and feared for her family.\n\n\"I've seen intelligent people make posts about a lot of different theories but I'm truly feeling so freaked out the more that gets said, and I'm just someone trying to stay informed but not terrified,\" she wrote in the Facebook group Monday night.\n\nAs questions remain unanswered, lawmakers have increasingly called on federal and state officials for transparency over the recent drone sightings.\n\nState Sen. Jon Bramnick, who is running for governor, called on Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday to declare a \"limited state of emergency\" to ban all drones \"until the public receives an explanation regarding these multiple sightings.” Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who is also running for governor, introduced federal legislation on Tuesday to allow state and local law enforcement to monitor future drone use.\n\nThe latest push by legislators comes after a group of North Jersey mayors and elected officials have demanded answers from Murphy, who on Monday noted federal cooperation has been \"good,\" but pleaded for more.\n\nEmail: lcomstock@njherald.com; Twitter: @LoriComstockNJH or on Facebook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/best-reads/2015/10/01/arizona-wwii-history-hoover-dam/32564733/", "title": "The Arizona piece of WWII history you never knew existed: It's ...", "text": "Shaun McKinnon\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThe Army solider crouched on the ledge, trying to avoid the concrete ceiling just inches above his head. His boots scraped the dirt as he maneuvered himself into position for the watch. He adjusted his binoculars.\n\nA 2-foot-high window in the concrete wall opened a 270-degree view. At the midpoint, on a rotating mount attached to the ledge, a machine gun aimed outward. The orders were simple: Watch for the enemy and respond if attacked.\n\nJust a few months had passed since the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into World War II. The war in Europe had already stoked fears of German spies and sneak attacks; now the nation was on alert for a Japanese invasion.\n\nBehind the ledge, stacked against one wall, was ammunition for the machine gun and for rifles that would fit through the four gun slots on either side of the window. Packs and rations leaned against another wall.\n\nSome days, as many as three soldiers pulled duty in the concrete structure. On those days, the air grew close as the day warmed. The men would ease around a concrete pillar, jockeying for space on the hard floor and along the walls, which wrapped around in wide angles to form a crooked octagon.\n\nThe structure was known as a pillbox — defensive like a bunker, but smaller, commonly used during wartime to camouflage remote guard posts. The military manned hundreds of pillboxes along the western coast of the United States during World War II, waiting for a Japanese invasion.\n\nThis one was erected in December 1941 in the weeks after Pearl Harbor. Its purpose was similar to the others': Watch for enemy activity, German or Japanese — American intelligence suspected both.\n\nBut its location was less obvious. This one was near water, but not an ocean. It sat on a bluff along the Arizona border, perched high above Lake Mead and — more strategically — Hoover Dam, the engineering landmark completed just six years earlier.\n\nThe Americans believed the Germans and, later, the Japanese wanted to destroy the 726-foot-high dam, or at least cripple its power plants, which supplied electricity for aviation and munitions manufacturers in Southern California. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operated the dam — dedicated 80 years ago in September — agreed the threat was real.\n\nWhat authorities didn't agree about was how the attack might proceed.\n\nWould it come from above, an aerial attack by bomber planes?\n\nWould it come on the ground, a sneak ambush among the sharp ridges and canyon walls?\n\nOr would saboteurs deliver a water assault, aboard boats launched on Lake Mead upstream from the dam or, more improbably, steered upstream from the Pacific Ocean?\n\nWhatever the answer, the Army would keep watch. For a year, soldiers holed up in the concrete pillbox, hidden by heavy chunks of rhyolite rock to hide it on the hillside, and they watched and waited.\n\nUntil nothing happened. Then they left.\n\nSeven decades later, the greatest dangers on this hillside are falling rocks and rattlesnakes. The pillbox is one of the few reminders of an unlikely chapter in World War II history, one filled with fantastic stories about Nazi submarines trying to navigate the Colorado River and with more plausible evidence of the strategic value of Hoover Dam. It is an artifact of America’s fears and its vigilance.\n\nAnd it’s still there, on a bluff in Arizona, hiding in plain sight.\n\nWhat's there today\n\nA visitor to Hoover Dam could walk across the top from the Arizona side to the Nevada side and back again, could take the tour deep inside, could stare at it in awe from the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge 840 feet above the Colorado River and never see the tiny WWII pillbox on the ridge.\n\nBut it’s there, and once you know it’s there — once you know where to look — you can’t not see it.\n\nCompared with the timeless architectural wonder of Hoover Dam, the pillbox looks frumpy, rustic, squatting near the edge of a cliff, its slumping rock veneer baking in the desert sun.\n\nPat Hicks, the archaeologist for the bureau’s Lower Colorado Region, crouches a little as she walks through the narrow doorway. She points to the concrete walls, floors and ceilings, each about 13 inches thick.\n\n“They took on the character of the wooden forms so fully that the ceiling almost looks like wood,” she says. The grain and the knots look as real as if the wood had petrified. The lines where the lumber planks met reflect imperfections in the cutting.\n\nInside, the box seems almost like a basement because of the low ceiling and the high windows. The pillar and the oddly angled walls squeeze floor space and magnify the sense of confinement. The ledge where the machine gun was installed would offer little range of movement for the man on duty.\n\nThe military built pillboxes when time or materials were short. The structures were generally small and often built on hills or outcroppings. At its longest and widest points, the one at Hoover Dam is 21 feet, 6 inches by 13 feet, 6 inches. It has eight walls of varying widths.\n\nWork crews poured the concrete box and then added the rocky camouflage of volcanic rhyolite mined from the same ridge. Construction took just two or three weeks in December 1941. The Army dispatched troops for the pillbox and other guard posts around the dam.\n\n“It was sort of a mystery who built it for a long time,” Hicks said. “The answer to that mystery was in front of everybody’s noses.”\n\nBlueprints, files, crew and equipment lists: None of it was preserved for historians. Then one photograph turned up amid hundreds of others. It showed construction of the pillbox on the ridge, the site barely visible on the edge of the image, captured as an accident, an afterthought or a purposeful attempt to cast attention toward the dam and Lake Mead, which was full at the time, and away from the post.\n\nWhat historians were most interested in: The men in the photo were wearing civilian overalls, which meant, Hicks says, that the bureau built the pillbox for the Army.\n\nOtherwise, with no records, no accounts of the year the pillbox was manned, historians have had to deduce much of what occurred in the structure based on information from other such sites and clues from the box itself. A stash of documents unearthed in 2001 revealed a deep level of fear among high-level government officials and evidence of a threat more real than anyone let on.\n\nWhy they built the box\n\nThe last bucket of concrete was poured at Hoover Dam — then known more commonly as Boulder Dam — in May 1935, and on Sept. 30, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke at a dedication ceremony, calling the dam “the greatest dam in the world” and “an engineering victory of the first order.”\n\nThe dam began to draw sightseers from the start, and the number of visitors grew when the first tours were offered in 1937.\n\nBut it also drew another kind of attention. As fighting escalated across Europe, American intelligence operatives began to hear chatter about threats on U.S. soil. Hoover Dam, with its power turbines, emerged as a potential target for sabotage.\n\nIn August 1939, the acting commissioner for the bureau wrote a letter to an Interior Department official. The letter was uncovered in 2001 by Christine Pfaff, a bureau historian who wrote a detailed account about efforts to safeguard Hoover Dam during World War II.\n\n\"It might be necessary to close Boulder Power Plant to the public, and to arrange for special policing of other structures and plants to provide protection from possible saboteurs,\" wrote Henry Bashore.\n\nBarely two months later, according to the reports Pfaff reviewed, a ranger at the dam saw a German tourist taking a series of photographs near the dam. At one point, the tourist was heard reprimanding a woman who had accompanied him for appearing too prominently in some of the pictures, spoiling them.\n\nThen on Nov. 30, 1939, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico warned the State Department of a Nazi plot to bomb the dam’s intake towers, the concrete structures used to pull water from Lake Mead into the power plant. In a dispatch to Washington, the embassy said German agents were found in Mexico City with the plans for the sabotage plot. Nazi spies living in Las Vegas had already visited the dam a dozen times to lay the groundwork.\n\nThe Germans, according to the embassy, would rent boats in the guise of a fishing trip and then steer the boats toward the intake towers. Once there, they would attach bombs to the towers and then escape in the boats.\n\nAt the direction of the State Department, the Bureau of Reclamation immediately banned private boats from the vicinity of the dam. Over the next month, floodlights were installed at the dam and wire netting was stretched across the lake to block watercraft from within 300 feet of the towers.\n\nThe security measures occurred quietly and the government denied some of them at first, insisting any precautions were related to “uncertain times,” according to the documents reviewed by Pfaff.\n\nIn February 1940, the War Department sent top-secret intelligence to the bureau warning that the sabotage threat was dire.\n\n\"Life and death orders have been given by Berlin to put LA in the black,” according to the records. “Unless quick action is taken, some terminal transformer station somewhere near Boulder Dam and another station in Los Angeles are doomed also to be sabotaged.”\n\nHow fear ran wild\n\nWild rumors about new Nazi plots ratcheted paranoia among officials at the bureau and in Congress. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, submitted 38 security recommendations to protect the dam and its assets, including new security patrols, inspection stations on the approach to the dam in Nevada and Arizona and closer scrutiny of tour groups and other visitors.\n\nThe bureau desperately sought resources, but the agency was told the military needed all available arms and ammunition to prepare for war. Sen. Pat McCarran of Nevada introduced a bill in Congress to establish a military post near the dam to fortify its defenses.\n\nSo often repeated was the threat that it took on an almost inevitable air. Director Alfred Hitchcock introduced it in his 1942 spy thriller \"Saboteur.\" The unlikely heroes stumble into — and then thwart — a plot by a band of American fifth columnists to blow up Hoover Dam. The saboteurs later plant explosives at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to stop the launch of a new battleship, still cursing the failure of their attempt to disable the dam.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, rising fears fed more fantastical ideas about how to stop real-life bad guys, according to the documents discovered by Pfaff.\n\nJ.P. Durbin, noted as “a concerned resident of California,” suggested building a steel and concrete canopy over the canyon to hide the dam. Rock and gravel scattered atop the structure could prevent damage from aerial bombs.\n\nOskar J.W. Hansen, the artist who sculpted the bronze winged figures that sit on the Nevada side of the dam, also believed the dam was a possible aerial target. He proposed installing steel cables in the canyon walls to form a protective grid over the dam and the power plan. The upper-level cables would be fitted with armor-plated shields to deflect bombs.\n\nLater still, another artist and bureau consultant, Allen T. True, proposed building a “dummy dam” downstream from Hoover as a decoy. The dam, three-quarters the size of the real thing, would be built of wire and its surface painted to simulate the actual dam.\n\nTrue’s real contribution, Pfaff wrote, may have been articulating the threat to Hoover and Parker dams on the Colorado River and, later, Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington state. The dams supplied half the electricity used by manufacturers in the West, he would write in 1943, and were easy targets inadequately protected.\n\nSome of the threats were all too real, the documents suggest. Others sounded like a plot from a madcap spy picture, like the one about a Nazi submarine, which surfaced several times in the 1940s (the story, not the sub).\n\nNazi agents, the story went, planned to navigate the Colorado River from the Sea of Cortez all the way up to Hoover Dam, where they would mount their assault.\n\nAccording to various accounts, the German agents would pilot the sub to Yuma, disassemble it, load it on a truck and haul it on the highway to a spot north of Parker Dam, where it would be reassembled and submerged again for the final leg of the trip to Hoover.\n\nThe sub was never sighted. But that didn't mean the dam didn't need to be protected.\n\nThus came the protection\n\nAs security tightened at the dam, government officials began to argue about the nature of the threat, according to Hicks, the archaeologist for the bureau at Hoover Dam. The bureau and the Interior Department feared an aerial attack. The War Department believed saboteurs would approach by land.\n\n“There was always that tension between the War Department and what they thought was going on and the bureau and what they thought would happen,” Hicks said.\n\nThe bickering ended Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and drew the Untied States into war. Within days, the bureau and the War Department laid out plans for heightened security. The bureau closed the dam to all non-official visitors. Security checkpoints were set up on the roads leading to the dam from Arizona and Nevada.\n\nOn Dec. 8, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes wrote to the Army seeking help. Within days, work had begun on guard posts, including the pillbox on the Arizona ridge.\n\nHicks said it’s never been clear where the bureau or the Army found the design for the pillbox. It could have been an Army-issue blueprint or it could have been laid out by the bureau, which supplied the manpower and the materials. A schematic of the box prepared by the National Park Service for a restoration project shows uneven wall sizes and angles, a design perhaps dictated by the location on top of the ridge.\n\nIncomplete records suggest there was another guard post on the Nevada side of the dam, but Hicks said she’s never found evidence of a similar structure. A map used the letters “MGN,” for machine gun nest.\n\n“We’ve never found the sister to this one,” she said. “I’m thinking there was another location on the west side, near a switching yard, but it was probably more of a nest, maybe just something made with boulders.”\n\nThe Army established a command post in the newly completed public exhibit building and stationed troops there, in the steep hills on either side of the dam and at the two security checkpoints.\n\nFor a year, Army soldiers manned the pillbox daily, watching for incursions along the canyon walls, from the rocky slopes, from Lake Mead, on the dam itself, even from the Colorado River on the downstream side.\n\nNothing happened, even as the government grew more convinced the dam was a target. Sometime in late 1942 or early 1943, the Army left the pillbox. The bureau couldn’t afford to hire more guards or buy enough ammunition and so, after a year of operation, the post was abandoned.\n\nHiding the past\n\nA few feet from the doorway into the pillbox, a boulder rests on a patch of the ridge, almost poised to block the structure’s opening. And, for a while, it did.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Bureau of Reclamation and the National Park Service — which manages Lake Mead National Recreation Area — decided to open the pillbox to the public as a historic site.\n\nThe public behaved badly. Visitors defaced the walls inside with graffiti and left garbage on the floor. In 1982, someone hiked up the ridge and tore down a section of the rhyolite veneer. The concrete box, with its 13-inch-thick walls, was undamaged.\n\n“But the wall was laying in a big heap of rubble,” Hicks says.\n\nThe park service brought in a stonemason and restored the rock camouflage, employing the same masonry techniques and the same rock used to build the box in 1941.\n\nThe bureau decided enough was enough and closed public access. Someone rolled the big boulder into the doorway, cementing it in place, and there it sat for a while.\n\nAfter a few years, the bureau considered reopening the box to visitors. The boulder was carefully moved out of the way. Hicks said a suggestion to blow it apart was rejected and the bureau decided it could be an interesting interpretive feature.\n\nBut visitor rules meant the bureau couldn’t just point the way up the ridge and post a sign at the top. The box was too close to the ridge and would need guardrails. The trail would not be accessible to disabled visitors and would require rebuilding.\n\nAnd there were the snakes.\n\n“What we would be doing was altering the setting too much,” Hicks says. “It wasn’t worth it. This is a neat, neat, neat thing that’s out here.”\n\nWhat’s left are a lot of good stories. The German tourists. The Nazi fisherman. The canopy and the dummy dam.The Nazi sub.\n\nThe government scoffs at the wildest of the stories, although true believers still insist parts of the secret submarine were discovered near Yuma, that wreckage was hauled out farther upriver, that the bureau confiscated the remnants and has covered up the plot, possibly storing what was left somewhere deep in Lake Mead.\n\nHicks chuckles at the stories. There were secrets during the war and some remain today. But the reality is, neither the Germans nor the Japanese succeeded in attacking Hoover Dam or disabling its power plants. How close they got is not evident in the records. Whether the pillbox accomplished its mission is also a mystery..\n\nThere are hints at the security measures installed during the war. A fence below the dam. The nets above the dam.\n\nIn 2001, in the weeks following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the government established a security checkpoint on the Nevada side of the dam in the exact location where visitors were stopped after Pearl Harbor.\n\nAnd the pillbox remains, solid as the concrete and the rocks it’s made of. It’s not open to the public. The door is always padlocked, the windows covered with wire that keeps out any interlopers except those of the small critter variety. It's not often noticed by the one million people who visit the dam each year.\n\nIf you see it, you’ll know. It’s hidden in plain sight.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/az-narratives/2014/12/04/uss-arizona-pearl-harbor-survivors/19892203/", "title": "USS Arizona: The men who survived", "text": "Shaun McKinnon\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nGRASS VALLEY, Calif.\n\nLou Conter is telling the story of the night his patrol bomber was shot down seven miles off the coast of New Guinea, dumping the seaplane's 10-man crew into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew was not alone in the water.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"We had 10 or 12 sharks around us all the time,\" Conter says. \"I told the men, 'If a shark comes close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.'\"\n\nThe men stayed afloat until another plane saw the burning wreckage and tossed out a life raft. The exhausted crew dragged ashore an hour later and hid in the jungle, fearful they would be captured by Japanese soldiers. The next night, an American PT boat retrieved all 10 men.\n\nAs Conter told it, the story wasn't about punching sharks, or skulking in the jungle or chasing shadows to the waiting rescue boat. Conter was talking about survival, about coming back alive.\n\nHis time in the war started that way.\n\nHe was 20 when he escaped the burning wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor. He tried to save as many injured crewmen as he could, but when the sun set on Dec. 7, 1941, he was one of just 335 sailors who did not perish.\n\nConter fought on through World War II, scraped past a lot of close calls, then went to Korea. After that, he started teaching U.S. troops the skills of survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He wrote a training manual whose precepts the Navy still follows. Today, he tries to pass on what he knows to students of history.\n\nAt 93, he is one of the last survivors of the attack on the Arizona. He endured what he did, he says, because that was his job. And that's what he told every soldier and airman who took his courses.\n\nWhatever happens, find a way to survive.\n\nConter was stationed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in September 1941, when he turned 20. He and a buddy had been talking about their future in the Navy.\n\n\"Lou, let's go to flight school,\" Conter's buddy said one day.\n\n\"We won't get in,\" Conter said. \"We're right-arm rates.\" At the time, sailors wore patches designating their rates, the enlisted expression of rank, on the right or left sleeve, depending on their assignment. Aviators most often arose from left-arm rates.\n\nConter had made friends with a young lady in Honolulu. Her father was an engineer and a top executive for a dredging company with a big Navy contract. Conter was at the young lady's house one day when her father received an important visitor: Admiral William Calhoun, the commander of base force for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nCalhoun quizzed Conter about his posting, his job on the ship. Conter told the admiral he was interested in flight school, but doubted he would earn admission.\n\nCalhoun told Conter to put in for the assignment. A few weeks later, Conter and his buddy passed a flight test at sea and on Nov. 1, they got their orders: Report to Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Arizona's captain called the two sailors in and told them the ship was headed back to Long Beach in early December. They could ride to the mainland then and leave for Florida.\n\nTheir orders were lost on the Arizona when the battleship sank on Dec. 7. Conter and his buddy waited for new instructions, but heard nothing.\n\nIn early January, Conter visited his young lady friend again and again, Admiral Calhoun was there.\n\n\"I thought you'd be in flight school,\" he said.\n\nConter told him about the lost orders. Three days later, he and his buddy were on a ship to San Francisco and then a train to Pensacola.\n\nConter got his wings in November 1942. He was soon flying one of the Navy's Black Cats, a squadron of long-range patrol bombers painted black for night missions.\n\nThe Black Cats flew surveillance, search and rescue, sea patrol, but they proved especially valuable for nighttime assaults and nuisance raids on Japanese submarines and ships. The planes could fly at low altitudes, then buzz upward for a bombing run, confounding enemy gunners trying to calculate speed and distance.\n\nThe crews were based on tender ships moored in secluded harbors. Conter served on the San Pablo and Half Moon. The planes took off and landed on the water; the pilots tied up to buoys near the ship.\n\n\"We'd leave at 5:30 in the evening and stay out 12 or 14 hours, then return in the morning,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes, we'd come back, eat, then sleep on the beach.\"\n\nConter's crews flew missions across the South Pacific: New Guinea, Borneo, New Britain, the coast off Perth, Australia.\n\nThe crews learned the routines of the Japanese ships. The best time for a bombing raid was after 1 a.m., when the ship was quiet.\n\n\"We wouldn't get much fire back and by the time they sounded general quarters, we were on our way,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes they'd get shooting at you and you'd look at the shells and they looked like they were going to hit you. Then they'd go by.\"\n\nConter's plane hadn't been out long in September 1943 when enemy bullets pierced one of their rear hatches and hit a parachute flare. The flare exploded and started a fire, which forced the plane into the water.\n\n\"Say your prayers, men, we're seven miles off shore and we're in 10, 15-foot swells,\" one of the officers said as the crew abandoned the plane. \"I don't think we'll ever be able to swim to shore.\"\n\n\"Baloney,\" Conter replied. \"Knock it off. Just stay together, hold hands and kick slowly 'cause there'll be sharks around. If a shark comes too close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.\"\n\nThe men helped one another, holding up anyone who weakened. Not long after, a second plane dropped a life raft and all 10 of the crew made to shore and, the next night, back to the base.\n\nIn late 1943, Conter flew a mission to rescue more than 200 coast watchers in New Guinea. Coast watchers were military intelligence operatives who gathered information about enemy activities on islands across the South Pacific.\n\nThe planes flew up the Sepik River from the northern coast of New Guinea. The river wound through dense vegetation, leaving 15 or 20 feet of clearance on each side of the plane. If a plane crashed, crocodiles awaited in the river.\n\n\"In three days, we rescued 219 coast watchers without losing anybody,\" Conter said. \"The Japanese were only a mile away. It was one of the biggest rescues in World War II, but no one knew about it because everything was top secret in those days.\"\n\nIn Korea, Conter flew 29 missions, but his work in Naval intelligence left him vulnerable if the North Koreans captured him, so he was shipped to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in February 1954, the rank he held until he retired. His work turned toward survival training in a new military program called SERE, for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.\n\nConter helped establish training bases in Florida and California and in 1965, he returned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for troops headed to Vietnam.\n\nHe had stopped at Pearl Harbor more than a decade earlier, on his way to a posting in Korea. A platform marked the wreckage of the USS Arizona. Conter and others in his group boarded a boat to go out to the platform and see his old ship.\n\n\"We got halfway there and I told them to turn around,\" Conter said. \"I wasn't going out there. I couldn't.\"\n\nIn 1967, Conter retired from the Navy. More than 20 years earlier, he had earned his real estate license in California and had maintained it. He settled in Palm Springs and built a career as a real estate developer, buying up land for commercial and residential projects.\n\nThat same year, he met his wife, Valerie, in Palm Springs. Her sister knew Jack Warner, the film studio mogul, and invited Valerie to a movie premiere party Warner was hosting in Palm Springs for his latest project, \"Camelot\".\n\nConter attended the same event and was seated next to Valerie. They struck up a conversation and, after a brief courtship, married.\n\nToday, Lou and Valerie Conter live in a two-level house at the end of a winding road on a golf course in Grass Valley, a mountain town about 60 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nTall pines tower over the house. Deer and rabbits wander the hillside. Golfers play through 50 yards from Conter's driveway.\n\n\"I'm going to be back out there one of these days,\" Conter said, his voice wistful as he watches a foursome trying to stay on the greens. Conter's doctor has sidelined him for now for health reasons, but he is certain he will return soon.\n\nHe took up golf seriously in Palm Springs and played in the Bob Hope Classic six times, once on a team with crooner Johnny Mathis. He keeps a photo from that tournament on a bookshelf in an alcove off the kitchen.\n\nOn the same bookshelf sit mementos from his time on the Arizona. Medals. Photographs. A painting of the Arizona hangs on the wall of a sitting room. He keeps a folder of newspaper clippings, magazine stories and copies of a telegram.\n\n\"Here's the one that told my mother I was missing in action on the Arizona,\" he says. It is dated Dec. 21, 1941.\n\n\"The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Louis Anthony Counter quartermaster third class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThe telegram, which misspelled Conter's last name, promises further information and asks his family not to divulge Conter's posting.\n\nA second telegram, dated Jan. 6 reported that Conter was alive and would contact his family.\n\n\"I'd already sent word, even before the first one got there,\" he says. \"So they knew.\"\n\nThough Conter turned around the first time he ventured toward the sunken Arizona, he has been back since, to see it with other survivors.\n\nHe joined the USS Arizona Reunion Association and stays in touch with a few of the remaining survivors. One, Joe Langdell, lives about 40 miles away in Yuba City.\n\nHe keeps up with what the military does, and some of it irritates him. Discipline seems less important than it was in his day. Too many strategic decisions come down from Washington instead of from the commanders on the ground.\n\nAnd he has watched with dismay the changes in survival training. He once helped design programs that sent soldiers into the wilds for days or weeks at a time. Now, some courses require less than a week of field time.\n\n\"You can't get a guy hungry in three or four days,\" Conter says.\n\nBut there are moments when he knows what he did meant something. His old co-pilot in the New Guinea days was asked once if he'd had survival training for the war.\n\n\"He said, 'I had survival training in the ocean. We had survival training on the job. And my co-pilot, Lou Conter, saved my life.'\"\n\nConter stares at his hands.\n\n\"Some things,\" he says, \"you don't know about what they'll mean until years later.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS\n\nOnce a month or so, Clarendon Hetrick's phone rings with a call from Utah. On the other end of the line is an old shipmate from the USS Saratoga, the aircraft carrier where Hetrick worked as a mechanic through most of World War II.\n\nFor an hour or so, the two men talk. They catch up. They trade stories. Not war stories, usually, not unless one of them has had it out with a doctor or a pushy clerk. Just stories, the kind buddies tell each other.\n\n\"He's there anytime I call him,\" Hetrick says. \"He's there for me. I guess he'd do anything he could for me. He's more like family than just a friend.\"\n\nHetrick, who is 91, has outlived most of the men he knew on the Saratoga. He is one of nine living survivors from the attack on the USS Arizona, the battleship he boarded in 1941 when he was 17.\n\nHe will answer questions about that December day when he escaped the burning wreckage of the Arizona, reciting as many of the details as he can remember. The new shoes he left on the deck of the sinking ship, the ones he intended to retrieve later. The shock of jumping into a harbor knowing he couldn't swim.\n\nBut he kept most of it to himself until he started meeting up with other survivors, years after he retired from the military.\n\n\"I was always wanting to learn more when I was younger,\" says Hetrick's younger son, Robert, who lives not far from his dad in Las Vegas. \"But I had a brother in Vietnam who didn't want to talk about it at all, so I guess I realized if they want to talk, they'll talk. That was the way it was.\"\n\nHetrick shrugs, trying to get comfortable in the recliner. \"It just didn't appeal to me to bring it up,\" he says.\n\nFires still burned on the broken USS Arizona the morning after the Japanese ambush. Hetrick slept on the battleship USS Tennessee, which had been moored just ahead of the Arizona along Ford Island.\n\nThe Tennessee took hits in the attack, but two of the armor piercing bombs, the kind that sunk the Arizona, failed to detonate. Debris from the Arizona showered the Tennessee's stern and started fires, but the vessel stayed afloat.\n\nHetrick took a motor launch to the receiving station on shore, where he and other survivors were allowed to shower and given a change of clothes. The men followed orders in a fog of wonderment and confusion.\n\n\"We didn't hear much from the outside at first,\" Hetrick said. \"It hadn't really sunk in what had happened.\"\n\nThe Navy began assigning sailors to new postings. Hetrick was sent to the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. The ship remained anchored outside Pearl Harbor for most of a month as U.S. commanders planned their next move against the Japanese in the South Pacific.\n\nOne day, a Navy officer came on board and asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for an assignment in the aviation section. Hetrick thought about it. He liked the idea of working as an aircraft mechanic, so he volunteered.\n\n\"They gave me 30 minutes to get off the ship and catch a transport to San Diego for training,\" he said. \"It didn't take me that long. I had one pair of dungarees and that was it, that and a towel and shaving gear.\"\n\nThe Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor not long after. It never returned, crippled in the Battle of the Coral Sea and scuttled by the Navy to keep the enemy from salvaging her.\n\nAfter about six months of training in San Diego, Hetrick returned to Honolulu and joined the USS Saratoga, the sister ship of the Lexington. He worked on board as a mechanic for a torpedo squadron and ended up in charge of the hydraulic shop.\n\nThe Saratoga sailed across the South Pacific, to Guam, the Philippines, around New Guinea. Hetrick was on board during battles at Midway and Wake Island and for the U.S. invasion of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The Saratoga was attacked by six Japanese suicide bombers within about 24 hours.\n\n\"I put on two life jackets,\" Hetrick said. \"I told another kid if they come back again tonight, I'm leaving.\"\n\nHetrick earned a Purple Heart for wounds during one of the bombing raids.\n\nThe Saratoga had returned to Pearl Harbor by the time the Japanese surrendered. The Navy loaded 5,000 bunks on board, along with a row of portable latrines, and the Saratoga sailed to San Francisco, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge with toilet paper streamers and thousands of sailors who needed something to do.\n\nHetrick was still just 21 by then, but a seasoned sailor who shared little in common with the 17-year-old kid who left high school and joined the Navy on his parents' signature.\n\n\"I didn't have the slightest idea what would happen when I signed up,\" he said. \"I decided I'd do whatever they told me to. When they said, 'grab your sea bags and let's go,' I did.\"\n\nWhen he first arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hetrick wasn't even old enough to buy a beer until he found a place where they didn't ask questions if a guy was in a service uniform.\n\nNow, stateside again, Hetrick reported to a Navy station in San Diego, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Jeanne. As his stint was about to end, the Navy decided to transfer him back to Pearl Harbor. He asked if Jeanne could come with him.\n\n\"They said, 'If you re-enlist, we'll send her over.' I said, 'You send her over, I'll re-enlist.' I'd been told things like that before. They wouldn't send her over so I didn't re-enlist.\"\n\nBut Hetrick couldn't find work, so inside of six months, he signed up for the Navy Reserve. He was sent to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station up the coast in Orange County.\n\nIn 1949, the newly created U.S. Air Force was trying to fill it out its ranks with experienced support crews, almost begging for mechanics who knew the aircraft. Hetrick saw a new opportunity and joined.\n\n\"On the day I swore into the Air Force, I was still in my Navy uniform,\" he said. \"Three months later, I was in Korea.\"\n\nHe worked his way up to crew chief on a squadron of B-26 bombers,\n\nAfter 18 months overseas, he returned to Langley Field in Virginia. (\"Two of us with the same rank were up for the same kind of job,\" he said. \"He wanted the east coast, I wanted the west coast. He got the west coast and I got the east coast. So you see how that works.\")\n\nFrom Virginia, he went to Utah, to France and then to Albuquerque, where he retired in November 1961.\n\nHe was on his own once again, he and his young family. They moved to Modesto, Calif., where he got a job driving a produce truck in the fruit orchards.\n\n\"They paid me by the day,\" he said. \"After 36 hours, I still hadn't put in a day. I asked the boss, 'how many hours is in a day for you?' He said, 'whatever I can get out of you.' I quit. I wasn't working for nothing.\"\n\nHe hired on with a farm labor contractor and within a year, he and a guy he worked with started their own business, contracting with the orchard owners to harvest crops. They covered the growing seasons: cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, grapes.\n\nThe venture was working out well. Until his partner ran off with all the money.\n\nHetrick recovered. He built a reputation as a guy who could bring in the harvest on time.\n\nAround 2005, he and Jeanne moved to Bullhead City. A few years after that, they left for Las Vegas, where their son, Bob, and his family help them get around.\n\nLas Vegas seems to like Hetrick. He was at a restaurant last summer and someone noticed his USS Arizona cap. He didn't have to pay for dinner.\n\nHetrick turns a rusted chunk of metal over in his hands, running his fingers along the curves and edges. It is a piece of rigging used to secure a mooring line from a ship.\n\nFrom the USS Arizona.\n\nHe first visited the Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor on the 50th anniversary of the attack and has returned since.\n\n\"It gets your breath when you first see it,\" he says. \"It's hard to explain.\" He thinks back. \"You know, you can see where I came out of, the hatchway. There's a little air bubble. It's the same place where the oil is leaking\" — oil stores aboard the ship that, even today, still seep to the surface — \"that's where I got out from below.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hetrick returned to Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary of the Japanese attack. He had visited before, but this trip meant more. He brought all of his family: his wife Jeanne, his three sons and their families. And he was allowed to visit a part of the Arizona few people ever see.\n\nDuring construction of the memorial, the Navy sliced off pieces of the Arizona's wreckage to make room for the structure that sits above the sunken ship today. The pieces – the largest is about as long as a bus – sit in a salvage yard on the Waipi'o Peninsula on Oahu. The Navy occasionally cuts away small bits of the wreckage for memorials.\n\nFor Hetrick, the section of mooring line links him to those final moments of the Arizona. He will tell his story if he's asked and he will remember details along the way.\n\n\"I remember hearing explosions at first,\" he says. \"It sounded like someone shooting guns. You don't fire guns in port, so I ran out real quick to see what was happening. I saw one airplane, with a big red meatball on the side. Nobody could debate what that was, no question about it.\"\n\nHe remembers the crewman trying to climb a ladder to escape through a hatchway on the deck. The man told him later he had broken both his hips in one of the explosions and had survived only because Hetrick was there to urge him on.\n\nHetrick still likes to talk about the new shoes he bought the day before the attack in Honolulu. As he prepared to jump off the burning ship, he took the shoes off and set them on the quarterdeck.\n\n\"I left them there and hoped to get them back,\" he says. \"I ain't seen 'em since.\"\n\nHe remembers when the order was given to abandon ship. He jumped into the harbor, even though he had never passed his swimming test.\n\n\"When somebody says get out of here and you're on a hundred tons of ammunition, well, you don't question it,\" he says. \"If somebody in authority said do something back then, you didn't question it. I think that's what kept me living to this day.\"\n\nHe's not sure he'd have learned that lesson if he hadn't enlisted in the Navy. He says that decision was the best thing he could have done.\n\n\"I'd do it a hundred times more,\" he says.\n\nPROVO, Utah\n\nKen Potts eases around the side of the pool table, waving toward items like a museum tour guide in a back room.\n\n\"This shows where all the ships were,\" he says, pointing at a map depicting Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. \"There's the battleships … there's the Nevada, the Arizona, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, Maryland, the Oklahoma. The California was way down here.\"\n\nHe stops in front of a newspaper, the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with the headline: \"WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES\"\n\n\"That's one of the first extras that was put out that day,\" Potts says. \"I bought it at the receiving station in Pearl Harbor. It's in good shape for a paper.\"\n\nFarther down the paneled wall hangs a painting of the USS Arizona, the battleship Navy recruit Potts boarded in December 1939. By 1941, he worked the cranes on the ship, a job that entailed retrieving the Arizona's small seaplanes after they landed on the water.\n\nHe points out the cranes and the locations along the ship where he would tie up the motor boats he piloted to fetch supplies and ferry sailors to and from shore. He gazes at the picture.\n\n\"They were saying, when it first started, some of the ones whose station was up here – \"\n\nHe traces his finger up onto the main forward mast, to the crow's nest and the bridge. He clears his throat. \"They tried to jump off. Some of 'em made it, some of 'em landed on the deck. That was the end of it.\"\n\nA moment passes. He returns his attention to the cranes and the catapults that flung the seaplanes into flight.\n\n\"Once after we crossed the equator, one of the planes came back,\" he says. \"The sea was real rough when it came in and the sharks started gathering around. They called the Marines out with rifles to protect the plane and the guys while we hauled it in.\"\n\nPotts was returning to the Arizona with fresh produce when the first Japanese bombers dove into Pearl Harbor. He climbed aboard the ship, ducking to avoid bullets from the gunner planes. He helped rescue some of his shipmates. Seventy-three years later, he is one of just nine survivors of the attack on the Arizona.\n\nHe keeps the mementos from his experience – the maps, the photos, the clippings, the medals, the painting – in a room behind a door on the side wall of the living room in the house where he has lived for 54 years. He doesn't like to talk about the attack. Sometimes he can't control his emotions, so he declines speaking requests.\n\nBut he is proud of his service, of the other sailors on the Arizona. And there's a trophy in the corner the paneled room that means as much as anything else there.\n\nA few weeks after the war started, sometime in early 1942, Potts opened a letter from his mother. Why is the FBI checking up on you, she wanted to know. Someone from the bureau had been asking questions. He heard the same stories from his grandmother and his aunts.\n\nHe didn't know what to tell them. It scared him a little. Potts was working aboard an oil tanker, making short runs out of the harbor to refuel ships anchored off the coast. In the chaotic days following the Dec. 7 ambush, the Navy wasn't letting ships into the harbor, fearful the Japanese might send in more bombers.\n\nFinally, after a few weeks on the tanker, Potts was handed a new assignment. He would work in the port director's office, delivering sealed packets to the captains of Navy ships. Inside the packets were the captains' new orders, military secrets, classified information that required clearance to handle.\n\nThat's why the FBI was nosing around me, Potts thought.\n\n\"These captains of the ships, when they left the states, they had no idea where they were going, just that they're going via Pearl Harbor,\" Potts said.\n\nHe resumed one of his old jobs from the Arizona, piloting motor launches from the receiving station out to the Navy ships.\n\nPotts was based out of the port director's office – there were two, one at the harbor, one on the ninth floor of the Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu – but he logged most of his hours at the controls of the motor boat, a Jeep or a station wagon.\n\n\"The station wagon was for the captains of some of the ships that would come in,\" he said. \"Not Navy ships, other ships. The Navy captain who lived on Waikiki Beach gave a lot of parties and invited these guys. I had to take them to the parties and sit there until it was over.\"\n\nThe parties sometimes dragged into the early morning hours.\n\n\"It was boring,\" Potts says. \"But it was a lot better than being shot at.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his thoughts on the work in the office. He tried not to remember the days after the attack. The day when they assigned him and a crew of divers to a motor launch and sent them to the Arizona to remove bodies of dead sailors.\n\n\"When they dropped that bomb that made our ammunition explode, it dang near broke the ship in two, so we couldn't go anywhere forward of that,\" he says. \"We took all the bodies we could find.\"\n\nWhen he reaches that part of his story, he stops. He can't relive those images anymore. He describes the store of booze they pulled out of safe and the money.\n\n\"One day our boat was stacked with two dollar bills,\" he said. \"They paid everybody in two dollar bills back then. We hauled it all back in.\"\n\nPotts stayed in Honolulu until the end of the war. He finally received his orders to return to the states. He would sail to San Francisco on one of the cruise ships refitted to move troops, the Lurline, or maybe the Matsonia.\n\nAs he was packing, a buddy warned him that his possessions would be searched at the port in San Francisco. If they found anything that belonged to the Navy or hadn't been approved, they'd take it.\n\nPotts picked up the Colt 45 he'd found on Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. The gun took away some of the terror he had felt from the moment he saw the first bomber, the panic he felt when he found the armories on board the ship locked. With a gun, he could defend himself. He had held on to it through the war.\n\nBut he didn't want to start his civilian life in the brig, so he left it in Honolulu.\n\n\"We got into San Francisco,\" he says, \"and they never even opened my bags. Never would've found it.\"\n\nHe bought another gun in the states and he is never far from it. A pistol sits on top of his television at home. He keeps it with him when he travels. And he keeps it loaded.\n\n\"It ain't worth a damn if it ain't loaded,\" he says.\n\nPotts returned to Illinois in late 1945 to await his formal discharge, hanging out in Chicago. He was still active, so would report to the Navy Pier each morning to check a list for the names of sailors who had been given duties for the day. His name never appeared and he would leave for the day.\n\n\"I came back to the pier one morning and my name was on the list to do KP work,\" he says. Kitchen patrol. Mess hall duty. Peeling potatoes.\n\n\"I went and found the head guy and by the time I got through explaining things to him,\" Potts says, \"my name was never on that list again.\"\n\nHis mother had moved to Decatur, Ill., by then, so he followed and took a job at a hardware store. He started chatting up a regular customer, a contractor, and got a job building houses.\n\n\"What houses they built!\" Potts says, shaking his head. \"That lumber was so damn green then, we used to kid we had to shoot the squirrels out of it.\"\n\nHe wasn't happy where he was, so he loaded up his big 12-cylinder Lincoln Zephyr and headed west. He stopped in the small town of Payson, Utah.\n\n\"They said what a wonderful place it was to live, with jobs and everything, so I bought a little place up in Spanish Fork,\" he says, \"I'm still looking for that easy money.\"\n\nWith his experience running cranes on the Arizona, Potts figures he could have landed a decent job at the Geneva Steel operation, but he didn't want to work shifts, so he worked as a carpenter again and eventually went into the used car business with a friend.\n\nHe moved to Provo and sold cars until 1990. He and his wife, Doris, have lived in the same house for 54 years.\n\nThe paneled room behind the door in the living room of the Provo house is filled with trophies of almost any imaginable sort. Two deer racks (his wife shot one, his son the other). Guns. Knives. A bow. An impressive collection of restaurant menus from 30 years of cross-country searches for used cars.\n\nAnd in the back corner, a real trophy. It sits a little higher than most items, but not necessarily on a platform. It fit in that location. And it holds deep meaning for Potts, even though he did nothing to win it.\n\nPotts had not returned to Honolulu in the decades since he left for San Francisco in 1945. He wasn't ready to see it all again, to sharpen the memories he'd tried to dull.\n\nIn 2006, one of his sons offered to take Potts to Hawaii for the 65th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He stayed on the 17th floor of a hotel on Waikiki Beach. He visited the memorial and was relieved to see the builders got it right.\n\n\"It's one of the best actual memorials I've seen,\" he says. \"It's where the war started.\"\n\nFive years later, in 2011, he got a call from the band director at Timpview High School in Provo. The marching band had been invited to fly to Pearl Harbor and perform at activities commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack.\n\nThe band members had decided they wanted to honor survivors from that day. Would Ken be willing to go as a guest of honor? The band would cover all expenses for him and Doris.\n\nPotts was touched. He could see the band was sincere. To prepare for the trip, they were studying World War II history, attending lectures, writing research papers. They offered to perform at a gathering of Utah survivors. How could he say no?\n\n\"Talk about treating you like royalty,\" he says. He was able to visit the national cemetery at an area called the Punch Bowl. He watched the band perform and stood as a survivor of the Arizona, one of the sailors who lived. He went out to the floating memorial.\n\n\"I got the lay a wreath in front of the names of the fallen,\" he says quietly.\n\nWhen he returned home, he got another call from the band director. The band had won a trophy in one of the competitions during their stay in Honolulu. They had voted. They were dedicating it to Potts and wanted him to have it.\n\nHe squeezes past the pool table, past the photos and the maps and the medals. Here is a story he will tell, a memory he will keep.\n\nThe trophy sits on a small white base that raises it above other items on a shelf. It is about three feet tall, with a carved island figure on top and the silhouette of a Hawaiian warrior on a plaque. The inscription reads \"Spirit of Aloha Award, Timpview High School Marching Band.\"\n\nHe touches the trophy.\n\n\"It's my pride and joy.\"\n\nLA MIRADA, Calif.\n\nFor 30 years, Lauren Bruner punched a clock at a manufacturing plant south of Los Angeles, a World War II veteran in a landscape crawling with them.\n\nNo one knew much about Bruner's years in the Navy, not the early years anyway. The easy stories he'd tell. The ones that gave him nightmares, the stories from the day he nearly burned to death, he kept to himself.\n\nYet in a place where you couldn't cross the street without running into a war vet, Bruner was not just another ex-sailor who made it home. Only 335 men survived the bombing of the USS Arizona, the mighty battleship whose loss at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, inspired a nation to go to war.\n\nBruner was one of them.\n\nBy 1991, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the number of living Arizona crewmen had shrunk. Survivors' groups wanted to find all of them so their stories would not be lost.\n\nA woman from Illinois drew Bruner's name. No one among the groups knew where he was or what he was doing, but the woman persisted. She tracked him to the Los Angeles area, then started a phone search.\n\nFinally, she located some of Bruner's tax records and found his address and telephone number.\n\n\"No one knew where the hell I was,\" Bruner says. \"I was here all the time. When they sent me my discharge, I just stayed here.\"\n\nThe woman helped connect Bruner with other survivors from the Arizona and Pearl Harbor. He finally found people who understood his experience.\n\n\"I never talked about it much then,\" he says. \"I just didn't want to. I still get to the point when I'm talking about it, first thing you know, I go to bed at night, wake up and can't sleep for a week.\"\n\nBruner, who turned 94 in November, is now one of nine living USS Arizona crewmen who survived the ship's sinking. He has been telling his story to an author, Ed McGrath, who is working on a book and a film about Bruner's escape from a collapsing tower on the ship.\n\nThe survivors' group that found him was right, he has concluded: The stories of the Arizona should not die with the men who lived them.\n\n\"The kids coming up now have never heard of it,\" he says, his voice tinged with sadness and dismay. \"Never heard of it.\"\n\nBruner was at his battle station in an anti-aircraft gun director, a metal box on the forward mast of the Arizona, when an armor-piercing bomb ignited the ship's powder magazine. The fireball from the explosion engulfed the six men in the box and trapped them.\n\nA sailor on the deck of the repair ship Vestal spotted the men and threw a line across. Their skin charred and falling off, the men crawled down the line to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the sinking ship.\n\nHe won't talk much about the escape, or about the men who didn't make it across. Nightmares invade his sleep when he remembers those final moments.\n\nFrom the Vestal, Bruner was taken to the USS Solace, a hospital ship in the harbor. The Solace dispatched motor boats to the Arizona to rescue wounded sailors and her crew pulled others from the water.\n\nBruner was burned over more than two-thirds of his body. He had taken a bullet to the back of his leg as he was climbing the tower, but the burns were far worse. He stayed aboard the Solace about a month. In January, another ship took him to San Francisco to the Navy hospital on Treasure Island.\n\nHe was treated there for four months. Before the war started, a hospital stay that long would have earned a sailor a discharge, but not anymore. He knew he was near release the day an officer came by and launched into a pep talk about the war and the Navy's role in it.\n\n\"I got another ship for you,\" the officer said at last.\n\n\"OK,\" Bruner said. \"What's up with this one?\"\n\n\"It's a brand new destroyer, the Coghlan, DD-606,\" he said, \"built right here in 'Frisco.\"\n\nAs the war with Japan intensified, the Navy was building new warships as fast as it could. And the ships needed experienced sailors.\n\nBruner was put in charge of the gun batteries. The ship carried four 5-inch anti-aircraft guns and six half-inch machine guns, and, initially, five 21-inch torpedo tubes. The guns used the same type of control mechanisms Bruner had mastered on the Arizona. Sight-setters and pointers would locate targets visually and determine their distance and range. An electro-mechanical computer would aim the guns.\n\n\"I had to start training the new recruits on every machine,\" Bruner said. \"The new ones, they didn't know beans.\"\n\nBruner looked each recruit in the eyes to determine the right job, but he wasn't testing their mettle, not yet. He wanted men with eyes set in the right place on their face. He looked for what he called medium spacing. With eyes too close or two far apart, a crewman could deliver faulty readings.\n\nThe Coghlan left San Francisco in September 1942 and sailed toward Pearl Harbor for an assignment. The ship was still a day away from Honolulu when the captain received new orders. The ship was to turn around and steam toward Alaska.\n\nThe Japanese military had established strategic outposts in the Aleutian Islands and had its eye on Alaska. Japan wanted the northern Pacific to control its shipping routes and block U.S. attacks from that direction.\n\nThe Coghlan approached the Aleutians in October, as winter was pushing fall aside. The sea turned rough, tossing the ship with 40-foot swells, bouncing the vessel like a rubber ball in a washing machine.\n\n\"When we got up into the Aleutians, we started banging on the Japanese that had already landed,\" Bruner said. \"We'd patrol at night. They were trying to replenish submarines or send smaller ships in. We'd go out and blow them up.\"\n\nBy winter, temperatures plunged below zero. The Coghlan's crew battled just to keep the guns free of ice as they headed toward their next target.\n\n\"We had to have two crews, a regular crew and a stand-by crew lined up waiting,\" Bruner said. \"We'd send two guys out to knock the icicles off the guns, then they'd high-tail it back in. By the time they were back, the icicles were forming again and two more guys would go out.\"\n\nThe Coghlan supported Army landings and Navy bombing runs. In March, the crew turned back Japanese forces in the Battle of Komandorski.\n\nLate in the year, after an overhaul in San Francisco, the Coghlan returned to patrol duty off the Aleutians with a half dozen other U.S. vessels. The ships encountered a Japanese fleet, two big cruisers, six destroyers, some troop ships, and engaged.\n\n\"We lit into them, started firing on them,\" Bruner said. \"This went on for four straight hours. We got into a run-and-gun battle. One of our cruisers, the heavy cruiser, got hit and water got into the oil. They were dead in the water.\"\n\nFinally, the four U.S. destroyers were ordered to mount a torpedo run.\n\n\"We took off,\" Bruner said, \"firing just as fast as we could. We got as close as 5,000 yards, which was point-blank for those ships. We cut the torpedoes loose.\"\n\nThe Americans stopped the Japanese ships and wiped out some of the top officers. The Coghlan turned back, almost spent. Another five minutes, Bruner figured, and they'd have run out of ammunition.\n\nBruner and the Coghlan returned to Honolulu and finished out the war in the South Pacific. The ship accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines and was anchored in the harbor off Nagasaki, Japan, when the second atomic bomb exploded.\n\nBruner toured Nagasaki in a Jeep with other Navy officers and chief mates. A few days later, the drove through the crumbling streets of Hiroshima. The cities were in ruins. But the war was over.\n\n\"When I got back home, my doctors here wanted to know about my medical background,\" Bruner said. \"I would tell them. They said, 'You should have been dead a long time ago.'\"\n\nHe finished his stint in the Navy in Shanghai, working shore patrol the way he did back in Honolulu. He was cut loose in San Francisco and returned to Los Angeles, where he had married a girl back in late 1942.\n\nOne day, a young fellow knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself. \"I'm planning to marry your wife's sister, but I've got to have somebody take my place at work. I wanted to know if you could do it for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nBruner thought it an odd request. He asked what the fellow did.\n\n\"I'm a painter,\" he said. \"A brush painter.\"\n\nBruner laughs as he remembers the conversation.\n\n\"Well, I'd brushed enough paint on that damn ship, I figured I could do it,\" he says. \"I said, 'sure, I'll take it.' I still had to wait 29 years for that guy to come back and take his brush back.\"\n\nHis new employer manufactured industrial refrigeration units. Bruner started as a painter, trained as a carpenter, then helped start a new sheet-metal department. Almost three decades later, he was the plant manager, second-in-command.\n\nThree months before he would mark 30 years with the company, he was let go, bought out like a lot other older workers in those days.\n\nBy the time the woman from Illinois found him, he was ready to face his past.\n\nBruner lives alone , in a post-war neighborhood in the far northern edges of Orange County. Trains run close enough to hear the horns during the day, but not close enough to make them a nuisance.\n\nAn avocado tree grows in the backyard. Bruner's neighbor, who has become a close friend and a source of transportation, picks the fruit to keep it from rotting on the ground. Long a bachelor again, Bruner has also entertained lady friends from time to time.\n\nBruner keeps mementos of his time on the Arizona in the sitting room. Framed medals. Photos of the ship and other survivors at reunions in Honolulu. A sign over the arched door marks the room as \"Captain's Quarters.\"\n\nFor a long time, he didn't think he would ever return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nNow, Bruner prepares for his next trip in the Captain's Quarters. He will meet three other survivors in Hawaii for their last reunion. He looks forward to his time with the guys from his years in the Navy.\n\nThe first couple of trips back to Hawaii were difficult. The ones after that were, too.\n\n\"It never gets easy to go back,\" he says.\n\nSo why go back?\n\n\"To see the people I knew back in those days,\" he says. \"They were very good days before the war. I even had a couple of dates with girls.\"\n\nHis mouth quirks into a smile.\n\n\"I was on a date on that Saturday night with a gal I'd been running around with,\" he says. He doesn't need to say which Saturday night by now. \"We're were out and around. We were going to have a date the next day.\n\n\"The next day never came.\"\n\nMORRIS, Okla.\n\n\n\nLonnie Cook was born in this rural town south of Tulsa, not long after it was founded as a stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway. Only a few hundred people lived there then. Today, the population can almost reach 1,500 when everyone is home.\n\nCook enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and was assigned to the USS Arizona, one of the largest battleships in the fleet with a crew that, at full complement, numbered more than 1,500.\n\nAbout a year after he boarded the ship, he ran into a young recruit named Clyde Williams, a fellow from Okmulgee, Okla., a few miles down the road from Morris. All those sailors from all those places and here was a guy who was practically a neighbor.\n\n\"I was back here on leave before the war started and he was here too,\" Cook says. \"We picked up a couple of girls and made the rounds. Then we had to go back.\"\n\nCook was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Williams was in the Arizona's band.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Cook was changing clothes at his locker, savoring the thought of a day in Honolulu with the $60 he'd won in a craps game the night before. Williams was on deck, tuning up to play for colors, an early call after the previous day's fleet Battle of the Bands on shore.\n\nMinutes later, the Japanese attacked and the Arizona was on fire, sinking beneath the surface.\n\nCook made it off alive. He returned after the war to his home along the railway in eastern Oklahoma. By then, he'd seen the world, witnessed history before it was history. His ships steamed across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal to Africa. He fought with other sailors in the Battle of Midway and watched the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nBack on land, Cook followed welding jobs from Kentucky and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and Long Island, west to North Dakota and Wisconsin and finally to a ranch house in Salinas, Calif., where he raised a family and stayed put for almost 30 years.\n\nBut one day and one place in Cook's 94 years seem to embody all the rest, the day in December 1941 when the young sailor from Oklahoma escaped the ship that sent America to war.\n\nSeven decades later, he is one of nine living survivors from the Arizona. His story is always in demand, though he'd just as soon not tell it in front of a lot of people. He remembers all the details and most of what happened later.\n\nAnd he still likes to talk about that other young fellow from Oklahoma, the one who didn't make it home.\n\nWhen he left Morris the first time in 1939 after high school, Cook wasn't sure where he'd end up. Jobs were few, so he set off for Warner, Okla, with the idea of playing football at Connors State Agricultural College.\n\n\"They told me the team was already picked,\" he said. \"I said goodbye and left.\"\n\nHis mother suggested Hills Business College in Oklahoma City. He enrolled, but after a couple of weeks, the noisy streetcars and the police sirens kept him up all night.\n\n\"I went back and told my mother I wasn't going up there anymore,\" he said.\n\nBy April 1940, the Navy seemed like a good idea and by summer, he was on board the Arizona, stationed at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nHe was assigned a battle station in the No. 3 gun turret. His job was to put the primer in the big 14-inch gun. Other crewmen would roll out the shell, use a mechanical device to ram it in, then load four bags of powder behind it. The primer went in last, before the end of the gun was sealed shut.\n\n\"From down inside, it wasn't too bad when they fired it,\" Cook said. \"It was like a hard jolt.\"\n\nCook made it to his battle station on Dec. 7, 1941, but the Arizona was moored in a cramped harbor and couldn't have fired the big guns even in a prolonged assault. Cook and the other men stayed below deck until the smoke from a fire forced them to leave.\n\nThe bomb that shattered the Arizona's bow exploded as Cook and the others climbed out of the turret. He stepped off the deck into a motor launch as the ship was sinking.\n\nThe next morning, the Arizona was still burning as oil flowed out of her full tanks. No one seemed to be in charge on Ford Island, where Cook had spent the night. He met up with some of the guys from the turret crew and they hopped a boat to shore, where there was a call for volunteers to join the Navy's destroyers.\n\n\"We said we'd volunteer if they'd put two or three of us together on the same ship,\" he said. \"They agreed.\"\n\nCook was assigned to the USS Patterson, then two months later, transferred to the Aylwin, a destroyer that had been moored at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 and engaged the bombers as the attack began.\n\nIn February, the Aylwin was part of a U.S. task force preparing for a raid on a Japanese base at Raubal, on the island of New Britain near Australia. Enemy patrol planes spotted the ships and the raid was canceled. As the ships turned around, a squadron of enemy bombers appeared. The ships sent up their own planes and turned back the assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Aylwin joined a task force in the Coral Sea with the USS Lexington, one of the Navy's early aircraft carriers. On the morning of May 8, the fighting intensified as American aircraft tried to turn back the enemy planes.\n\nJapanese torpedo bombers hit the Lexington and crippled the big ship. Explosions rocked the vessel and fires burned into the evening. The crew was evacuated and another U.S. destroyer scuttled the Lexington to keep the Japanese from capturing her.\n\nYears later, at a reunion in Tucson, Cook learned that one of his buddies from the Arizona had been sent to the Lexington and was in the Coral Sea when the carrier was attacked. He had settled in New Mexico with his family.\n\nCook got the buddy's telephone number and tried to call him. The buddy wasn't home, but his son-in-law answered.\n\n\"Can you tell me what ship did he go on after the Arizona?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"The Lexington,\" the son-in-law said.\n\n\"Was he on it when it sunk?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was.\"\n\nCook never got a chance to catch up with his buddy, but marveled at the connections he seemed to make from his short stint aboard the Arizona.\n\nA month after the Coral Sea battle, Cook's ship was part of the American forces in the critical Battle of Midway. After that, he steamed north to Kodiak, Alaska, where other Navy ships were trying to turn back Japanese inroads throughout the strategically important Aleutian Islands.\n\nBefore the year was out, Cook was sent to gunnery school in Washington, D.C., and to the South Boston Navy Yard, where he joined the new destroyer Pringle on its shakedown cruise.\n\nAbout halfway through the cruise, the Pringle was ordered to accompany the battleship Iowa to Africa, where President Roosevelt was to attend a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Morocco.\n\nDuring the conference, the Pringle sailed into the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in a river. One day, some smaller boats sailed past. One of the men started yelling.\n\n\"Is there anybody there from Oklahoma?\"\n\nThere were: Cook and another crewman. The man in the boat was from Muskogee, a town about 40 miles east of Morris.\n\nLonnie and Marietta Cook met in Morris after the war, but the road to their home here today winds thousands of miles across the country.\n\nCook was discharged in 1948 in San Diego and stuck around California, where he worked as a metal finisher at Van Nuys manufacturing plant. That didn't last long and he headed back to Morris, where he met Marietta.\n\nShe likes the story of how they tied the knot. He tries to abbreviate it: \"We went to California and got married.\"\n\n\"Tell them the rest,\" Marietta prompts.\n\n\"She went to California and I followed her,\" Lonnie says.\n\nMarietta shakes her head. \"He called me one night and said if you won't let me come to California, I found a lady who's got a new black Buick and I'm going to move to Texas.\"\n\n\"It was a new Mercury,\" Lonnie says.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, come on, then,'\" Marietta says, and in 1950, they wed.\n\nThat's where the cross-country adventures begin. Cook worked in California, mostly welding jobs, until the union he belonged to called a strike. He headed east and landed in Paducah, Ky. From there, he worked jobs in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and back to New York, where he welded 20-inch gas lines going through Brooklyn.\n\nHe returned to Oklahoma again and started his own business, outfitting a one-ton Ford pickup with a winch and other equipment that let him work the oil fields. A while later, he and Marietta were on the road again, to a missile base in Sturgess, S.D., to gas lines in Wisconsin and North Dakota.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Salinas, Calif., just inland from Monterey on the central coast. They bought a small ranch and, while Lonnie continued to work welding jobs, they grew walnuts, almonds, peaches, apples, nectarines, cherries and grapes.\n\n\"I canned 500 quarts of fruit one year,\" Marietta says. \"I really miss it.\"\n\nLonnie finally retired from welding in 1982 and in 1994, the Cooks moved back to Morris. Lonnie had taken up trap shooting and hoped to do a little hunting back home. It turned out little was the right word. He hasn't hunted in a while, though he still reloads his own ammunition on a garage workbench.\n\nAfter so many years of travel, the Cooks have settled into a more tranquil pace. They spoil their granddaughters and can now move on to a new great-granddaughter. Once a week, they motor on into Tulsa, where Marietta takes a china painting class and Lonnie wanders the aisles of sporting-goods stores.\n\nOccasionally, they head into Okmulgee for an evening out at the One Fire, a casino operated by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\nCook has returned to Pearl Harbor three times and he likes the Arizona memorial. It is respectful. He's not so fond of the crowds around Honolulu and doesn't plan to go back.\n\nAs he talks about Pearl Harbor again, other memories surface.\n\nCook was the gun captain on the Pringle at the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. The ship provided fire support for the Marines going ashore. Cook stood on a shelf in the gun mount with his big binoculars and watched the Marines raise the flag to mark the U.S. victory.\n\nAbout a month later, Japanese suicide bombers sunk the Pringle near Okinawa.\n\nDuring his voyage to Alaska, Cook remembers the flying fish, which stirred up the water like a torpedo wake. That was enough to rattle nerves on board the ship, which was at general quarters every day an hour before sundown and an hour before sunrise.\n\n\"The nights up there were already short, so I didn't get much sleep,\" Cook says. \"That's what I'm catching up now. When she says anything, I tell her I'm catching up from the war.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Cooks attended a fund-raising dinner at a local American Legion post. Cook is invited to such events occasionally and sometimes introduced as an Arizona survivor.\n\nAt this one, he was looking around the room and he saw a picture of a sailor way back in the back, in a setting arranged like a memorial. He squinted and thought about where he was.\n\n\"That must be old Clyde Williams,\" he thought, the Arizona band member killed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe walked back there. Sure enough.\n\nIt was Clyde.\n\nROSWELL, N.M.\n\nHis name was Cactus Jack and to his fans in southeastern New Mexico, he was the dulcet-voiced host of Sagebrush Serenade, a program of country music on KSWS radio.\n\nHe was in the studio on Valentine's Day 1955 when a nervous young man walked in. He was the opening act for country superstar Hank Snow that night at the North High School auditorium. He had a record, a new song he was trying out.\n\n\"Would you like to listen to it?\" the young man asked.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Sure, let's see it.\" He put the disc on a turntable and dropped the needle.\n\nWhat he heard wasn't quite country music, but he liked it and he told the kid. Song's got some zip to it, he said. He agreed to play it on his show.\n\nThe song, \"Hound Dog\" and the singer, Elvis Presley, both went over pretty well, the way Cactus Jack remembers it.\n\nFor a lot of people, meeting Elvis and playing one of his first records on the air might sound like one of life's truly unforgettable days. But John Anderson, the Navy chief petty officer who called himself Cactus Jack on the air, had a good head start already.\n\nHe had chased Japanese soldiers along the coast of China three years before America declared war on Japan. In World War II, he fought at Guadalcanal, in the battle of the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. He fought cold and hunger on a ship nearly dead in the ocean off Alaska.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a stuntman for Orson Welles and John Wayne and helped build Alan Ladd's house in the hills outside Hollywood.\n\nAnd he was aboard on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment in history, but one that struck Anderson to his core. There, he lost his twin brother\n\n\"It was a bloody catastrophe, a bloody mess,\" he says. \"I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw that day.\"\n\nAnderson always talks about his brother, Delbert \"Jake\" Anderson, when he tells the story of his own escape from the burning ship.\n\nHe is one of nine living survivors of the Arizona and, at 97, he has amassed a lifetime of unforgettable days.\n\nAnderson grew up in the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota, the son of a prominent local judge. He had five brothers, including Jake, and four sisters, all grouped so close in age that paying for college wasn't practical for their folks.\n\nAs a youngster, Anderson heard stories about the Navy from his uncle, a man named Ray Stokes. Uncle Ray was nearing the end of his career in 1937 when John and Jake both decided to enlist.\n\nJohn was sent from training camp in Illinois to Bremerton, Wash. He was assigned briefly to the Arizona, then to the Saratoga, an aircraft carrier, then, as the Navy tinkered once more with its troop alignment, back to the Arizona.\n\nBefore the big battleship could leave Puget Sound, Anderson volunteered for another mission, joining the small Asiatic Fleet along the coast of China.\n\nAnderson went aboard the USS Edsall, a destroyer that supported various military action at sea and ashore. Japan and China were at war again and America was trying to protect its interests without getting involved in the conflict.\n\n\"We saved people on commercial ships on the seas, we rescued missionaries in the interior of China, we shot up a bunch of pirates,\" Anderson said.\n\nAt Kulangsu, an international settlement on an island off the southern Chinese coast, Anderson's unit ran into the French Foreign Legion, who had been cornered by Japanese soldiers on a high ridge.\n\n\"I'd never seen so many guys with so much guts,\" he said. \"They were holed up behind sandbags, but they never got hit.\"\n\nThe Edsall sailed farther north, then headed to the Philippines, where they played baseball with a group of indigenous Moros, who had fought the United States more than 20 years earlier.\n\n\"We were told to watch out for them, these guys were assassins,\" Anderson said. \"We made friends. We left and never fired a shot at them.\"\n\nIn 1940, Anderson reported to the Arizona once more, joining his brother for the first time since they had enlisted. They would serve together for a little over a year.\n\nThe day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anderson volunteered for duty on the Macdonough, a destroyer that downed at least one of the Japanese attack planes on Dec. 7.\n\nThe ship steamed toward the Asiatic Pacific and soon Anderson was chasing Japanese forces again, only this time the United States was at war. This time the objective was clear.\n\nThat summer, the ship joined others for the invasion at Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, one of the first major assaults against Japan by the Americans. The Macdonough stayed until September, then sailed back on patrol in the Pacific.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Macdonough headed north toward the Aleutian Islands, where Japan was trying to establish strategic strongholds that could control shipping lanes and thwart allied attacks on the Japanese islands.\n\n\"It was rough weather, foggy, raining cold,\" Anderson said. \"Here we are, we can't see the enemy. We can't see our own ships. Then we got hit.\"\n\nThe Macdonough had collided with another destroyer, the Sicard. The ship was dead in the water. The crew unloaded anything they could do without, to keep the damaged hull above the water line. They knew the oil tanker Tippecanoe was out there, but couldn't see her.\n\nFinally, the tanker spotted the destroyer. Anderson spoke to one of the tanker's crew about towing the Macdonough. The fellow he was talking with recognized Anderson's voice and they realized they had served together on the Yangtze Patrol before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe tanker towed them to Adak, Alaska, and from there, another ship took the crippled destroyer to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nOver the next year, Anderson would sail across the South Pacific, joining other ships in the American assault on the Marshall Islands, Parry Island and the Palau Islands. The Macdonough pulled picket patrol often, protecting other troops and guarding against kamikaze attacks by Japanese planes.\n\n\"We made so many landings,\" Anderson said. \"We would go in with a landing party or we furnished artillery for the landing force. Sometimes we never landed, but we kept the line, always watching out for kamikazes.\"\n\nOn a fall day in 1945, John Anderson teetered on the base of a church steeple 110 feet above the ground. The steeple clock chimed and a statue of an angel wielding a sword emerged from an alcove and knocked Anderson off the steeple.\n\n\"Cut!\" a director yelled. A stunt coordinator helped pull Anderson from the pile of cigarette crates that had broken his fall. Anderson had finished his first day as a Hollywood stunt man.\n\nThe job wasn't what he expected in September, when he was discharged from the Navy. He had a ticket home to Minnesota, but decided to find a place to stay and come up with a plan.\n\nAs he walked past a bar, still in his Navy uniform, a fellow popped out the door and looked Anderson up and down, checking him out more closely someone would ordinarily.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Anderson demanded to know.\n\n\"You,\" the fellow said. \"Are you in the Navy?\"\n\n\"I was,\" Anderson said. \"I just got discharged. The war's over.\"\n\n\"Would you like a job?\" The fellow told him to report to the front gate of Sam Goldwyn's studio in Hollywood on Monday morning. He gave Anderson the name of a contact there.\n\nAnderson decided he had nothing to lose. After an initial run-in with the guard at the gate (\"Three weeks ago, I was shooting at people and killing them and I didn't even know who they were,\" he growled at the guard. \"You I know.\") he met his contact and not long after, he was standing in for Orson Welles in a scene from the movie \"The Stranger.\"\n\nIt turned out most of the regular stuntmen were still in the military. The studios needed tough men who could handle dangerous situations. The job paid $700.\n\n\"Next thing you know, I'm in a movie with John Wayne,\" Anderson says years later. \"I didn't have any speaking parts, but I was working for the studio and they paid me.\"\n\nHe got to know Alan Ladd, who had starred in a series of war movies. When the regular stuntmen returned and the studio cut loose the subs, Ladd hired some of them to work on his house in the Holmby Hills above Los Angeles.\n\nAt nights, Anderson was taking classes in meteorology and electronics, trying to learn skills that could help him stand out among all the returning servicemen and women.\n\nOne day, he stopped for coffee at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. He felt a tap on his shoulder. He saw Gene LaRocque, a man he'd served with aboard the Macdonough.\n\n\"Are you out of the Navy, Andy?\" LaRocque asked. When Anderson said he was, his old friend was incredulous. \"Andy, you had 12 years of the damnedest fighting I ever saw. You're the bravest man I ever know. You can't leave the Navy.\"\n\nLaRocque took Anderson to San Pedro, where his current ship was anchored. He introduced him to other officers. By the end of the day, had persuaded Anderson to sign up for the Navy Reserve. Put in eight years at least and you'll have a pension, he promised.\n\nAnderson would serve another 23 years before finally retiring once more.\n\nAnderson's road to the radio booth started in Hollywood, with a screen test at a studio where he had worked. He waited for the result. You have a great voice, he was told. Why not try radio?\n\nSo he did. He started on a small station, playing organ music. An administrator at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, N.M., heard Anderson and talked him into joining the school to help improve its radio station and start a television station.\n\nAnderson picked up and moved to New Mexico. He clashed with the station manager of the radio station and finally quit. Or got fired. Or both. That led to a job in Roswell, the Sagebrush Serenade and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"They played country music because the people here loved that,\" Anderson says. \"Some of the ships I was on had guys who liked to play the guitar, so I knew something about it. The owner said, 'give it a name and say who are. Anything you choose is fine. You're on your own, every day.'\"\n\nAs Cactus Jack, Anderson made a few concessions to his seagoing past.\n\n\"I cleaned up my language,\" he says, admitting he deployed a salty vocabulary, even after leaving active duty. \"In the service, if you didn't use nasty words, you weren't a good sailor.\"\n\nA few years later, a new station owner showed Anderson his plans to start a TV station. He said he wanted Anderson to join the on-air staff. Did he know anything about meteorology?\n\nAnderson smiled. Did he ever. Soon, he became one of the earliest TV weathermen and an evening fixture in Roswell homes, or at least those with televisions.\n\nNot long after he returned to Pearl Harbor near the end of the war, Anderson searched out some of the battle reports from Dec. 7, 1941. He knew his brother hadn't made it off the Arizona alive, but he didn't know much else.\n\nHe found a report by a gunner's mate. The report said most of the guys in the anti-aircraft batteries, where Jake fought, were shot down early in the assault. When the fourth bomb detonated in the powder magazine, anyone left was blown over the side.\n\nAnderson has returned to the Arizona memorial often and has taken his family there. He has met many of his old friends and shipmates. Many have since died.\n\n\"It's always a great thing for me to see them,\" he says. \"That's what I want to remember. The things I don't want to remember was the blood.\"\n\nAlthough he is 97, he decided he couldn't miss a final reunion this year and he bought his tickets early. He wanted one last unforgettable day.\n\nUPDATE: John Anderson died in November 2015, less than a year after this report.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n\n\n\nDonald Stratton completed the paperwork for a concealed weapons permit at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and approached the counter to submit fingerprints.\n\nHe was still adjusting to his new life in Colorado, hundreds of miles inland from his old home in coastal California and more than a mile higher in elevation. He had turned 90 and was starting over again.\n\nAs he waited, he had a feeling he knew what would happen, but he didn't say anything. A clerk tried to complete the process, normally a routine, if messy, step to secure the permit. She returned, puzzled.\n\nThey were having trouble reading his prints, she told Stratton. It was as if he had none.\n\nStratton hesitated, then confirmed her suspicion. His fingers were almost smooth, lacking all but a few of the swirls that create an identity.\n\nStratton told her why: He had been aboard the USS Arizona when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. He survived, but was burned badly over two-thirds of his body. Doctors treated him and he recovered, but the his fingers never healed properly.\n\nThe clerks decided they could not send Stratton away without his permit. They found a way to take prints from the edges of his fingers, enough to satisfy the law.\n\nAs he recounts the experience, he rubs his hands together, then holds them out, turning them over. He pushes his shirtsleeves up to show his arms. He motions toward his gnarled ear. He catalogs the scars and their origin.\n\nThey are the marks of a survivor, 73 years on. They are reminders of a moment in time he can never escape, a moment he sees again and again.\n\n\"Through all that, I never did lose consciousness,\" he says. \"I knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nAs the USS Arizona burned and sunk into the harbor, Stratton and five other men had been trapped on an anti-aircraft gun control platform on the ship's foremast, burned in a fireball when below-deck ammunition exploded.\n\nA sailor on the repair ship Vestal, tied up nearby, spotted them and threw them a line. The men, their charred skin peeling away, climbed hand-over-hand across the line to safety.\n\nStratton and other men climbed into a small boat that took them ashore. They still had to climb onto the dock and then into a truck for a short ride to a Navy hospital. The burn ward filled with the injured. The smell of burned skin filled the air. Doctors and nurses wove among gurneys, administering morphine shots and looking for the victims most in need.\n\nWithin a day or two, someone came into the ward and said a few of the wounded would be sent to California. He asked for volunteers.\n\n\"I'll go,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"No,\" the worker said. \"We don't think you'd make it. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"I want to go anyway,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"Fine,\" the worker said. \"If you can stand up and stay up while we change the linen on this bed, we'll see about it.\"\n\nStratton climbed to his feet and, biting back the pain, he stood and when his bed was ready, he collapsed back into it. By Christmas, he was in a hospital at Mare Island near San Francisco. He stayed there for months. He weighed 92 pounds by the time he was sent to rehabilitation in Corona, Calif. Finally, the Navy gave him a medical discharge.\n\nA year later, he felt better, so he re-enlisted. The Navy wanted to keep him in Idaho, working with new recruits at a boot camp, but he pushed for a seagoing assignment and wound up on the destroyer USS Stack as a gunner's mate.\n\nHe saw action across the South Pacific, patrolled areas where suicide bombers were attacking American destroyers. Once he was awakened by a loud noise and a flash and thought his ship was under attack.\n\nIt wasn't, but the flash was a reminder, as if he needed anything more.\n\nBefore the end of the war, he went to San Diego for gunner's mate school. He finished his training and was discharged in December 1945.\n\nStratton grew up in the tiny prairie town of Red Cloud, Neb., about as far away from an ocean as any place in the country. He joined the Navy because it seemed like a better environment.\n\n\"You either had a nice place aboard a ship and were high and dry or you didn't have anything,\" he reasoned. \"In the Army you were crawling around in the mud and everything else and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nAfter his second discharge, he knocked around Nebraska again, working in his dad's tavern, then on a beer truck, but he grew bored. He decided to head back to the water. In California, he earned his naval seaman's license and went to work on a drilling rig offshore near Santa Barbara.\n\nHe made bargemaster on a huge drilling rig, but yearned for something more interesting, so he got a job as a tender with a commercial deep sea diving business. As a tender, he stayed on the surface, monitoring the divers working on rigs, piers, pipelines, any piece of seaside or seagoing equipment.\n\nStratton logged thousands of miles of travel. Nicaragua. Chile. Colombia. Kuwait. In Alaska, he helped set up platforms that could keep up with tides that rose and fell as much as 32 feet.\n\nIn his dining room in Colorado Springs, he keeps a replica of a hard diving helmet, the kind his divers used. The face plate is glass and around the bottom are screws that would secure it to the diving suit. Stratton falls easily into the memories of his years on diving boats.\n\n\"We worked with a crane barge capable of lifting 700 tons,\" he sys. \"I motioned to crane operator what we needed, what tools to send down.\" He touches the diving helmet. \"I ran the decompression chamber on jobs. Once, I made a dive in a two-man submarine, down in over 1,200 feet of water off Santa Barbara coast. One of the first people to do that.\"\n\nFor years, Stratton wore the scars from the Arizona without talking about them much. Lots of men brought home scars from World War II and Korea. The offshore diving business could leave its own kind of scars.\n\nIn 1966, 25 years after the attack, Stratton returned to Pearl Harbor with his family. In the waters off Honolulu, he confronted his memories. It was the first time Randy, his son, had seen his father cry.\n\nIn the years after, he became active in survivors' groups and started going back to Pearl Harbor more often. At the USS Arizona memorial, he became friends with a National Park Service historian and inspired a Pearl Harbor action figure that the service sold at the gift shop.\n\nIn time, he felt no anger toward the Japanese, but he couldn't forget what they did. Sometimes, Japanese pilots attended memorial ceremonies and some of the other survivors would shake their hands. Stratton could not.\n\n\"Listen, all those men down there on that ship, a thousand of them, they wouldn't do it and I don't think they'd want me to do it,\" he says. \"We can't forget what happened there that day. We can't let it happen again.\"\n\nA while back, Stratton and his wife Velma retired to Yuma and lived there about 15 years. He played a lot of golf, but missed California. They moved to Santa Maria, not far from Santa Barbara, to be near their oldest son, then to Colorado Springs to be near Randy. They will celebrate 65 years of marriage in April.\n\nThe Stratton men have taken up a more personal cause. He wants to secure a proper medal for Joe George, the sailor from the Vestal who helped rescue the six men from the gunner's control tower.\n\nA lot of people agree that what George did was heroic, but the Navy balks at every step, in part because George disobeyed a direct order.\n\n\"He should have the Navy Cross,\" Stratton says. \"He saved six people's lives. Joe saved six lives and he didn't get crap. He refused to cut the line no matter what. As far he was concerned he was saving lives.\"\n\nIn 1971, Stratton was working long hours with a diving outfit on a nuclear power plant project not far from Santa Barbara. He needed a truck to carry equipment back and forth, so he scouted out a car lot and bought a 1965 Chevrolet pickup.\n\nHe kept the truck, held on to it through repairs, engine overhauls, new paint jobs. It sits today in the carport outside his home. He still tools around town in the truck, but it's a classic now, so he drives it almost as often to car shows.\n\nHe can tell stories about his years with the diving crews, but the truck has evolved into a reminder of another time. The license plate reads USS ARIZ. A mural on a white bed cover depicts the USS Arizona and the memorial that floats above it in Pearl Harbor. It identifies Stratton as a survivor of the attack that sank the ship.\n\nWherever he goes on the pickup, people ask him about his experience. Yes, he'll say, he was on the Arizona and he survived. Yes, a lot of brave men died. Yes, some of them were his friends.\n\nHe still remembers the day he saw the Arizona in dry dock at Bremerton, Wash.\n\n\"It was quite a sight for an old flatlander like me to see a 35,000-ton battleship out of the water,\" he says. \"It was a big ship with a lot of metal, I'll tell you.\" He owns a chunk of the ship's burned deck, a reminder he keeps in a box with a few other items.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Stratton ambles down the driveway and fires up the engine. He eases the truck out of the carport, far enough to show it off. He fiddles with the radio.\n\n\"Randy, come and turn on the music box.\" His son reaches in the cab and queues up one of the hundreds of songs he and his daughter downloaded onto the new MP3 player.\n\n\"Lots of big band songs,\" Randy says, as the first bars of a brass line pour from the speakers. \"The stuff he likes.\"\n\nHow lucky can one guy be?\n\nI kissed her and she kissed me\n\nStratton's eyes brighten. A smile spreads across his face as Dean Martin's voice fills the cab.\n\nLike a fella once said\n\nAin't that a kick in the head?\n\nThe smile widens. Almost imperceptibly, he sways.\n\nWEST WARWICK, R.I.\n\n\n\nThe six men stared straight ahead, almost as if they were back in line, at attention. They listened for their names and their service branch. They stayed composed as their stories were told, stories of bravery, of quick thinking. Stories of survival.\n\nEach of the six men were at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes swarmed the Navy fleet in an ambush that would provoke war. On the 70th anniversary of the attack, the men had been brought to the state capitol to receive new honors.\n\nAs each name was read, Rhode Island National Guard Maj. Gen. Kevin McBride presented the man with the Rhode Island Star, one of the state's highest military honors.\n\nWorld War II veterans are a special breed, Lt. Col. Denis Riel said as the men accepted the medals. Without them, Riel said, who knows where we'd be today.\n\nMcBride reached the last man, Raymond Haerry, a 20-year-old coxswain on the day of the assault. Haerry straightened in his seat as his story was told. He had escaped the USS Arizona, the battleship whose losses surpassed any other.\n\nFor Haerry, McBride had a the state's highest military honor, the Rhode Island Cross. Haerry accepted the medal, but found he could not speak. He handed the microphone to his son, Raymond Haerry, Jr., who spoke of his father's courage and resilience.\n\nThree years later, Ray Haerry Jr. holds the cross in his hand, fighting back tears.\n\n\"I hadn't told him he was going to be individually honored that day,\" he says. \"I had to help my father out of his seat. He stood strong and tall right in front of this general. I heard the general say, 'You're a remarkable guy.' I think it was one of the proudest days of my father's life.\"\n\nHis dad has never sought recognition for his service on the Arizona and barely talks about the day of the attack. He will tell his story to people he knows well and trusts, but he is 93 and the details are fading from his memory.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of six Rhode Islanders who had lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor, the only one from the Arizona. Today, he is one of nine remaining survivors from the mighty battleship.\n\n\"I do as much as I can to keep his story alive,\" his son says. \"It's always been my fear that people are going to forget that day, that people are going to forget the sacrifice that was made that day.\"\n\nHaerry ran away from home to join the Navy. He grew up in New Jersey and after high school, enrolled at MIT in Boston. He was smart enough to excel, but started cutting classes not long after the start of his first semester.\n\nHe and a buddy would sneak off campus and hop freight trains to see how far they could get. He missed enough of his classes that he was finally asked to leave. As soon as he turned 18, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nOn the Arizona, he worked on the deck crew. He cleaned and painted day after day, but he also operated the motor boats used to ferry crew members to shore, a job that let him leave the ship periodically.\n\nHaerry had made two runs to shore on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. It was Sunday and some of the crewmen with liberty wanted an early start. He was eating breakfast when he heard the first pops of the attack planes strafing Battleship Row.\n\nHe ran to the anti-aircraft battery, his battle station, but there was no ammunition ready. He could see the planes were flying too low for his guns anyway, but before his crew could figure out their next move, an armor-piercing bomb detonated near the powder magazine beneath the No. 2 gun turret.\n\nHaerry felt the entire ship life out of the water. As it fell, he was thrown from the ship into the harbor. He half-swam, half-walked the 70 yards to Ford Island and manned a mounted machine gun. He spent the rest of the day retrieving bodies from the harbor.\n\n\"He remembers body parts in the water, charred burned bodies that he swam by,\" his son Ray, Jr., says. \"Something had happened that no one could comprehend.\"\n\nHaerry sailed on Navy ships through World War II and again during the Korean conflict. He spent long months on a tender, a vessel that carries equipment, parts and other supplies for ships at sea.\n\nOn one mission, Haerry's tender was tied to a larger ship as the crew delivered supplies and completed maintenance tasks. The sky began to darken and the wind grew. A storm was approaching, a big one by the looks of it.\n\nThe tender didn't want to be tied to the larger ship when the worst of the storm blew through. High winds could slam one ship into the other and sink one or both of the vessels.\n\nHaerry held the rope that connected the ships as another crewman swung an ax to cut it. As the boat heaved, the man with the ax missed and hit Haerry's hand, nearly severing it from his wrist. He did not reach a hospital for several days, but doctors still saved his hand.\n\nA year after World War II ended, Haerry went home for a while and married a girl he'd met not long before. He and Evelyn had their first son, Ray, Jr., in 1947.\n\nFor a while, the young family lived in Puerto Rico as Haerry, now a chief boatswain's mate, drew new assignments aboard his tender.\n\n\"He was out to sea nine months out of the year, only home for three months,\" Ray Jr. says. \"He was very military by then, very disciplined.\"\n\nAfter he returned from Korea, Haerry was promoted to master chief petty officer, signifying his experience and level of service. He had turned down a promotion to ensign, preferring the camaraderie of the enlisted ranks.\n\nAt his request, he was assigned to the officer candidate school in Newport, R.I. He left home at 5 every morning and took a ferry from Jamestown to the Navy base. He liked teaching and liked the chance to instill discipline.\n\n\"I've gotten letters from some of the officer candidates who had my father as an instructor,\" Ray Jr. says. \"They said he was a tough bastard, but that's exactly what they needed.\"\n\nHis service on the Arizona also seemed to give him added credibility among the young sailors. They respected a guy who survived such a horrific attack.\n\nThere was a tradition at the end of training that the graduates would give the chief a silver dollar. Haerry would come home on those days with cigar boxes full of the coins.\n\nFor a long time, Haerry never talked about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He displayed no pictures, kept no mementos that his family knew about. He would answer questions, but in short bursts of description, with no emotion.\n\n\"The only people he would talk to were either very close friends or relatives,\" his son says. \"He'd always have to be prompted.\"\n\nIt took Ray Jr. years, decades to piece together his father's story. He would draw out snippets and stash them away, collecting them until he would weave the barest narrative.\n\nAs anniversaries of the attack passed, Ray Jr. would asked his dad if he wanted to visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor.\n\nNope. He wanted to part of it. He's never been back.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Ray Jr. says. \"To go through that to me is incomprehensible. Nobody was expecting anything like that.\"\n\nHis dad will return finally at his death. Ray Jr. has arranged for his father's remains to be interred in the sunken Arizona, an honor accorded any of the sailors or Marines who survived the attack.\n\nThree years ago, Ray Jr. received a call from a lieutenant colonel in the Rhode Island National Guard. He told Ray about the plans to honor Pearl Harbor survivors at the statehouse. One of the survivors would receive the Rhode Island Cross.\n\nAs they talked, Ray mentioned that his dad had been aboard the Arizona. That caught the lieutenant colonel's interest. He called back a few days later.\n\n\"We found our guy,\" he told Ray Jr.\n\nFive years ago, Haerry moved into a nursing home, He stays in a room on the second floor. Thickets of tangled shrubs and rows of trees are visible from his window.\n\nThe nurse who checks in on him regularly likes Haerry. She prods him to move around more and to leave the room for meals. He has told her about his escape from the Arizona.\n\nRay Jr. seems surprised. \"He told you the story?\" She nods and smiles.\n\nHaerry accepts the chocolate bars his son has brought him. He likes chocolate and is disappointed if Ray Jr. forgets it. There are a few personal photos on the table, but nothing from his years in the Navy.\n\nExcept the cap. The USS Arizona ballcap that almost every survivor owns and wears.\n\nHe doesn't want to answer questions about his war service, shrugging them off or insisting he can't remember the details anymore. But he clutches the cap and puts it on as he sits in an easy chair by the window.\n\n\"These guys were the first heroes of the war, even though the war hasn't been declared,\" Ray Jr. says. \"I think my dad was one of the first American heroes of World War II.\"\n\nHe and his father chat a little. Haerry says he wants lunch delivered to his room, but the nurse says no. You need the exercise. Haerry nods and like a good sailor taking orders from the chief, he pulls himself up with a walker and shuffles off to lunch.\n\nYUBA CITY, Calif.\n\nJoe Langdell found a table in the wardroom of one of the ships moored in Pearl Harbor and sat down with his breakfast.\n\nThree days had passed since Japanese bombers had punched a fiery hole in the Navy's Pacific fleet. Three days since the war started.\n\nCrippled ships still floated around the mooring posts along Ford Island. Repair crews were already at work on the battleships that had survived. Salvage work would begin soon on others. Sailors found food and shelter wherever they could.\n\nLangdell's ship, the USS Arizona, lay dead in the water where she sank 14 minutes into the attack. The mast and towers near the bow tilted at a sickening angle. Fire had blackened much of the structure still visible.\n\nLangdell heard someone enter the room.\n\n\"Are there any officers from the Arizona here?\" he said.\n\nLangdell was an ensign, an entry-level officer, not yet a year in the Navy. He was nervous about volunteering for anything, but he raised his hand.\n\nThe man walked over and looked at Langdell's name tag.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell,\" he said, \"when you're done with your breakfast, you'll report to the pier and you'll be met by a motor whale boat and a party of 20 enlisted men with sheets and pillow cases.\"\n\nWhat is this? Langdell thought.\n\n\"You will go to the Arizona and you will take off all the bodies and body parts above the water line,\" the man said. \"Cover the decks, anywhere you can find them up to the top of the masts.\"\n\n\"So that's what we did,\" he says, staring out at the harbor nearly seven decades later.\n\nLangdell is one of the last nine survivors from the Arizona. At 100, he is the oldest.\n\nHe was on Ford Island when the Japanese attacked, training for new assignment. His own battle station was beneath the gun turret shattered by the last bomb to hit the Arizona. From the shore, he helped wounded men from the water, men whose bodies had been torn apart by bombs and bullets and fire.\n\nBut he could not be prepared for what he found on the charred hulk of the battleship. He still will not talk about it. His younger son believes the experience changed his dad forever.\n\n\"How could it not?\" the son wonders.\n\nLangdell says only this: \"It took two days to take all the bodies. We carefully wrapped them in sheets. The body parts we put in pillow cases. We swept the decks and took the small bones. Everything was taken ashore and properly taken care of.\"\n\nLangdell arrived at Pearl Harbor along a different path than many of the young sailors, who signed up for the service because they were unable to find work as civilians.\n\nBorn in 1914, seven months after the first bolts were tightened on a new battleship in Brooklyn, Langdell grew up wooded agricultural area along the Souhegan River in southern New Hampshire.\n\nHis dad operated a livery stable and a small dairy and later earned money as an auctioneer. The family sold maple syrup distilled from the trees on their farm.\n\nAfter high school, Langdell enrolled at Boston University, working nights to pay for his classes, and in 1938, he earned a degree in business administration. He went to work as a junior accountant for a prominent Boston firm.\n\nBut he became restless. He signed up for a Navy program that allowed college graduates to attend officer candidate school and emerge as ensigns within three months. By early 1941, Langdell was one of the \"90-day wonders\" and drew his first assignment: The USS Arizona.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Langdell asked for a posting on one of the new destroyers the Navy was set to launch. He was soon aboard the USS Frazier, which left the shipyard at San Francisco in July 1942.\n\nThe Frazier patrolled the South Pacific at first, but in early 1943, steamed northward toward Alaska, where Japan was trying to secure positions in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOne day in May, crewmen spotted two periscopes in the water and the Frazier opened fire. The guns hit the periscope. Using its sonar equipment, the ship fired depth charges and eventually sank the enemy submarine.\n\nToward the end the war, Langdell was stationed in the Philippines, at a base in Manila. Among his responsibilities was overseeing the naval officers' clubs in the area.\n\nOne morning, he was at his desk, catching up on paperwork, when he heard a vehicle screech to a halt outside. A young sailor ran in, out of breath.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell, Mr. Langdell, you've got to come here quick,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Langdell asked.\n\n\"It's easier if you come see it,\" the sailor said.\n\nThey hopped in a Jeep and head up the hill toward one of the Quonset huts, the one where liquor for the officers' clubs was stored. As they walked toward it, Langdell reeled at an odor. Alcohol.\n\nInside, he found broken bottles scattered in a soggy soup of booze and cardboard. Someone had stacked the boxes too high and in the humid environment of the island, the cardboard had grown damp and weak.\n\nThe boxes had collapsed.\n\nLangdell was discharged at the war's end and returned to Massachusetts, where his wife, Libby, waited.\n\nJoe had met Elizabeth McGauhy in Chicago half a decade earlier. He was attending midshipman's school at Northwestern University. She was attending an art academy to learn dress designing. They met at a dance at the YWCA on North State Street.\n\nThey danced. They went out for coffee afterward. They continued to see each other and, when Langdell left for Hawaii, they corresponded, often.\n\nAs he prepared for his new posting on the Frazier, Langdell decided to make a move. He asked his brother, Ted, to visit Libby and see if she could cook. The report: Oh, yes, she can cook.\n\nJoe proposed and Libby accepted. They would be married in San Francisco, before the Frazier set sail. The only question was how Langdell would send Libby word about his arrival from Pearl Harbor. The Navy censors would never allow such information in a letter.\n\nLangdell knew Libby was friends with a skater in the Ice Follies, which was summering in San Francisco. He wrote Libby a letter and suggested it would be a good idea if Libby visited her friend on or about a particular date. Libby got the message.\n\nThey were married in an Episcopal Church on Van Ness Avenue. Langdell had borrowed a car, a Dusenburg, for the honeymoon. Libby had arranged stays north of the city. Friends told them when the left the church, keep the water on their left.\n\nWhat they didn't count on was the side-street parking. Langdell took a right turn instead of a left and the newlyweds didn't realize their mistake until they stopped for gas in Gilroy, about 80 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nThe Langdells ended up honeymooning in Monterey and Carmel on the central California coast.\n\nAfter the war, Langdell returned to the family auction business in Massachusetts, but after all those years in Hawaii, the Philippines and in the tropical South Seas, he couldn't readjust to the cold. He and Libby moved west to Walnut Creek east of San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually bought a home-furnishings outlet farther inland and finally built their own store in Yuba City, north of Sacramento. They ran Joe and Libby Langdell's Village Mart for more than 20 years until they retired.\n\nOccasionally, they would close the store and hook a 33-foot trailer to a pick-up truck. They traveled around the country, meeting up with other USS Arizona survivors, with shipmates from the Frazier. Keeping the memories alive.\n\nLangdell returned to Pearl Harbor in 1976. His oldest son had joined the Navy and his first posting was aboard the USS Ouellet, a frigate. The family visited the Arizona memorial and toured other sites near the harbor.\n\nBefore the trip, Langdell hadn't talked much about his years in the war, about his time on the Arizona. Afterward, Langdell sought out other survivors who had formed reunion organizations. He was active in those groups for many years, serving as president of one devoted to the Arizona.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the attack neared, Langdell got a call from a documentary filmmaker. He wanted to interview Langdell for his project. He was also interviewing a Japanese pilot named Zenji Abe, a pilot who had taken part in the raid on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Would Langdell agree to meet Abe on film?\n\nThe two men not only met, they took a boat to the USS Arizona memorial and laid a wreath in front of the wall with the names of the crewmen who died on the ship.\n\nIn the documentary, \"The Life and Death of a Lady,\" Langdell and Abe speak, side by side on the memorial. Abe offered condolences and said he prayed that all their souls were at peace.\n\nLangdell said much more.\n\n\"It is only by the grace of God that I stand here today,\" he said. \"I witnessed your attack from Ford Island. Helpless, I watched your bomb sink the Arizona in nine minutes.\"\n\nSentiment ran high against the Japanese, he said, but also against U.S. leaders whose decisions many questioned in the aftermath. He acknowledged the wreath.\n\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.\"\n\nIn 2006, Langdell walked along the steep shoreline of Ford Island, the Arizona memorial in the background. He told his story as his son, Ted, recorded it on video.\n\n\"The lesson I've learned from that experience is that the 1,177 men entombed on the ship right now will never know the love of a wife or the joy of grandchildren,\" he said. \"It's just not going to happen. We all have to remember that they did not die in vain.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Langdell celebrated his 100th birthday with with his older son, John, who flew in from Spearfish, S.D. On Veteran's Day, he participated once more in a parade through Marysville, the next town over from Yuba City. But he doesn't tell his story anymore, not on his own.\n\nLangdell lives now in a skilled nursing center. He has trouble remembering the past. He struggles to speak at times (though when he's feeling good, he likes to flirt with the nurses). He sits in his wheelchair as his son recites the narrative, keeping his father's story alive.\n\nPhotographs hang on the walls of his room. His wife, Libby, who died two years ago. His kids and grandkids. Pictures of past parades. A framed painting of the Arizona, the repair ship Vestal next to it.\n\nHe likes to wear a cap that identifies him as a veteran of the Arizona.\n\n\"Why do you like the hat, dad?\" Ted asks.\n\n\"It acknowledges to people that I'm a survivor,\" Joe replies, his voice soft. \"The hat represents the Arizona.\n\nTed asks him about the ship.\n\n\"The Arizona was a fighting battleship,\" Joe says. \"One of the last ones…\" He talks about going aboard the Frazier.\n\nLangdell will return to the Arizona once more. When he dies, his remains will be interred under the No. 4 gun turret, with the men who died there and survivors who had died since.\n\nA final tribute.\n\nUPDATE: Joe Langdell died in February 2015, months after this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/14/who-is-behind-nj-drone-sightings/76991754007/", "title": "'Drone sightings' prompt worries, but there may be an explanation", "text": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven’t been able to put people’s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings?\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don’t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n“Historically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,” the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n“The drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,” former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n“First, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,” New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere’s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings – and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it’s likely there’s aren’t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn’t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn’t identify was a drone.\n\n“After what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,” he said.\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven’t been able to corroborate “any of the reported visual sightings” — despite using “very sophisticated electronic detection technologies.”\n\n“The FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,” the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere’s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven’t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n“To be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,” a joint statement from the agencies said. “While there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don’t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n“Listen, I hope it’s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.” New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn’t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\n“Clearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,” he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It’s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you’re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that’s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n“If the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,” he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\n“I suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,” Direen said.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/entertainment/gallery/oscar-best-picture-winners", "title": "Here's every film that won the Oscar for best picture | CNN", "text": "\"It Happened One Night\" (1935): \"It Happened One Night\" was one of the great underdog winners.

Among them, a Facebook post claims, is a secret U.S. program that recruited Nazis.\n\nA modified version of the popular meme of Homer Simpson vanishing into a hedge depicts Simpson bearing a swastika on one shoulder and an arm extended in a Nazi salute. \"World War II: ends,\" reads the text above, which goes on to suggest former \"Nazi scientists\" subsequently shifted over to NASA, as illustrated by Simpson reemerging in a T-shirt emblazoned with the agency's distinctive logo and a red baseball cap with the America flag.\n\nThe sentiment within the comments seemed largely accepting of the claim.\n\n\"What was the alternative for them?\" asked one. \"Since herr fuhrer (sic) liked to shoot people...\"\n\n\"Art imitates life,\" wrote another sharing a GIF featuring images from the Marvel movie franchise of an evil Nazi scientist character and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Germany scientists recruited by U.S.\".\n\nUSA TODAY awaits comment from the Facebook user who posted the meme in the public group Official Flat Earth & Glove Discussion.\n\nOperation Paperclip\n\nIn 1945, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, a subcommittee established by the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was tasked with retrieving German scientists, doctors and engineers who were identified as intellectually vital to the Third Reich.\n\nJournalist Annie Jacobsen states in a 2014 interview that this was prompted by the Allies' concerns over Hitler's potential weapons arsenal.\n\n\"Fall of 1944, right after the Normandy landings, scattered among the Allies' troops are these little units of scientific intelligence officers and they're working to find out Hitler's biological weapons, his chemical weapons and his atomic weapons,\" said Jacobsen, author of \"Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring Nazi Scientists to America.\"\n\nThese intelligence officers eventually discovered while the atomic weapons program was not as advanced as initially feared, Hitler's biochemical weapons were. The hunt \"for this scientific treasure and ultimately for the scientists themselves\" thus ignited Operation Overcast, renamed Paperclip for the paperclips attached to the files of the most \"troublesome cases,\" Jacobsen writes in her book.\n\nThe U.S. was not alone in this endeavor. Britain, France and especially the Soviet Union sought to enlist these German scientific experts, as well. A U.S.-Soviet technological rivalry marked by the Space Race and Cold War would also serve as a motivation, and justification, for Operation Paperclip's existence.\n\nThe Nazis and their contributions\n\nBy the fall of 1945, German scientists starting arriving on U.S. soil. Not all the men recruited were Nazis or SS officers but the most prominent and valued among them were, having worked either directly with Hitler or leading members of the Nazi Party, such as Heinrich Himmler and Herman Göring.\n\nWernher von Braun, a rocket engineer, was instrumental in developing the first U.S. ballistic missile, the Redstone, and later the Saturn V rocket while serving as director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. As a Nazi ideologue and member of the SS, he traveled to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he \"handpicked slaves to work for him as laborers,\" said Jacobsen in a 2014 interview with NPR.\n\nHubertus Strughold, a physiologist and medical researcher, headed the German Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine, known for its torturous medical experiments on inmates from the Dachau concentration camp. Strughold claimed ignorance of any such activity until after the war, yet he appeared among a list of 95 doctors at an October 1942 conference discussing their findings. In the U.S., he was chief scientist of the aerospace medical division at Brooks Air Force and has since been credited as the father of space medicine.\n\nWalter Schreiber, a former Nazi general, also oversaw inhumane medical experiments involving bioweapons that resulted in countless of deaths. Following the war, he was captured by the Soviets but defected to the U.S. He worked for various government entities before finally settling in Texas at the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine, Jacobsen writes.\n\nWhile Schreiber would later serve as a witness during the Nuremberg trials, he, von Braun, Strughold and the rest of their fellow Nazis brought to the U.S. would never be held accountable for their own atrocities. Operation Paperclip remained secret throughout much of the Cold War.\n\nOur rating: True\n\nWe rate this claim TRUE because it is supported by our research. Operation Paperclip was a secret initiative launched by the U.S. government to recruit German engineers, doctors, physicists, chemists and other scientific experts for U.S. technological advancement, especially in anticipation of the Cold War. Many recruited German scientists did work for NASA and various other government entities. They were not held responsible for their war crimes.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The damage ...", "text": "Irpin, Ukraine CNN —\n\nThe pine forests around Irpin are Oleh Bondarenko’s happy place. He discovered them as a child, when his mom sent him to the area for summer camp, and he has been coming back ever since.\n\n“It’s a place full of memories. Vorzel, Irpin, Bucha, the forests, the fresh air. For me, this is a place of respite,” the 64-year-old environmental scientist told CNN during a recent trip to Irpin.\n\nThe hour-long journey from Kyiv – a trip he has made many times over the decades – was filled with anguish for Bondarenko, who worried what he would find in Irpin. “This is the first time I am coming back since our brothers ‘visited’ Irpin,” he said, referring to Russian troops.\n\nThis area was under Russian control for several weeks in March; it has subsequently become known around the world as the site of some of the worst atrocities committed by Russia in this war. At least 1,200 bodies of civilians have been discovered in the region since Russian troops withdrew from there, according to the Kyiv region police. At least 290 of them were found in Irpin, according to the city’s mayor.\n\nIn addition to the human toll, the destruction Russian forces caused to the landscape here is brutal and omnipresent: Scorched earth, forest floors ravaged by missiles, and trees broken down and uprooted, while abandoned military equipment litters the ground. Many of the town’s neat houses lie in ruins; the woodland and green spaces around them are off limits.\n\nAnzhelika Kolomiec, Bondarenko’s friend who lives in Irpin, told CNN the authorities have banned people from going into the woods. “We have a beautiful forest here, but this year there won’t be any walks, there won’t be any mushroom picking, there won’t be berries. We are not allowed to go in because of mines and unexploded missiles,” she said.\n\nWhile the world’s eyes are focused on the human suffering brought about by Russia’s invasion, environmental experts in Ukraine are keeping a close record of the environmental damage it has caused, to try to repair it as soon as possible, and in hopes of extracting reparations.\n\nThe mined and destroyed forest in Irpin is just one example of the environmental damage caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nSatellite images show large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine are currently engulfed in wildfires sparked by explosions and made worse by the fact that emergency services, forest management workers and the army are unable to get to them. The smoke from the fires is polluting the air.\n\nUkraine’s fertile soil is becoming contaminated with heavy metals and other potentially poisonous substances leaking from missiles, military equipment and spent ammunition.\n\nSpilled fuel is polluting ground waters and ecosystems are being hammered by tanks and other heavy technology. All of this is damage that will be felt for decades after the war ends.\n\nMost people may not see nature as a priority, at least not right now, when Ukraine’s future is at stake and people are dying every day amid the conflict.\n\n“When you see the crimes against humanity, the unbelievable atrocities, people being killed, tortured, raped, hundreds of them … it is natural not to think about environmental impacts,” said Natalia Gozak, executive director of the Center for Environmental Initiatives in Kyiv.\n\n“So it’s our task to pay attention and ensure that these types of crimes are also considered as a crime and that the Russians pay for everything – not only for killing people, but also for killing our future and impacting our future wellbeing.”\n\nTo keep Russian armored columns at bay, Ukrainian forces burst a dam near Demydiv, a village north of Kyiv. Alexey Furman/Getty Images\n\nGathering evidence\n\nBondarenko took part in the battle for Kyiv in March. He and his son joined the Territorial Defense Force – the mostly volunteer section of Ukraine’s armed forces – in the first days of the war.\n\nHe has now been released from duty because of his age and is slowly returning to his environmental work. He wants Ukraine to be ready to start rebuilding in a smart, sustainable way when the war ends.\n\n“We are faced with a much larger crisis now and have to put everything else aside, although I think very soon we will return to the environmental agenda and we have to start thinking about that now,” he said.\n\nExperts like Bondarenko and Gozak are also trying to raise awareness of the risks stemming from the environmental damage.\n\nBondarenko is a nuclear physicist by training and has spent a large part of his career working on environmental safety in the Chernobyl zone. The risk of nuclear pollution is high on everyone’s mind after Russian troops entered Chernobyl and targeted Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, the leader of the Humanitarian Disarmament Project at PAX, a Dutch peace organization, said international organizations are starting to pay more attention to the environmental damage caused by armed conflicts.\n\n“What we saw in Iraq and Syria is that environmental pollution caused by the war can pose acute risks to the health of people,” he said.\n\n“But no one was paying attention to it. Everyone thought the environment is something you know, for ‘tree huggers’ and people who like bees and butterflies, but then the reality on the ground was that people, and particularly children, can be exposed to toxic remnants of war, all kinds of chemical materials from bombs and factories, or other kinds of hazardous chemicals.”\n\nBecause of these past experiences, environmental scientists and humanitarian organizations have started building and using databases of sites that are known to contain hazardous materials.\n\nNow, when they receive information about an attack, they can crosscheck the database to estimate an impact on the surrounding ecosystems.\n\nA cyclist passes a damaged section of a forest in Irpin. David von Blohn/CNN\n\nThe Center for Environmental Initiatives has built an interactive map of incidents across Ukraine, breaking them down by the type of damage, including nuclear and chemical pollution, dangerous livestock waste and degradation of land and marine ecosystems.\n\n“During these massive attacks, tons of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals, including uranium, get into the soil,” said Olena Kravchenko, executive director of Environment People Law, an environmental think tank in Lviv.\n\nShe said the huge amounts of missiles, explosives and other types of weapons and discarded military technology used in war are not the only cause of pollution. Mass burials conducted without consideration for environmental safety can also cause long-term ground water and soil contamination. Ukraine has accused Russia of burying bodies in hastily dug mass graves to cover up war crimes.\n\nThe shared monitoring system can also help set priorities in situations where resources are extremely limited.\n\n“Most environmental damage can be addressed after the conflict, but there’s that 5 to 10% where you need to send in experts because there are certain types of chemicals where you need experts to clean it up and not people who don’t know so much about it,” Zwijnenburg said.\n\nSometimes, the damage may not be immediately obvious.\n\nWhen the Ukrainian army shot down a Russian missile flying over the Kremenets district in western Ukraine last month, some of the debris fell on an agricultural facility, according to the Ternopil Regional State Administration.\n\nThe impact site was cleaned up within a few hours, but the poisonous substances that leaked during the incident lingered in the soil and water for days, according to State Ecological Inspectorate of Polissya District.\n\nPeople in the surrounding villages were told not to drink water from their wells and a few days after the incident, dead fish were reportedly discovered in a river several miles away.\n\nWhen the State Ecological Inspectorate of Polissya District measured the ammonium levels in the river it found that they were 163 times higher than what is considered safe.\n\nAnimal populations, too, are suffering as a result of the conflict. Experts say the unique habitats on the coast of the Azov Sea in southern Ukraine are being irreparably degraded as Russia continues to pound the area with missiles and bombs.\n\nPrecious perennial forests and salt marshes in the Kinburn Spit Reserve in the Mykolaiv region were on fire for more than a week, its unique habitats were left devastated, according to Zinoviy Petrovich, the head of Kinburn Spit Reserve.\n\nPetrovich told CNN that the fires were sparked by exploding rockets; he said continued shelling in the area makes it difficult to extinguish the fires. “Another reason is a lack of equipment and the shortage of fuel for firetrucks,” he said.\n\nThe Tuzly Lagoons National Nature Park near Odesa is usually a haven for dozens of bird species that go there to nest. This year, most weren’t able to do that, Ivan Rusiev, a biologist and the head of the scientific department of the park, told CNN.\n\nRusiev estimates Russian troops have dropped around 200 bombs on the park.\n\n“All living beings feel the impact of this aggressive war,” he said, adding that the few birds that have managed to have chicks are now unable to feed them properly. The area is famous for its white and dalmatian pelicans, Rusiev said, with a peacetime population of about 1,500. “Now there are only a handful of birds,” he said.\n\nRusiev said that the sudden increase in warship and submarine numbers in the Black Sea is causing further harm. “We found dead dolphins on the shore killed by the low frequency sonars,” he said.\n\nUkrainian attempt to extinguish a fire caused by shelling in Sydorove, in eastern Ukraine, on May 17, 2022. YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHoping for reparations\n\nEnvironmental scientists and activists are already gathering evidence of the damage inflicted on nature by the war, hoping to use it in the future.\n\n“When we triumphantly defeat [the Russians], we will be able to count the real damage and present it to the barbarians who treacherously attacked us,” Rusiev said.\n\nAn environmental NGO, Save Dnipro, has built a chatbot – software that simulates human-to-human conversation – to make it easier to access data on pollution and to report suspected environmental war crimes. They are compiling the list and factchecking against open sources, but the verification and proper investigation will be up to the authorities.\n\nBut getting war reparations for ecological damage is a tall order. Zwijnenburg said that under current international law, the bar is “really high.”\n\n“To reach the threshold where governments can be held accountable for environmental damage, it needs to be severe, long-term damage to the environment before you can actually say it’s a war crime. And the only time this bar or the threshold has been crossed was in 1991, when Iraq set fire to hundreds of oil wells in Kuwait,” he said.\n\nThe United Nations Compensation Commission ordered Iraq to pay Kuwait roughly $3 billion for the environmental damage it caused during the 1990 invasion as part of its $52.4 billion war reparations package.\n\nMany activists are also worried about further damage being caused unnecessarily in the name of the war effort.\n\nAn investigation conducted by the European Union in 2017 and 2018 into Ukraine’s forestry sector said its forest control system was “not functioning properly.” That report, published in 2020, found that evidence from the ground “points to a culture of widespread corruption and illegal logging.”\n\nUkrainian national watchdogs have largely suspended their environmental protection work because of the war. Kravchenko told CNN that could lead to national resources being exploited.\n\n“We know Ukrainian foresters are cutting down the forest and the explanation is that it’s for the needs of the army. But is it for the needs of the army or for the needs of the corruption that exists in the forest industry? The environment suffers hits from all sides,” she said.\n\nBack in Irpin, nature is slowly fighting back. Next to the wreck of a burnt-out Russian armored vehicle, green shoots are beginning to emerge on a damaged tree.

Democrat and Chronicle\n\nROMULUS, N.Y. — The world's largest herd of white whitetail deer now have their own sanctuary — and tourists also can find a nest of a mating pair of bald eagles, a dam built by a beaver colony, and a former munitions igloo on the site of the former Seneca Army Depot.\n\nUnlike albinos, the Seneca white deer at Deer Haven Park are a natural variation of brown-colored deer that lack pigmentation in their hair. In 1949, the first white deer were spotted at the depot, which was built in 1941 at the start of World War II to house and dispose of munitions.\n\nCol. Frank Kemble Jr., the base's commander, prohibited killing the white deer that lived with the more common brown deer, and the white-coated herd at one point grew to more than 200. But as the Army’s presence decreased from 1995 when the Pentagon announced the depot's closure to the year 2000 when the military pulled out, predator kills, poaching, habitat degradation and starvation increased.\n\nAn aerial census two years ago revealed only about 75 white deer, but that's changing.\n\nNeed a break?

We’re looking forward to a very nice fawn crop,’’ said Earl Martin, whose purchase of 7,000 acres of depot land became final earlier this month.\n\nHis $900,000 bid for the depot called for a $13 million expansion of his business, Seneca Iron Works; the creation of 200 jobs during the next decade; establishing 20 Amish homesteads; and putting land back on the tax rolls. It also called for leasing 2,800 acres to a nonprofit group called Seneca White Deer Inc., which was formed in 1998 to save the white deer while promoting the economic potential of the depot as a tourist attraction.\n\n“I’ll be candid,’’ said Martin, 39, of Seneca Falls. “I didn’t purchase the depot with the goal of doing a wildlife park. The original bid was that it would be a place to expand our business knowing we’d do something for the white deer.\n\n“But interesting enough, I’ve got a bit of an affinity for the deer now,\" he said. \"They kind of grow on you. Now I’m down at the depot every other night and on weekends and just having an awesome time.\"\n\nHe first saw the deer at age 9 when his family took a ride past Seneca Army Depot to show his grandfather, visiting from Pennsylvania, the mystical white animals that lived inside the 24 miles of fencing around the government installation. His grandfather predicted that someday he would own the depot.\n\nNow the land off New York 96A about 3 miles west of Romulus features a spacious $255,000 welcome center, built entirely with donations that came in from around the world. Seneca White Deer owns it, and that's the starting point of the sanctuary's tours that began on a regular schedule in November.\n\nMore than 2,300 people took a tour of Deer Haven Park in the first five months of operations, according to Seneca White Deer.\n\n\"This isn’t a petting zoo. These are wild animals,’’ Dennis Money, the organization's president, said as the first white deer was spotted on a recent tour for media and Finger Lakes winery and bed and breakfast owners.\n\nAfter learning about the wildlife and military history of the depot from various displays and possibly purchasing a mug or T-shirt, visitors board a 25-passenger tour bus that runs every two hours 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.\n\nThe tours are a combination of photo safari and a trip through a military museum frozen in time.\n\nAt one time, 100 million pounds of missiles, bombs, bullets and grenades were stored here. So were strategic ores, including pitch blend that contained the uranium used to make the first atomic bombs dropped on Japan.\n\nPulling up to the entrance gates of the depot’s highly classified “Q’’ area, visitors get a sense of the seriousness of storing nuclear weaponry when the rusted remains of triple, electrified fencing come into view.\n\n“The depot was built in about six months with 100 miles of roadways, 40 miles of railroads and 519 ‘igloos’ or ammunition bunkers,’’ Money said. “When you look at these bunkers, you get impressed by how the men and women of that era were building six or seven of these every day.\n\nMoney, 71, of Canandaigua is a retired environmental specialist with Rochester Gas and Electric Corp. He has been involved with some of western New York’s most notable wildlife restoration projects, including river otters and peregrine falcons.\n\nBut Seneca Army Depot's white deer didn’t need to be restored. They needed to be saved.\n\nIf the depot's fencing had been removed as part of its redevelopment, the rare hoofed animals would have become easy targets for hunters and predators.\n\nSome white deer do escape the perimeter fencing, but Martin's investment has made that more difficult. Before he purchased the land, he leased it and in June 2016 began an aggressive program of habitat restoration.\n\nWorking with ecologist Keith Tidball of Cornell Cooperative Extension, Martin’s crews planted 250 acres with soybeans, corn, turnips, radishes and high-protein grasses. They also planted more than 4,000 trees — fruit, conifers, oaks and dogwoods — providing food and cover for deer, wild turkey and songbirds.\n\nThey repaired miles of fencing and increased security to help cut back on vandalism and poaching. Coyotes, the depot’s main natural predator, also are being managed through trapping.\n\n“Our goal isn’t to sterilize the whole place,\" said Martin, who plans to double his habitat work now that he owns the land. \"In nature, we know the weaker must die and the strongest must survive. That’s how we get better genes in the wild.’’\n\nOn the tour, visitors can exit the bus to explore the beaver dam, an emergency bomb shelter and the site of a former Seneca Indian village that white settlers took over. A cemetery contains soldiers' remains from the Revolutionary and Civil wars.\n\n“As a conservation park, you’ve kind of taken the sword and beaten it into a plow share,’’ said Money, whose army of volunteers have cleared bunkers of overgrowth for viewing. “We think we have something unique that nobody else in the world has here.\"\n\nCyclists also can enjoy the paved roads inside the depot, and hikers soon will have more trails to explore. Future ideas call for horse wagon rides, cross-country skiing and perhaps overnight lodging in a storage igloo, something Money likes to call a “bed and bunker.’’\n\n“I loved it,’’ said Jim Doolittle of Frontenac Point Vineyard in Trumansburg, whose wife, Carol, is a Seneca White Deer volunteer. “Guests are always looking for things to do, and you won’t find anything like this anywhere else.\"\n\nWitnessing a white deer in the wild is a moving experience, said John Ingle, owner of Heron Hill Winery in Hammondsport.\n\n“Whoever sees the white deer doesn’t forget it,’’ Ingle said. “It’s almost a religious experience. They are so majestic and wonderful to witness.\"\n\nFollow Leo Roth on Twitter: @leoroth\n\nDeer Haven Park\n\n• What: Guided wildlife and military history bus tours at the former Seneca Army Depot near Romulus, N.Y.
