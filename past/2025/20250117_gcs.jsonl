Inside were clean needles, sterilising equipment, mirrors, “sharps bins” for the disposal of syringes, and supplies of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. There were also boxes containing protein bars, tea, blankets and a defibrillator, as well as two chairs and tables where injections could be prepared.\n\nThe van had been converted, and was being driven, by Peter Krykant – an ex-outreach worker with his own history of homelessness and injecting drug use. Frustrated with the fact that no overdose prevention centre (OPC) had yet opened in the city despite calls from the local NHS, he took the law into his own hands and, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, opened one independently.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The first such centre opened in the Swiss capital Bern in 1986, and there are now around 200 across the world from Berlin, Paris and Geneva to Sydney, Vancouver and New York.\n\nWhile the centres go under an array of different names including “drug consumption rooms”, “safer consumption sites” and “safe injecting facilities”, the essential concept – providing a safe environment for the use of risky, illegal drugs – remains the same. There have been no recorded overdose deaths within any of these centres since the first opened 36 years ago.\n\nNo such services exist in the UK, however. As drug-related deaths continue to rise, the debate over whether this should change has become increasingly heated – especially in Scotland, where drug mortality rates are among the highest in the world. The largest outbreak of HIV in the UK in over 30 years has been among people who inject drugs in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, and is ongoing.\n\nKrykant’s unsanctioned Glasgow OPC operated for nine months. It oversaw 894 injection events involving heroin and cocaine and treated nine potentially fatal overdoses. Krykant describes its impact as “overwhelming”:\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Glasgow police largely tolerated the facility, although on one occasion Krykant was cautioned for refusing to let officers into the van while it was being used. And the media were fascinated: during its brief time of operation, reports about the van appeared in UK and international media including the New York Times.\n\nDue to health issues, Krykant reluctantly closed the facility in the summer of 2021. The van was donated to the Transform Drug Policy Foundation and now tours the UK, demonstrating what an OPC would look like in practice. Krykant believes it served a vital purpose in demonstrating that “it could be possible to set up and run OPCs within current frameworks”. He is still hopeful that a formal facility will be commissioned in the near future – but the UK government remains opposed to their introduction.\n\nCampaigning amid controversy\n\nPat Hudson is an emeritus professor of history at Cardiff University. In 2017, her son Kevin was found dead in a locked toilet in a department store in the Welsh town of Carmarthen. He was 32 and an experienced tree surgeon.\n\nKevin Hudson died of cardiac arrest and brain damage after injecting heroin. He had been battling addiction and was making progress, but died alone after the kind of accidental overdose that kills thousands of people in the UK every year.\n\nHudson, a member of the campaign group Anyone’s Child: Families for Safer Drug Control, is calling for OPCs to be introduced as a way of providing this kind of life-saving support. While first and foremost about saving lives, she says this is also about “providing medical and addiction advice for those seeking help”.\n\nOPCs have been found to successfully reduce the risk of blood-borne virus transmission, signpost clients to treatment services, provide advice on safer consumption, and reduce levels of public injecting and discarded needles. By creating a non-stigmatising environment, they can also attract people who might otherwise not come into contact with support services – or who previously had unhappy experiences in treatment.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are thought to use opiates or crack cocaine regularly in England, of whom about half are in treatment. But even for those accessing such services, treatment can only help if they are kept safe and alive when they are using. For people such as Kevin Hudson, a lack of safe drug consumption spaces significantly increases the risk of death.\n\nIn December 2021, in response to record levels of drug-related deaths, the UK government committed more than £700m to improving treatment services in England and Wales – a desperately needed injection of money following years of disinvestment. But despite organisations such as the harm reduction charity Cranstoun signalling their intention to open OPCs when conditions allow, there are no plans for piloting such facilities in the UK government’s ten-year drug strategy for England.\n\nThe UN’s International Narcotics Control Board has stated that OPCs are consistent with international drug control treaties, as long as they are part of a wider system of drug treatment. But under UK law, allowing the preparation of illicitly purchased drugs for ingestion could be construed as illegal.\n\nAs things stand, this means anyone operating an OPC could potentially be liable for prosecution. In 2016, Scotland’s largest NHS organisation, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, recommended that an OPC be opened in Glasgow city centre in response to the high rates of drug-related deaths and the emergence of an HIV outbreak, highlighting “widespread support [among] stakeholders from the target population, health services, and organisations representing drug users and their families”.\n\nThe lord advocate, Scotland’s chief public prosecutor, was asked to produce a “letter of comfort” to guarantee such facilities would not be a subject for prosecution. This proposal was not successful and the current lord advocate has stated she cannot make an activity unlawful, nor grant immunity from prosecution. However, in 2021 she said she “would be prepared to consider any such future proposal, but it would have to be specific and underpinned by evidence, and it would require fresh consideration”.\n\nIn September 2021, the Scottish Drug Deaths Taskforce asked the Scottish government to “explore all options within the existing legal framework” that would enable OPCs to be piloted. Many Scottish MPs and MSPs have also called for action, with a private members’ bill currently being put through the Scottish parliament. And in January 2022, the UK Faculty of Public Health published a letter signed by every royal medical college calling on the UK government to “take steps towards funding [OPC] pilots … to save lives and reduce harm”. Scotland’s minister for drugs confirmed in June 2022 that a new proposal had been submitted for consideration by the Crown Office.\n\nThe UK government’s consistent refusal to introduce legal reforms to protect OPC providers from the threat of criminal sanctions has set Westminster against the Scottish government, which views OPCs as an important tool in its broader public health-led response to drug harms.\n\nRecognising that a policy change in Westminster looks unlikely in the short term, the Scottish minister for drugs, Angela Constance, said the Scottish government is “leaving no stone unturned to deliver clinically and legally safe consumption facilities”. In contrast, according to Hudson, the UK government is “digging its heels in” because OPCs are seen as condoning illegal drug use.\n\nWhat the evidence tells us about OPCs\n\nInsite was the first sanctioned and supervised injecting site to open in North America. Founded in 2003, it operates in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood of Vancouver, a city that for decades has experienced high levels of homelessness, street injecting and drug-related deaths.\n\nThe Insite facility provides an array of booths, each with a table, mirror and waste bin. According to 2019 data, there is space for more than 300 injections a day. People need not be registered and there is no form-filling on arrival. In almost two decades, there have been thousands of overdose events but no fatalities.\n\nInsite also offers a key source of evidence on the effectiveness and impact of OPCs. A 2011 study published in the Lancet found that, in the two years after Insite opened, the rate of overdose deaths within 500 metres of the facility fell by 35%, compared with 9% in the rest of Vancouver. More recently, a six-year cohort study found that people who used Insite and other OPCs in Vancouver at least weekly were almost 50% less likely to die of any cause than other people regularly using drugs.\n\nEvidence from Insite and other established OPCs shows that these centres reduce risky activities such as needle sharing while increasing engagement with health and treatment services. This led the UK government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to call for them to be considered for the UK in 2016.\n\nSimilarly, a 2019 review of global evidence commissioned by Public Health England found that OPCs were effective in reducing high-risk injecting behaviours, drug-related litter and ambulance callouts while increasing access to education and other forms of social support. This review also confirmed there was no evidence of increased crime in the vicinity of OPCs.\n\nOver the three decades since the first facility opened in Bern, the number of lives saved in OPCs across the world is likely to be enormous. And crucially, people who use drugs say they are likely to use OPCs if they are made available.\n\n‘Absolute and utter hope’\n\nOver a six-month period, our research team spoke to senior figures throughout Scotland – from the government and the criminal justice system to local health and social care teams and charities – to explore their views on OPCs and what they saw as barriers to adoption.\n\nWe also spoke to family members of people who use drugs, most of whom were overwhelmingly supportive. Many suggested that OPCs could provide a lifeline where other interventions had failed – and above all, “hope, just absolute and utter hope” that their loved ones could be kept safe when facing their most difficult and dangerous moments.\n\nMany were bewildered as to why OPCs had not been introduced already. One family member described a “lightbulb moment” when she found herself thinking: “I can’t believe we don’t do this as a humane society.” Another asked: “Why would we not want to keep everybody safe?”\n\nAs well as recognising the lifesaving potential of OPCs, local decision makers highlighted their value in reducing levels of public injecting and discarded needles – often the main concern for the general public who, as one respondent put it, just “want rid” of drug problems in their area. Among decision makers and family members alike, OPCs represented a compassionate, non-judgmental approach to drug issues. They mattered not only because they could save lives, but because they stood for an alternative response to drug problems more broadly. As one family member put it:\n\nKrykant, the pioneer of Glasgow’s mobile OPC van, sees this as a key point in understanding the full value of OPCs, concluding: “Although all data gathered is important, the human factor builds the most compelling case for implementation of these services.”\n\nSo why the resistance to introducing OPCs?\n\nIn June 2022, Alexis Goosdeel, director of the EU’s leading illicit drugs authority, described OPCs as “key instruments” in reducing drug harms. Goosdeel’s comments reflect a broad consensus within the drug research community – but this view is not shared by everybody.\n\nThe UK government argues that evidence of the effectiveness of OPCs is not sufficient to justify their introduction. In part, as one major review noted in 2018, this is because “estimating the overall effect of [OPCs] on fatal and nonfatal overdoses is difficult”.\n\nPreventing individual deaths does not automatically mean overall drug mortality rates will be reduced. Someone who has had an overdose reversed in an OPC may still suffer a fatal overdose later in another location. And OPCs often operate alongside other services such as the provision of take-home naloxone and drug treatment services such as methadone, which significantly reduce death rates.\n\nA recent review of an OPC in Melbourne, Australia, estimated that, of the 271 “extremely serious overdoses” that were treated in its first two years of operation, between 21 and 27 deaths were avoided. But again it is difficult to isolate the impact on drug deaths from other factors; some have argued that a “heroin drought” skewed the initial results from Sydney’s Medically Supervised Injecting Centre.\n\nTaken alongside the practical difficulties of gathering data on people who are often hard to engage with, OPCs are not practical or ethical for the randomised controlled trial (RCT) or large-scale cohort evaluations that may be expected for other medical interventions – although a recent French study applied some of these methods and shown positive results. However, as a recent Lancet commentary on OPCs pointed out, “many public health interventions have been introduced without RCTs when their mechanism of action is clearly understood”.\n\nOur study found that local decision makers are most concerned about whether OPCs are cost-effective compared with other interventions. Here, the question of how to interpret the available evidence – and decide what type of evidence is needed to justify investment – takes centre stage.\n\nWhile the UK government points to a lack of RCT evaluations, local decision makers are more pragmatic. Although there was a recognition that politically, the evidence would need to be extremely strong to get the green light, it was felt that such evidence could be produced through pilots or studies from other countries, people with experience of drug use, and public perceptions. Most of those we interviewed in Scotland felt the available evidence was sufficient to move forward to implementation.\n\nBut anyone hoping to develop local evidence faces a Catch-22. Building evidence requires opening an OPC – yet this is blocked by the UK government on the grounds that the available evidence is insufficient. Without the reassurance of central government support or formal agreements with local police, many local authorities and service providers lack the confidence to go ahead.\n\nWhat do families and communities want?\n\nAmong the family members we interviewed, OPCs were attractive not only because of the evidence that they save lives, but because they gave new hope and the promise of greater dignity for their loved ones:\n\nCommunities affected by visible public drug consumption, however, often have different priorities. As a number of our participants pointed out, OPCs also need the support of these wider community members if they are to be successful.\n\nIn the past, community support for OPCs has often been strongest when large-scale drug scenes – such as emerged in parts of Germany and Switzerland in the 1980s and in Sydney in the 1990s – became a pressing social problem. More recently, the dramatic rise in UK drug deaths has raised the political pressure for action. However, public concern over visible drug consumption, especially when many people find it threatening or morally wrong, does not necessarily translate into support for OPCs.\n\nA US survey found that many people believed money spent on OPCs would be better allocated to more conventional treatment and recovery programmes. Some community groups have expressed concern that OPCs would create a “honeypot effect”, not only attracting people using drugs but also dealers to the vicinity. However, other research suggests that if people hear stories about the experiences of people who use OPCs (or their families), rather than just being presented with statistics and data, then support increases.\n\nWhen a proposal to open an OPC in the Richmond district of Melbourne was announced in 2017, there was widespread opposition from residents who feared it would encourage higher levels of drug use, increase crime, and attract more dealers to their areas. A later evaluation found that, while a large number of deaths had been prevented and ambulance callouts had fallen by 25% near the facility, some local residents reported no perceived change to factors such as the number of discarded needles – and a degree of opposition to the OPC remained.\n\nBut this was in stark contrast to the experience in Sydney. In 2010, ten years after its OPC opened, the amount of street injecting reported by residents had halved, and there was a “considerable reduction” in reported levels of discarded needles in the vicinity – leading to high levels of local support. The Insite centre in Vancouver also continues to enjoy high levels of public support for similar reasons.\n\nIn a recent UK-wide poll, just under half the respondents supported OPCs and only 18% opposed their introduction. Yet for some sceptics, the basic principle of facilitating drug consumption is wrong, especially without a clear requirement that visitors take steps towards recovery.\n\nUnder former prime minister Boris Johnson, the UK’s Conservative government argued that OPCs ran counter to their “tough” approach to drugs – not only enabling but even “encouraging use” (a claim not supported by any available evidence). Because it is much easier not to open an OPC, political inertia and institutional risk-aversion are always liable to prevent innovation.\n\nSettling these controversies is about more than just appealing to evidence. Recent research confirmed what, to a casual observer, may seem obvious: even what you call these centres makes a difference. The label “drug consumption room”, for example, garners less public support than “overdose prevention centre” because one sounds like a facility designed to enable drug use to take place while the other frames it as saving lives. Getting public clarity on what OPCs actually do is therefore critical.\n\nThat OPCs save individual lives is beyond dispute. But they do so by accepting that creating safer environments for otherwise high-risk forms of drug consumption can be the right thing to do in certain circumstances. For some people, that will never be an acceptable principle – and the high level of stigmatisation towards people who inject drugs in political discussions only serves to reinforce this view. For many others, however, it sits at the heart of a compassionate and effective approach to reducing drug harms.\n\nWill OPCs happen in the UK?\n\nWhile every participant in our research supported piloting OPCs in principle, almost all decision makers felt the power to give the green light lay elsewhere. In Scotland, the issue is seen to have been kicked around like a political football, while the UK government insists that OPCs are a distraction from other treatment responses and claims advocates view them as a kind of silver bullet (something our participants strongly disputed).\n\nDespite many expert voices arguing that after more than 50 years, a review of the UK’s primary drug legislation, the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, is urgently needed, it seems unlikely that this act will be amended in the short term at least. Senior police authorities (such as regional police and crime commissioners in England), however, could agree to memorandums of understanding, guaranteeing that local police will not enforce the act in ways that prevent OPCs from operating. This would be possible without any change to primary legislation but relies on senior local leaders championing their case.\n\nThere is certainly growing support for OPCs in English regions such as the West Midlands that have pressing drug problems. Should regional police forces arrive at agreements to allow local adoption, there are organisations ready to create facilities and a considerable body of evaluation literature to support effective service designs. Importantly, there are also researchers in place to ensure that new services are rigorously evaluated.\n\nOPCs can only ever be one part of society’s response to drug dependency and harm. But without the opportunity to pilot them locally in the UK, it will never be possible to assess what the scale of that contribution could be, or how many lives would be saved. In the face of a growing drug death crisis, the need for action is more urgent than ever.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

But that ...", "text": "Jackson County, Oregon CNN —\n\nFirst came Chrissi DelaCruz’s tough breakup with her boyfriend of nine years.\n\nThen, her sister died.\n\nThe pain and loss led DelaCruz to traditional talk therapy. She also relied on alcohol.\n\nBut nothing really worked.\n\n“I was feeling pretty sad and lonely and disconnected and was feeling pretty lost and hopeless in what I needed to do next in my life,” the 37-year-old told CNN.\n\nHer next option would be a remedy the commercial real estate professional never imagined she’d end up advocating – and one that, while considered a therapeutic and healing drug by a growing number of health care professionals, has come under fire in Oregon ahead of next week’s election.\n\nPsilocybin, also known as “magic mushrooms,” is a psychedelic used for centuries in ceremonies by traditional cultures, and interest in it by the modern medical and scientific community has grown since the ’50s.\n\nChrissi DelaCruz, a commercial real estate professional from California, went on a psilocybin retreat. CNN\n\nDelaCruz signed up to try psilocybin to treat her mental health challenges in Jamaica – where using psychedelics is legal – on a retreat run by a company founded by an attorney in Oregon, where voters more than two years ago legalized its use on a protracted timeline, with licensing procedures set to launch in January.\n\nAs that date approaches, though, ballot measures Tuesday in roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities propose banning the psychedelic over concerns of a fraught rollout and problems it could stoke, from the substance’s effect on users to possible community consequences.\n\nOpposing the bans and trying to educate voters about psilocybin are Oregonians – including the operator of the Jamaica center, Silo Wellness – who want to set up facilities in the state where it could be used under the strict guidelines already in place.\n\nBefore her Jamaica retreat, DelaCruz also wasn’t sure about psilocybin, even as Silo Wellness pledged an experience with psychedelics that would help find “peace and purpose.”\n\n“I was totally nervous,” she admitted. “I didn’t know what to expect.”\n\nHow brain systems ‘move and groove together’\n\nScientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health. What is known is that just like common antidepressants called SSRIs, psilocybin attaches to receptors in the brain that trigger the release of serotonin, the “feel good” hormone.\n\nBut unlike antidepressants, which take at least a week to work and have to be taken daily, a psilocybin “trip” may improve mood in just one or two sessions. A single treatment with psilocybin reduced negative mood in people with treatment-resistant depression within three weeks, new research found.\n\n“One of the most interesting things we’ve learned about the classic psychedelics is that they have a dramatic effect on the way brain systems synchronize, or move and groove together,” Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told CNN earlier this year.\n\nA common theory is the drugs somehow break down the brain’s typical boundaries, so parts of the brain that don’t normally connect to each other suddenly do. At the same time, areas of the brain locked into a cycle of depressive thoughts quiet. This may create a type of expanded consciousness, experts say, that appears to allow the depressed person to break free of self-criticism and see new possibilities.\n\nPsilocybin can be taken in a pill form, smoked, ground and mixed with other foods, put into a smoothie or liquid, or even infused into chocolates and other sweets. A typical dose is a 25-milligram pill, which creates the full-blown psychedelic experience.\n\nDuring most psilocybin studies, trained counselors are present to establish a supportive setting, set expectations and stop the trip from turning “bad,” which might feel like losing oneself or going crazy. They also help the person undergoing the experience organize and retain their new outlook on life via talk therapy.\n\nDelaCruz and about a dozen others who met medical qualifications for the Silo Wellness retreat convened online regularly beginning two months before arriving in Jamaica in June to begin the five-day experience.\n\nIt included two psilocybin dosing sessions, dubbed “ceremonies.”\n\nDelaCruz had it “in a powder form that was mixed with, like, a juice,” she said.\n\nAfter 15 or 20 minutes, it took effect.\n\n“It’s almost like I could see the life in everything around me,” she recalled. “It sounds weird, but it’s like (I could) feel what it really is like to feel alive.”\n\nOne of the sessions was “very hard” and “very emotional,” she said. But despite the increased anxiety and discomfort, it also was very effective.\n\n“The biggest change was, I have more trust and confidence in myself through these ceremonies, therefore that allows me to reflect that back in my actions and in my thoughts and how I affect other people,” DelaCruz said.\n\n“That proved to me that everything that I need to heal is within myself.”\n\n‘There’s no magic here’\n\nThe process, according to Silo Wellness CEO Mike Arnold, isn’t fun.\n\n“(It) can be very, very uncomfortable most of the time, and you have to put in the work, too. So, after you’re done with it, even if you have a great session and you feel like you’re connected to nature and everything’s beautiful and easy … still, you gotta put in the work afterward.\n\n“Like, there’s no magic here.”\n\nArnold founded Silo Wellness in 2018 after having what he described as a life-changing experience with psilocybin, then started the retreats in Jamaica.\n\nHow psilocybin may rewire the brain\n\nIn addition to a strict intake process that screens for underlying medical issues that might be worsened by psilocybin – such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – medical professionals on-site throughout the retreat keep close watch over participants before, during and after the ceremonies, he said.\n\n“I think drugs are not the answer to anything,” Arnold said, but “certain molecules can be a tool to finding the answers if used appropriately and responsibly and safely.”\n\nPlanning for centers to take root in Oregon\n\nIn 2020, Oregon became the first US state to legalize psilocybin for personal use for those over age 21. More than 1.2 million residents, or 55.7% of voters, voted in favor of legalizing it, with most of those opposed living in the rural eastern and southern parts of the state.\n\nYet unlike cannabis, which in Oregon and other states can be used at home, psilocybin must be administered at licensed “service centers” under the direction of trained “facilitators,” who must meet criteria including age and residency and pass regulations exams and background checks but need not have a medical background. Not required to be on hand in Oregon are counselors or therapists who support talk therapy and could help avert a “bad” trip.\n\nThough the vote was two years ago, the application process to become a service center or facilitator is slated to start in January, and participants would have to complete a “preparation session” before receiving any psilocybin and have a designated driver after treatment. The rules also require any center to have a safety and security plan in place for each client and allow for, but do not require, a “client support person” to be present during the session.\n\nEven under the tight rules, Arnold wants to bring Silo Wellness’s Jamaica retreat model to Oregon and has identified New Frontier Ranch in rural southern Jackson County as an ideal setting. He’d grow the mushrooms on-site in a small, indoor, lab-like space – separate from living quarters – where a bathtub-sized container could supply his retreats for an entire year.\n\nFarmer Jason Lampman wants to open a psilocybin \"service center.\" CNN\n\nFarther north, in McMinnville, Oregon, farmer Jason Lampman is eyeing the potential on a much smaller scale. He’s hoping to make his 1-acre orchard a psilocybin “service center” and treat people on-site, growing the mushrooms in a retrofitted shipping container and hosting clients for a few hours each in a yurt.\n\n“There are laws and rules that are written out,” Lampman said. “This is safe, (and) it is extremely expensive to get into this and there are very strict rules.”\n\nLampman estimates he’ll spend nearly $50,000 to get licensed and trained, in addition to building infrastructure to comply. He hopes he’ll be able to recoup the investment swiftly and add to profits from his other small crops, like hemp, hazelnuts and apples.\n\nAsked if he worries about giving doses of psilocybin on the same property where his wife and their three toddlers live, Lampman pointed directly across the street to his neighbor’s lush vineyard.\n\n“There’s a winery right there,” he said. “People can drink as much alcohol as they want and drive down this road. I think that’s a way more concerning conversation that I’m gonna have.”\n\nFor some, this brings back bad memories\n\nWhile Oregon legalized psilocybin use more than two years ago, roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities are now proposing ballot measures Tuesday to ban the psychedelic in their communities.\n\n“We just want to say no; we want to opt out for a while,” said Stayton Mayor Henry Porter. “The health, safety and welfare of the community, that’s my main responsibility.”\n\nAfter seven terms as mayor and more than three decades as a high school civics teacher, Porter’s worry is rooted in the lingering unknowns surrounding psilocybin, he said, adding he fears the January start date for state applications is too soon.\n\n“I don’t know what it does. I don’t know how it would be controlled. I don’t know how to keep kids away from it,” he said. “I guess it’s the fear of things we don’t understand.”\n\nA neighbor of New Frontier Ranch, where Arnold hopes to set up his retreat, echoes a similar concern.\n\n“I don’t really know a lot about it. … That’s part of the problem,” said Mary Anne Crandall, who supports a local ban on psilocybin following the rocky 2015 cannabis rollout. She and others in Jackson County recalled promises by lawmakers and cannabis advocates that legalization of that drug would eradicate cartel influence and stop illegal grows.\n\nInstead, Crandall said, “it’s made it worse,” adding they’ve seen an influx of human trafficking and a depletion of water resources.\n\nStill reeling, “we feel like we don’t have a voice in what’s going on” now with psilocybin, Crandall said.\n\nOregon officials did not respond to CNN’s specific questions about human trafficking and water use in the marijuana industry but recently started requiring those working on grow farms to report suspected human and sex trafficking.\n\nMeantime, Angela Allbee, who helps manage the Oregon Psilocybin Services Section of the state’s public health division, acknowledged “many lessons learned” from the state’s cannabis rollout and touted the robust rulemaking and feedback processes implemented this time around for psilocybin.\n\nA rush to educate voters\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday’s election, Mike Arnold and other psilocybin advocates are urgently educating voters on the industry as he envisions it.\n\n“These folks are scared and they’re concerned and rightfully so because they had experiences with another ballot measure that promised good things that didn’t necessarily deliver,” he said.\n\nArnold is confident the rollout for psilocybin will not be a repeat of cannabis in Oregon – in part, he argued, because of where the profit is made.\n\n“It comes down to the economic basis of the two industries: Cannabis is a product, a commodity,” he said. “And psilocybin is a service industry.”\n\nIt’s a service Chrissi DelaCruz views not only as mind-altering but also life-changing.\n\n“There were a lot of different reasons (I went on the Jamaica retreat), and it was not to just go and trip out and have a good time,” DelaCruz said. “I was battling internally.”\n\n“It was a big release for me, and there definitely was a lot of processing and healing that I was able to do during the ceremony and then especially afterward, too,” she said.\n\nSince the retreat, DelaCruz has reconciled with her longtime partner and no longer finds herself incessantly seeking external validation. She’s also reduced her reliance on alcohol.\n\n“And that’s just because I feel better without it now,” she said.", "authors": ["David Culver Jason Kravarik", "David Culver", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/middleeast/saudi-drug-capital-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia is becoming the drug capital of the Middle East | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.

Four members of his family were killed.\n\nPolice said he was under the influence of shabu, a methamphetamine, according to local papers.\n\nSaudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use, with one columnist describing shipments of narcotics to the kingdom as an “open war against us, more dangerous than any other war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country’s history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh.\n\nThe record seizure demonstrates what experts say is Saudi Arabia’s growing role as the drug capital of the Middle East, driving demand and becoming the primary destination for smugglers from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe kingdom, they say, is one of the largest and most lucrative regional destinations for drugs, and that status is only intensifying.\n\nWednesday’s operation was the biggest single smuggling attempt in terms of narcotics seized, according to the General Directorate of Narcotics Control. While authorities didn’t name the drug seized or where it came from, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has previously said that “reports of amphetamine seizures from countries in the Middle East continue to refer predominantly to tablets bearing the Captagon logo.”\n\nCaptagon was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing the synthetic stimulant fenethylline. Though it is no longer produced legally, counterfeit drugs carrying the captagon name are regularly seized in the Middle East, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n\nDrug busts of captagon in Saudi Arabia and around the region have grown over time. Earlier this week, A US Coast Guard boat seized 320 kilograms of amphetamine tablets and almost 3,000 kilograms of hashish worth millions of dollars from a fishing boat in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe drug was popularized in the kingdom some 15 years ago but has taken off more intensely in the past five years, “perhaps becoming on par with cannabis,” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, who has written on the topic.\n\nOne of the reasons captagon is spreading in use is “because there is a supply flood now coming mostly from Syria” where it is produced “on an industrial scale in the chemical factories inherited from the [Assad] regime” and supplied by warlords and affiliates of the regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Center for International Communication didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCaptagon can be sold for between $10 and $25 a pill, meaning the latest Saudi haul, if it was the same drug, has a street value of up to $1.1 billion, based on figures from the International Addiction Review journal.\n\n“Captagon’s amphetamine-type properties are sought out as a coping mechanism that can aid users facing food insecurity in staving hunger, and inducing a euphoric ‘rush’ that users have said to help with traumatic stress,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute in Washington, D.C. who has studied the captagon trade. “It’s also been said that these same traits for captagon have been sought out by foreign workers in wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, seen to aid work performance.”\n\nWhile hashish and khat are also common drugs in the kingdom, amphetamines are popular among Saudi youth. A 2021 study in the journal of Crime, Law and Social Change cited a user as saying, “captagon is small. My school mates and I like it more than hashish. Not like hashish, we can buy in tablet……Once we get 25 riyals from [our] parents, we can buy one tablet and enjoy it.”\n\n“In wealthier consumer markets, the drug has a different appeal, serving as a recreational activity amongst its growing youth population that, despite social reforms… have reportedly struggled with boredom amidst widespread youth unemployment and a lack of opportunities for leisurely activities,” said Rose. “Some consumers have justified captagon as less of a taboo substance, compared to ‘harder’ drugs like opiates and cocaine.”\n\nSince many young people in Saudi Arabia have been taking drugs as a result of boredom and lack of social opportunities, the increased freedoms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could help reduce some of that use, said Felbab-Brown.\n\n“The important thing is neither to curtail the freedoms, nor to turn concerts into places of dragnets and raids, but rather to educate young people,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of drug rehabilitation centers have popped up across the kingdom after the government began licensing private establishments.\n\nKhalid Al Mashari, the CEO of Qaweem, one of the first such centers to open, says around four or five have opened in the past two years. That’s a testament to the government’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation, he says, but it also shows that the problem is on the rise.\n\n“We’re in high demand, unfortunately,” he told CNN. “But at least people have an option now, instead of having to go to neighboring countries to seek treatment.”\n\nDespite the presence of rehabilitation centers, Rose says there is little public health messaging or campaigning to raise awareness about captagon.\n\n“While this taboo regarding drug consumption in the kingdom is not going anywhere, the government’s tendency to exclusively securitize this issue and downplay its role as a destination market will be harder to ignore,” she said.\n\nFelbab-Brown says drug policies in the Middle East have focused on the harshest of responses.\n\n“Unlike large parts of the world [that] have walked away from such rigid and mostly ineffective or outright counterproductive policies, the Middle East has often doubled down on them,” she said. “Imprisoning users is ineffective and counterproductive.”\n\nThe digest\n\nUS says Iran reply on EU proposal for revival of nuclear deal is “not constructive”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the US has received Iran’s reply to the US’ response an EU proposal for the revival of the nuclear deal on Thursday. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive,” said the spokesperson. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani earlier said Tehran’s response was sent after “carefully” examining it and “with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,” according to a statement.\n\nBackground: Earlier this week during a press conference in Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Iran needs guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the nuclear accord and reapply sanctions as happened under the Trump administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The US and Iran have been trading responses to a “final” EU text aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said he hopes the talks can be concluded in a matter of days. French President Macron also said on Thursday he hopes to conclude the talks in the next few days. It’s unclear how the talks will move forward from here as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment and break commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nFour killed during Shiite clashes in Iraq’s Basra\n\nClashes between rival Shiite groups killed four people in Iraq’s Basra on Thursday, as the fallout from the country’s worst political violence in years continues, Reuters reported. Basra is the main oil-producing city in Iraq and now violence has spread from Baghdad to the south.\n\nBackground: The violence began earlier this week in Baghdad when powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced his resignation from political life. That move set off an intense round of political infighting between Iran-backed Shiite groups and al-Sadr’s supporters. Both sides have been trying to exert control since parliamentary elections in October 2021 saw Iran-backed blocs lose seats to Sadrists. Despite his win, al-Sadr failed to form a government amid opposition from his rivals.\n\nWhy it matters: The episode served as a reminder of the fragility of the government in Baghdad, which remained largely neutral in the crisis, as well as the competing players at home and abroad that seek to control the country’s politics.\n\nTurkish pop star could face up to 3 years in prison for joking about religious schools\n\nSinger Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, known as Gulsen, could face a prison sentence of up to three years over comments made during a concert in April, according to a 48-page indictment. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office brought charges of “inciting the public to hatred and enmity,” the indictment said.\n\nBackground: Last week, Gulsen was jailed pending trial after a video circulating on social media showed her making a comment about religious schools in Turkey, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. During a concert in April, Gulsen said, “[He] graduated from Imam Hatip [religious schools.] That’s where his pervert side comes from,” referring to a person on stage. The singer denied the charge, saying it was a joke, and apologized to those offended by her remarks. She has since been released from custody but placed under house arrest. An Istanbul criminal court will assess the indictment and decide to accept or refuse it. If accepted, the hearings will start and Gulsen will be brought before court.\n\nWhy it matters: Gulsen has previously been targeted by Turkish conservative groups for her revealing stage outfits and support for the LGBTQ community. Her recent arrest sparked outrage and support from fans on social media. Some critics say it’s part of a move by Turkish officials to gain support from their religious and conservative base ahead of elections next year.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Abbas Al Lawati", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/us/excited-delirium-police-deaths-study/index.html", "title": "Authorities claimed these Black men had excited delirium just before ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn videos that show George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis police custody, an officer holding down the Black man’s ankles says, “I just worry about excited delirium or whatever.” Another officer responds: “That’s why we have the ambulance coming.”\n\nBut Floyd did not meet any of the 10 criteria used by many to diagnose “excited delirium,” a police surgeon testified later in the murder trial of the second officer, Derek Chauvin. And an independent autopsy found the 46-year-old died during the 2020 encounter of “asphyxiation from sustained pressure” when his neck and back were compressed.\n\nThat same year, Elijah McClain was diagnosed with “excited delirium” by paramedics in Aurora, Colorado. McClain was placed in a carotid hold by police and injected with ketamine when paramedics arrived. The medics never checked the 23-year-old Black man’s vital signs, talked to him or touched him before making the diagnosis, a Colorado grand jury found. McClain was declared brain dead three days later.\n\nAnd “excited delirium” was among the causes of death listed for Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York, along with complications of asphyxia in a setting of physical restraint and acute PCP intoxication, according to a medical examiner’s report. The 41-year-old Black man was having a mental health emergency in 2020 when officers covered his head with a mesh hood and held him prone on the ground before he stopped breathing. He was declared brain dead and died a week later.\n\nExcited delirium is used as a field diagnosis by first responders across the country. Officers in many police departments are officially taught to look for “superhuman strength” and “police non-compliance” as symptoms of a syndrome that could kill the subject of an emergency call or induce that person to kill them.\n\n“Pain tolerance,” “unusual strength,” “agitation” and being “inappropriately clothed” are other potential features of the syndrome listed in an American College of Emergency Physicians white paper cited in expert testimony in Chauvin’s trial, though the doctors’ group told CNN it never officially endorsed the 2009 document.\n\nSimilar descriptions of excited delirium can be found in police training materials used in several major US cities. Officers are called upon to make split-second decisions to identify the condition in order to preserve their own safety and the safety of their subject, including potentially by using force. Such a determination also later can be key to how the public, their supervisors or the courts view the incident.\n\nAuthorities claimed these Black men had excited delirium just before they died. But the diagnosis itself is a problem and should be abandoned, a new study says. But a new study from doctors at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as civil rights lawyers, says the term excited delirium is “scientifically meaningless” and has become a “catch-all for deaths occurring in the context of law enforcement restraint, often coinciding with substance use or mental illness, and disproportionately used to explain the deaths of young Black men in police encounters.”\n\nIndeed, a case that helped cement the term’s widespread use unfairly targeted Black people. And while there is no national database of excited delirium deaths in police custody, one study of 166 cases found that Black people made up 43% of those deaths from 2010 to 2020 nationally. Black or African Americans made up 13% of the population in the most recent US Census.\n\nIn rejecting the term outright, the coalition of physicians, civil rights attorneys and researchers who worked on the Physicians for Human Rights study wants it stricken from the official vocabulary used by emergency medicine technicians, doctors, law enforcement and medical examiners.\n\nIt should be replaced, they say, with an approach that prioritizes immediate treatment of the underlying causes of the behavior encountered by first responders. A better approach might also mean expanding the type of professional who responds to emergency calls to include those with specialized training in mental health and social work.\n\nMedical groups don’t recognize police term\n\nThe problem with “excited delirium” goes deeper than the phrase itself, said Dr. Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, a co-author of the study and a professor of public health and internal medicine at the University of Michigan.\n\n“We were concerned about the concept,” she explained, pointing to the myriad of symptoms often listed under the term’s umbrella.\n\n“People can become agitated or delirious due to multiple factors, ranging from alcohol withdrawal, drug overdose, psychosis. … What we’re arguing is that these underlying causes require medical attention, rather than forcible restraint by police.”\n\nOfficers learn in academy training to restrain and control a subject until medics – who are supposed to make any medical diagnosis – get to the scene.\n\n“Training typically involves recognizing signs of ED (excited delirium) and summoning emergency medical services immediately in such cases,” Sherri Martin, national director of wellness services for the Fraternal Order of Police told CNN.\n\nPolice also sometimes lean heavily on paramedics to use powerful tranquilizer drugs so subjects experiencing what they say is excited delirium stop resisting. Later on, coroners and medical examiners may use the same language, including as part of autopsies.\n\nAn umbrella term like excited delirium can also help facilitate the training process, Sergeant Tony Lockhart, crisis intervention trainer for King’s County, Washington, said. “You call it whatever you want; I see these behaviors.” Aggregating them into one idea, he said, is “helpful in some areas, to at least give us a different title to think about in our head.”\n\nEven so, the term is not listed in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases nor the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, tools seen as the standard for medical diagnosis across the world. The American Medical Association does not support it as a diagnosis, and the American Psychiatric Association, which does not recognize it as a mental disorder, referred to it in 2020 as “too non-specific” and its criteria unclear, adding that no rigorous studies had been done to validate it.\n\nThe term’s roots also raise questions. Excited delirium was first used in the 1980s, when a deputy chief medical examiner in Florida publicized a theory that Black women could die from “combining sex with cocaine use,” the Physicians for Human Rights study details.\n\n“For some reason, the male of the species becomes psychotic and the female of the species dies in relation to sex,” Dr. Charles Wetli of Miami-Dade County told the Miami Herald at the time, adding that it might be the genetic makeup of Black people that predisposes them to dying.\n\nThe modern incarnation of the term, the report says, was popularized by the 2005 mass-purchase and distribution of one book to police departments by the makers of TASER guns, Axon Network. The company distributed those copies to bring awareness to excited delirium, it told CNN in a statement.\n\nWhat delirium looks like\n\n“Superhuman strength,” one of the criteria to identify excited delirium listed in the 2009 ACEP report, is completely unfounded, Heisler said. Instead, “if you’re frightened, it’s going to be an intense adrenergic response,” she said. “You’re going to have a strong fight-or-flight response. (But) it’s not a response that in and of itself is going to cause death.”\n\nAdrenaline-related responses are responsible for an increase in heart rate, constriction of blood vessels and dilation of pupils, she said. But it’s unfounded “that you can just suddenly scare yourself to death – which in a way seems to be the implied physiological mechanism of excited delirium. But it certainly is the case that it’s very frightening,” Heisler said.\n\nIn their report, the Physicians for Human Rights authors used the American Psychiatric Association’s definition of delirium: “a neurocognitive disorder characterized by a ‘disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period of time and is not better explained by another preexisting, evolving, or established disorder.’”\n\nIn layman’s terms: “Delirium is a symptom of an underlying cause and not an independent diagnosis,” Heisler said.\n\nA person with delirium may show “fear, agitation, or euphoria, as well as reduced awareness of the environment,” and delirium itself is usually a sign of an underlying problem, such as organ failure, infection, lack of oxygen, low blood sugar levels, drug side effects, intoxication or withdrawal, according to the Physicians for Human Rights report.\n\nIn any case, “delirium … wouldn’t be defined just by the need for use of force,” said Dr. Debra Pinals, director of the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Psychiatry and Law.\n\nA photograph of Elijah McClain is part of the \"Say Their Names\" memorial, in part honoring Black people who died in police custody across the US, in 2020 in Boston. Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nThe report also raises concern over the use of the term in medical examiners’ and coroners’ reports as a cause of death. “Delirium is not itself considered a cause of sudden death,” it reads.\n\n“You can’t say that someone dies from any form of delirium,” Heisler said. “It’s like saying, what is the cause of death? Chest pain. What is the cause of death? I don’t know, shortness of breath. In a way, it’s as nonsensical.”\n\nThe National Association of Medical Examiners has never issued “any type of consensus on excited delirium and as an organization have not formally ‘recognized the condition as a diagnosis,’” it told CNN in a statement. Its president, Dr. Kathryn Pinneri, said, “I suspect it is accepted among many NAME members.”\n\nOfficers often feel caught in the middle\n\nIn the field and in medical settings, the treatment for delirium is to address the underlying cause with medical care such as hydration, medication, and pain control, Heisler said. Restraints are actively discouraged, according to the Physicians for Human Rights report, and “never include prone or neck restraints, and are monitored by an independent medical oversight organization.”\n\nBut Lockhart said in his trainings, he teaches officers to restrain subjects in “altered states” – for their own safety and for the safety of others involved – as swiftly as possible. “The longer it goes on, definitely more danger to the subject, definitely more danger to every officer involved and for that matter, any other folks around,” he said.\n\nLockhart’s view is that there should be as many officers around the subject as possible. “In an ideal world … one officer grabs one leg, and another grabs one leg, another grabs an arm and other grabs an arm, obviously giving commands and try to do that quickly as we can to get them detained to get that medical person access to that individual.”\n\nBut in reality, restraining a person in distress can be much more challenging, especially when only one or two officers are on the scene, he said.\n\nThe exhaustive training police officers go through as cadets on excited delirium – and continue to attend as mandatory refreshers throughout their careers – has shown, even in court, to be part of the problem.\n\n“The fact is, that term has been increasingly co-opted by nonmedical professionals and being used in nonclinical discussions or nonclinical realms,” said Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, member of the American College of Emergency Physicians board of directors and chief medical officer for the EMS system for Metropolitan Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\n\n“There’s quite a spectrum of educational programming, even within the house of medicine between different specialties. And then obviously, that just becomes even more exponentially magnified, if you will, if you look at the various and sundry training programs within EMS agencies, ambulance services, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and so there’s not one national standard educational curriculum in this.”\n\nIt’s clear more training and dialogue between the law enforcement and the medical communities is needed, Goodloe said.\n\nIn Lockhart’s 40-hour classes on excited delirium, he said he specifically tells officers, “You are not here to learn how to diagnose. You’re looking at these behaviors so that you may alter your techniques to get a good solution so everybody’s safe.”\n\nBut a disconnect between first responder training – based on the handful of studies that validate excited delirium – and most academic medical literature has first responders acting out of step with the medical community.\n\n“Police officers often feel like they’re caught in the middle,” said Martin, of the Fraternal Order of Police. “They’re not thinking about all of these other voices. They show up to work every day to answer the calls, to do their job, and they want to have the tools and the knowledge to do the best job that they can.”\n\nDepartments are also concerned with liability, she said, and they have an incentive to ensure officers are acting in accordance with regulations. “They don’t want their department, their officer, their community to suffer the death of someone who was or may be suffering with excited delirium.”\n\nPictures of Elijah McClain and George Floyd left by demonstrators line the fence outside a Minnesota police station in April 2021. Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Term can produce a visceral and negative response’\n\nBut changes in how police learn to respond to medical emergencies and mental health crises might not come easy. In Minneapolis, despite a 2021 directive from the city to halt excited delirium training, officers were still being trained on the concept months later, the Star Tribune reported in February. A digital slide from a training program shows the words “excited delirium” stricken through and below them, “severe agitation with delirium,” is suggested as a better term, a video obtained by the newspaper shows.\n\nDuring Chauvin’s trial in April, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testified the then-officer’s actions and use of force during Floyd’s arrest were contrary to department policy.\n\n“There is an initial reasonableness in trying to just get him under control in the first few seconds,” Arradondo said. “But once there was no longer any resistance and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back – that in no way shape or form is anything that is by policy. It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or our values.”\n\nAfter an outcry over the term excited delirium in 2020, even the American College of Emergency Physicians – whose definition remains the industry standard – has tried to shift its language in new studies to “‘hyperactive delirium.”\n\n“We recognize the term ‘excited delirium’ is increasingly being used in non-clinical medicine discussions and the term can produce a visceral and negative response, particularly among those in communities with complicated relationships with law enforcement or medicine,” a spokesperson for the group told CNN in statement. “In clinical discussions, patient care, and especially safety of patients during care, must remain the focus.”\n\nOfficers instead could be taught about an array of medical emergencies that may look like what’s long been known as excited delirium but that may warrant different medical responses, “including heart attacks, drug or substance overdoses or withdrawals, acute psychosis, and oxygen deprivation,” the Physicians for Human Rights report states.\n\n“I think we’re asking too much of police officers, and I think many of them are responding as best they can,” Heisler said. “They’re being told that you can put your knee on someone’s back and that’s safe. … Are we expecting police officers to be trained in all these medical diagnoses? I mean, are we expecting doctors?”\n\nGetting mental health experts to emergency calls\n\nThe Physicians for Human Rights report’s main recommendation is to nix the use of the term “excited delirium” altogether – erasing it from training manuals and autopsy reports – and encouraging medical associations that haven’t done so to issue statements discouraging its use among their members.\n\nOfficial responses to people experiencing mental and behavioral health challenges must improve, authors say in the report. That might start with rethinking who first responders should be, Heisler said.\n\n“We need to think about – are there other models? Could we bring in social workers, psychologists, trained behavioral health people, instead of having a group of armed, uniformed police that (are met) with a strong fight-or-flight response?” she said.\n\nLockhart, the crisis intervention trainer, agrees with this recommendation and sees major advantages in having team of “co-responders” that include police and mental health specialists.\n\n“Just inherently, by that officer being there and listening to the mental health person deal with a subject, that officer is getting better because they’re seeing things that work, new ideas, a different way of approaching something,” he said, adding that an officer’s presence helps ensure the safety of the mental health professional.\n\nIn the end, he said, the main benefit is that “the subject we’re dealing with is getting better help and hopefully sooner” than they would otherwise.\n\nOn an institutional level, the Physicians for Human Rights study recommends establishing “independent oversight systems and mandat(ing) independent investigations of deaths in law enforcement custody,” involving excited delirium in state and local governments, and it calls on Congress to do the same.\n\nA report commissioned by Congress could answer many questions the study has identified, said Joanna Naples-Mitchell, human rights lawyer and researcher at Physicians for Human Rights.\n\n“For example, where has excited delirium come up, and trying to understand why it is they are finding what seems to have been the case so far, that it’s majority Black men and other people of color this term is being attributed to?” Naples-Mitchell said.\n\n“And is it exclusively in the context of law enforcement where this term is coming up? Is it exclusively in the context of restraints being used that this comes up and deaths are attributed to excited delirium? There’s a lot that legislators can do to really leverage their powers as investigators to look at this and bring public attention to it more broadly.”", "authors": ["Julia Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/law/962056/pros-and-cons-of-trial-by-jury", "title": "Pros and cons of trial by jury | The Week", "text": "The jury system has long been widely regarded as a linchpin of democratic societies across the world, but their role and effectiveness is under renewed scrutiny amid a shake-up of the Scottish legal system.\n\nIn England and Wales, anyone accused of a serious crime “is generally entitled to a trial by jury, which means the evidence is considered by a group of – theoretically – impartial citizens who can then deliver a non-biased verdict”, wrote Glamour magazine’s Lucy Morgan.

The proposals have met with “derision from the legal profession”, but supporters argue that jurors are “too often swayed” by “rape myths” that put the blame on victims.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Pro: ensures representation\n\nHaving juries means that the “community is represented”, with members of any “race, religion, gender and socio-economic group” brought together to “decide the fate of a fellow citizen”, wrote Thomas Leonard Ross KC for The Sun.\n\nFelicity Gerry KC, a professor of legal practice at Australia’s Deakin University, agreed that in cases where the “public has a vested interest” and the verdict could result in a “life-changing punishment”, it is “vital” that members of the community, rather than a lone “privileged professional”, decides on the innocence or guilt of a fellow citizen.\n\nJury service is “an exercise in democracy”, Gerry added in article on The Conversation.\n\n2. Con: jurors can be biased\n\nJury members are “subject to all kinds of societal biases that may prejudice their interpretation of the evidence”, said Morgan in Glamour.\n\nFinding out what goes on “inside the jury room” and “the biases that might influence jurors” is of vital importance, said psychologists Dr Itiel Dror of University College London and the Open University’s Dr Lee John Curley and Dr James Munro.\n\nLike all humans, jurors are “fallible beings” who may have biases that can lead to confirmation bias – when jury members distort the evidence “against their preferred verdict”, or give “more weight to the evidence that favours their preference”.\n\nBias in the criminal justice system is a “significant issue”, the trio added, and can cause “miscarriages of justice”, but establishing “procedures” can help to “avoid the potential for bias to influence the process”.\n\n3. Pro: boosts public confidence\n\nDitching the “anonymous balance” offered by a jury, said Scottish Criminal Bar Assocation president Tony Lenehan KC, in favour of the verdict of a “single middle-aged, university-educated person, most likely white and male”, risks “attacks in the press for every decision the vocal minority dislikes”.\n\nThe lone judges “will feel those eyes upon them”, Lenehan wrote for The Times, and it would be a “strong character indeed who pays no heed”. Allowing this “one interested party” to potentially have any sway in a case “robs” the justice system of “public confidence” and “essential transparency”.\n\n4. Con: hung verdicts\n\nMost juries are able to “reach their verdict unanimously”, said Jacqui Horan, an associate professor of law at Australia’s Monash University, on The Conversation. But in some cases, they “unable to agree” after deliberating “for several hours or days”. This usually results in a retrial with a new jury.\n\nThe defence is “usually at an advantage” in retrials, according to The Sun, because the prosecution faces the “hard task of trying to surprise the defence team” with new evidence. By contrast, the defence can use their knowledge of the evidence presented at the first trial to “block all loopholes” and “amend what needs to be changed to build a stronger case”.\n\n5. Pro: checks on power\n\nScrapping juries would put “unprecedented power in the hands of judges”, said Spiked’s Luke Gittos, particularly in “complicated crimes” such as rape. Trials by jury are “inherently fairer” and are “an essential safeguard against injustice”.\n\nJuries can also be crucial in preventing “excessive state power”, said lawyer Samantha Love in an article for the Oxford Royale Academy. They can help to prevent “laws being enforced with which the population do not agree”, as well as ensuring that “society is involved in the administration of justice” and “protected from the state”.\n\n6. Con: expensive and time consuming\n\nAlthough many argue that monetary cost should not be a “relevant factor” in determining the value of juries, “practicalities can be as important as principles”, wrote Love for the Oxford Royale Academy. And the jury system does “have costs for the economy and the state”.\n\nNot only are jurors able to claim expenses for their travel and food during their jury service, they may also be absent from work “for sustained periods”, potentially costing them and their employer. To have to “sit in court for two weeks without ever being called to sit on a case” is not “uncommon”, Love added.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Irenie Forshaw", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961518/how-can-white-paint-protect-buildings-from-heatwaves", "title": "White paint: a cool solution for climate change? | The Week", "text": "Brilliantly whitewashed houses are a familiar sight in hot countries, from Morocco to Greece.

According to the team’s modelling, covering just 1% of the Earth’s surface with the paint could be enough to offset the total effects of global warming.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

However, most contain titanium dioxide, which absorbs about 10% of sunlight, so they cannot reduce temperatures below the surrounding level.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHomes painted with solar-reflective paint were one degree cooler than those with uncoated roofs, according to a 2020 study by the Indian Institute of Public Health.\n\nA similar Indian study in 2016 found that a white roof reduced indoor air temperature, on average, by 2.1C. The results “prove that white roof has a significant effect in reducing the indoor air temperatures in buildings”, it said.\n\nFormer UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, told BBC News in 2019 that painting a building’s roof white could reduce the internal temperature by as much as 7 degrees.\n\nThat figure was disputed by Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based Natural Resources Defence Council, which oversaw a pilot project in Ahmedabad City, western India, where more than 3,000 city rooftops were painted with white lime in 2017.\n\nHe said cool roofs could lower indoor temperatures by 2-5C, compared with traditional roofs.\n\nProject Drawdown, a UK climate solutions charity, estimated that white roofs and green (planted) roofs could avoid between 600m and 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, which is “roughly equivalent to two to three years of the UK’s total annual emissions”, said The Guardian.\n\nSo how is this new paint different?\n\nOver the past decade, researchers “have found greater success with multilayered coatings that incorporate tiny particles of varying sizes”, said Scientific American, “to reflect many wavelengths of light.”\n\nIn 2014, a group from Stanford experimented with layers of reflective surfaces in order to cool surfaces. But these processes were far more intensive and costly “than simply slapping on some paint”, the site said.\n\nInspired by the work, Purdue University researchers developed a new paint – using different compounds that don’t absorb UV light – with a hybrid approach that still incorporates the reflective aspect.\n\nIts formula reflects back 98.1% of sunlight and solar radiation, at the same time as deflecting infrared heat. Because it absorbs less heat than it emits, a surface painted with it cools below the ambient temperature.\n\nUsing this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet could result in a cooling power of 10 kilowatts, researchers found. “That’s more powerful than the air conditioners used by most houses,” said Purdue’s Xiulin Ruan, lead inventor and professor of mechanical engineering.\n\nThe ultra-white paint, recognised last year as the world’s whitest by Guinness World Records, “has plenty of competition from other researchers”, said Scientific American, but manufacturers would have to address keeping the paint white over time.\n\nOther concerns have been raised over the price of the paint, with high concentration of pigment necessary for the relatively thick layers, as well as the availability of the compounds needed.\n\nWhere is white paint in use?\n\nThe technique is already being used on modern city buildings, such as in New York City, which in 2019 whitened more than 10 million square feet of rooftops, according to BBC News.\n\nIn some of India’s most heat-intensive slums, a non-profit organisation called Mahila Housing Trust (MHT) has been helping residents paint their roofs white since 2009, installing 30,000 cool roofs in nine states, according to BBC Future.\n\nThe charity found that white solar-reflective paint was the most accessible cooling solution it had tried “because of its comparatively low price”, Bhavna Maheriya, MHT’s programme manager, told the news site.\n\nThe “simple solution” of ultra-white roof paint keeps the worst of the heat out of slum homes, said BBC Future.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/health/psilocybin-magic-mushroom-depression-wellness/index.html", "title": "Severe depression eased by single dose of synthetic 'magic ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA single dose of a synthetic version of the mind-altering component of magic mushrooms, psilocybin, improved depression in people with a treatment-resistant form of the disease, a new study found.\n\nThe randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which authors called “the largest of its kind,” compared results of a 25-milligram dose to a 10-milligram and 1-milligram dose of a synthetic psilocybin, COMP360, that was administered in the presence of trained therapists.\n\nResults of the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found “an immediate, fast, rapid-acting, sustained response to 25 milligrams (of COMP360),” said study coauthor Dr. Guy Goodwin, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\n“This drug can be extracted from magic mushrooms, but that is not the way our compound is generated. It’s synthesized in a purely chemical process to produce a crystalline form,” said Goodwin, who is the chief medical officer of COMPASS Pathways, the company that manufactures COMP360 and conducted the study.\n\nExperts in the field found the study findings promising.\n\n“They clearly found a dose effect and clinically meaningful improvement in just three weeks,” said Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n“If you were in the 25-milligram group, you were nearly three times as likely to respond than if you were in the 1-milligram group,” said Johnson, who coauthored safety guidelines for psychedelic research in 2008.\n\nThe rapid response to treatment was notable as well.\n\n“The maximum effect (was) seen the day after receiving the treatment. This contrasts with standard antidepressants, which take several weeks to reach maximum effect,” said Dr. Anthony Cleare, a professor of psychopharmacology and affective disorders at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, there are a number of issues that need further study before this drug would be available for clinical use, experts said.\n\n“The effects did start to wear off by three months, and we need to know how best to prevent the depression returning,” Cleare said, adding that not enough is yet known about potential side effects.\n\n“While the safety profile seems encouraging overall, great care is obviously needed when using psychoactive substances such as psilocybin. Larger studies are on the way that we hope will help answer these issues,” he said.\n\nBenefits faded\n\nThe clinical trial occurred at 22 sites in the United States, Canada, the UK and seven countries in Europe. The study was designed to test the safety of different dosages of the proprietary version of psilocybin.\n\nThe 233 study participants had treatment-resistant depression, which can only be diagnosed after a person fails to respond to two courses of antidepressants. Of the 9 million people in the US with medically treated depression, 3 million patients are resistant to treatment, studies have estimated. Globally, some 100 million people have treatment-resistant depression, Goodwin said.\n\nPeople with the condition are at a high risk of physical illness, disability, hospitalization and suicide, the study said.\n\nAny study participants on antidepressants were required to wean themselves from those medications prior to the start of the trial. Psychedelic treatment doesn’t work on people who are actively taking antidepressants — the receptors where psychedelics attach in the brain are already flooded with serotonin from their current mood-altering drugs.\n\n“Participants were requested to remain off antidepressant treatment during the first 3 weeks after the trial-drug administration; however, these medications could be started at any time during the trial if deemed clinically necessary by a physician investigator,” the study said.\n\nDepression severity for each person was assessed the day before treatment using a psychological scale widely used by clinicians. Counselors trained to offer psychological support were present during the psychedelic trips, which lasted between six and eight hours. Participants were also given two more therapy sessions in the first week, the study said.\n\nDepression levels were documented the day after the “trip” and another five times over a 12-week period. About 37% of people who took the 25-milligram dose showed improvement. In fact, 29% were considered to be in remission at week three, the study found.\n\nBy week 12, however, the positive impact on depressive symptoms had waned and no longer reached a level of statistical significance, the study found.\n\n“The incidence of sustained response at week 12 was 20% in the 25-mg group, 5% in the 10-mg group, and 10% in the 1-mg group,” wrote psychobiologist Dr. Bertha Madras, director of the laboratory of addiction neurobiology at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, in an accompanying editorial. She did not participate in the study.\n\n“This is not a spectacular response rate for a psychiatric treatment … and we would only expect this to worsen over a longer follow-up period,” said Dr. Ravi Das, an associate professor of educational psychology research methods and statistics at University College London via email. He who was not involved with the study.\n\nIn addition, “there were an uneven number of severely depressed patients in each group; with significantly fewer severely depressed people in the apparent ‘effective’ (25mg) dose group,” Das said in a statement. “This does not appear to be acknowledged in the paper.”\n\nSafety profile\n\nHeadache, nausea, fatigue and dizziness plagued 77% of the study participants and occurred at all dosage levels, which experts say is a typical response on the day of psilocybin administration.\n\nA small number of people in all three dosage groups experienced suicidal thoughts or injured themselves over the 12-week follow-up period, the study found. Within the first three weeks alone, two people in the 25-milligram group thought about suicide and two intentionally injured themselves. Two people in the 10-milligram group were suicidal, one self-injured and one was hospitalized for severe depression, the study reported.\n\nThose behaviors are “common in treatment-resistant depression studies — most cases occurred more than a week after the COMP360 psilocybin session,” the company said.\n\n“Remember that this is in people who were assessed not to be at significant risk of suicide when they entered the trial.

Roger Ekirch thought that sleep was a biological constant – that eight hours of rest a night never really varied over time and place.\n\nBut while researching nocturnal life in preindustrial Europe and America, he discovered the first evidence that many humans used to sleep in segments – a first sleep and second sleep with a break of a few hours in between to have sex, pray, eat, chat and take medicine.\n\n“Here was a pattern of sleep unknown to the modern world,” said Ekirch, a university distinguished professor in the department of history at Virginia Tech.\n\nEkirch’s subsequent book, “At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past,” unearthed more than 500 references to what’s since been termed biphasic sleep. Ekirch has now found more than 2,000 references in a dozen languages and going back in time as far as ancient Greece. His 2004 book will be republished in April.\n\nThe practice of sleeping through the whole night didn’t really take hold until just a few hundred years ago, his work suggested. It only evolved thanks to the spread of electric lighting and the Industrial Revolution, with its capitalist belief that sleep was a waste of time that could be better spent working.\n\nThe history of sleep not only reveals fascinating details about everyday life in the past, but the work of Ekirch, and other historians and anthropologists, is helping sleep scientists gain fresh perspective on what constitutes a good night’s sleep. It also offers new ways to cope with and think about sleep problems.\n\nThere is value in knowing about this prior pattern of sleep in the Western world, said Ekirch. He’sconvinced “a large number of people who today suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia, the primary sleep disorder in the United States – and I dare say in most industrialized countries – rather than experiencing a quote unquote, disorder, are in fact, experiencing a very powerful remnant, or echo of this earlier pattern of sleep,” said Ekirch, who stressed he was speaking from a historical perspective and not as a medical doctor.\n\nAdults need more than seven hours of sleep a night, but more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA panel from a medieval stained glass church window depicts a married couple sleeping. TonyBaggett/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMyth of 8-hour sleep?\n\nThe first reference to biphasic sleep Ekirch found was in a 1697 legal document from a traveling “Assizes” court buried in a London record office. The deposition of a 9-year-old girl called Jane Rowth mentioned that her mother awoke after her “first sleep” to go out. The mother was later found dead.\n\n“I had never heard the expression, and it was expressed in such a way that it seemed perfectly normal,” he said. “I then began to come across subsequent references in these legal depositions but also in other sources.”\n\nThese are notes made by historian A. Roger Ekirch when he came across the first reference to segmented sleep in a London archive office. University Distinguished Professor of History at Virginia Tech\n\nEkirch subsequently found multiple references to a “first” and “second” sleep in diaries, medical texts, works of literature and prayer books. A doctor’s manual from 16th century France advised couples that the best time to conceive was not at the end of a long day but “after the first sleep,” when “they have more enjoyment” and “do it better.”\n\nBy the early 19th century, however, the first sleep had begun to expand at the expense of the second sleep, Ekirch found, and the intervening period of wakefulness. By the end of the century, the second sleep was little more than turning over in one’s bed for an extra 10 minutes of snoozing.\n\nBen Reiss, author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World” and professor and chair of the English department at Emory University in Atlanta, blames the Industrial Revolution and the “sleep is for wimps” attitude it engendered.\n\n“The answer is really to follow the money. Changes in economic organization, when it became more efficient to routinize work and have large numbers of people showing up on factory floors, at the same time and doing as much work in as concentrated fashion as possible,” Reisssaid.\n\nOur sleep schedule got squeezed and consolidated as a result, Reiss said.\n\nThe image shows a lamplighter up a ladder.

She studies how families optimized their sleep in Britain, Ireland and England’s American colonies between 1500 and 1750.\n\n“Every discussion of sleep history seemed to center around the sort of watershed moment of industrialization, the coming of electricity ruining everybody’s sleep lives. The corollary of that is that anything preindustrial was imagined as this golden age of sleep.”\n\nA 15th century miniature of a room is shown. NSA Digital Archive/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHandley said her research suggested, just like today, sleep was linked to physical and mental health and was a topic that people worried about and obsessed over.\n\nDoctor’s manuals from the time are full of advice on how many hours to sleep and in what kind of posture, she said. The reference guides also list hundreds of sleep recipes to aid a good night’s sleep, she said. These include the bizarre – cutting a pigeon in half and sticking each half to each side of your head and the more familiar – bathing in camomile-infused water and using lavender. People also burned specific types of wood in their bed chambers that were thought to aid sleep.\n\n“For our period, sleep is very strongly linked to digestion, emotion, stomach, and therefore to people’s diets,” Handley said.\n\nDoctors advised sleepers to rest first on the right side of their body before turning to the left side during the second half of the night. Resting on the right, perhaps during the first sleep, was thought to allow food to reach the pit of the stomach, where it was digested. Turning to the left, cooler side, released vapors and spread the heat evenly through the body.\n\nIt’s thought this habit could be the origin of the phrase about getting out of bed on the wrong side.\n\nThis is a woodblock print of a fisherman dreaming, circa 1700, Japan. The artist is unknown. Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nNot all scholars believe that sleeping in two shifts, while perhaps common in some communities, was once a universal habit. Far from it, said Brigitte Steger, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who didn’t uncover any references to segmented sleep in her work on sleep habits in Japan.\n\n“There is no such thing as natural sleep. Sleep has always been cultural, social and ideological,” said Steger, who is working on a series of six books about the cultural history of sleep.\n\n“There is not such a clear-cut difference between premodern (or pre-industrial) and modern sleep habits,” she said via email. “And sleep habits throughout pre-industrial times and throughout the world have always changed. And, of course, there has always been social diversity, and sleep habits have been very different at court than for peasants, for instance.”\n\nSimilarly, Gerrit Verhoeven, an assistant professor in cultural heritage and history at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, said his study of criminal court records from 18th century Antwerp suggested that sleep habits weren’t so different to our own today. Seven hours of sleep was the norm and there was no mention of first or second sleep.\n\n“As a historian I’m concerned that arguments about alleged sleeping patterns in the past – prolonged, by-phasic and with napping during the day – are sometimes presented as a possible remedy for our modern sleeping disorders. Before drawing such conclusions, we have to do much more research about these early modern sleeping patterns,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23 - Source: CNN Try this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23\n\nRethinking insomnia\n\nRussell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said Ekirch’s findings on biphasic sleep, while not without controversy, had informed his work as a sleep scientist.\n\nExperiments in sleep labs had shown that when humans are given the opportunity to sleep longer, he said, their sleep can become biphasic or even polyphasic, replicating what Ekirch found in historical records. However, Foster, who is also the director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Instituteat Oxford, doubted that it was a sleep pattern that would happen for everybody.\n\nNobody should impose a regime of segmented sleep on themselves, particularly if it resulted in a reduction of total sleep time, he added.\n\nWhat was clear, Foster said, was that interrupted sleep was perceived as less of a problem in the past and that modern expectations about what constitutes a good night’s sleep – sleeping through the night for eight hours – weren’t always helpful.\n\nHe said a key point was waking at night need not mean the end of sleep. One example he cited was more people waking up at night during lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“They’ll get terribly anxious and worried about waking up in the middle of night, because that’s not what they normally experience,” said Foster,who is also the author of “Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health,” which will be published in May 2022. More likely, what had happened was that people’s sleep episode – how much time they have available for sleep – had expanded and wasn’t constricted by an alarm clock going off.\n\n“It’s a throwback to a time when we genuinely got more sleep,” he said.\n\nIf we wake up at night, sleep is likely to return, if sleep is not sacrificed to social media or other behavior that makes you more alert or activates a stress response, Foster’s research has suggested. Like most sleep experts, he recommended getting out of bed if you’re getting frustrated by the failure to fall back to sleep and engaging in a relaxing activity while keeping the lights low.\n\n“Individual sleep across humans is so variable. One size doesn’t fit all. You shouldn’t worry about the sort of sleep that you get,” he said.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/us/police-departments-struggle-recruit-retain-officers/index.html", "title": "Why police forces are struggling to recruit and keep officers | CNN", "text": "Durham, North Carolina CNN —\n\nIn a growing number of American cities, if you call the police, there are fewer officers taking the call.\n\nPolice departments across the nation are raising concerns about current and future staffing levels. CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\nDurham, North Carolina, Police Department Headquarters. CNN\n\n“It’s been tough,” Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. “We’ve had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn’t necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.”\n\n“The 911 calls don’t stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don’t stop and certainly the emergencies don’t care if you are 60% staffed or below,” Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. “This profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.”\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n“You’ve got a workforce that’s being compressed on the front end, you’ve got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),” according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\n“It’s a trying time to be a police officer in this country,” Wexler said. “So, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.”\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n“Well, right now it’s not a very desirable job,” John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. “Everything that’s been going on around the country for the last couple of years. … But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.”\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to “bridge the gap” between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, left, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. CNN\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n“The goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,” Dickens said. “That means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I’m trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.”\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. “There was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then … everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,” Dickens said.\n\nTyrone Dennis CNN\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n“They got to do better with pay … incentives to retain officers,” he said. “It would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That’s not cool,” Dennis said.\n\n“Basically we’re one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?” Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. “When you think of what the line of work calls for and what they’re having to do, they’re wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they’ve got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can’t even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn’t match up with what the apartments require. That’s a problem,” Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is “alarming.” The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department’s “specialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,” Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more “liberal cities,” Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing “unprecedented” losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\n“Our losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,” police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. “Many of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the ‘defund’ movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.”\n\nSeattle’s attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year. The department has had 356 officers leave over the last two years, according to data provided to CNN by the department.\n\nPeople that call police for non-life-threatening calls may have to wait longer for a response, unless staffing levels are improved, “you may be lucky if you get an officer 2, 3, 4 hours down the line,” McNesby said.\n\n“I mean it’s easier for me to sit here and talk about it,” McNesby said, “but it really affects the people standing at roll calls in the morning when they look to the left and look to the right and there’s nobody else there … or you have a citizen that’s on the line … where they feel the need for police attention and they dial 911 and you’re not getting anybody coming.”", "authors": ["Ryan Young Devon M.

The Senate has not yet voted on the bill, but President Biden has said he would sign it. FSU has already banned TikTok on university-owned devices, networks and WiFi due to cyber threats.\n\nBanning TikTok, however, would detract from the creativity and freedom in our country. The solution to “move to another app” is simply ridiculous due to the mass appeal of TikTok. No app has ever compared to its popularity and reach.\n\nMany are in favor of a TikTok ban due to potential security issues, as well as the increased screen time that results from using the app. TikTok’s short videos that require relatively no concentration to digest, paired with an algorithm that caters to users’ niche interests, make it difficult to put the phone down while going through TikTok rabbit holes.\n\nI certainly spend too much time on TikTok.\n\nI scroll mindlessly through videos at night before I fall asleep to the point that I hardly even comprehend what I watch. I am easily influenced by the creators I enjoy and have made a few mindless purchases simply because a shirt I saw in a video was cute.\n\nSelf-comparison is also a common side effect of TikTok usage due to various hidden filters and over-exposure to creators promoting unrealistic beauty standards. TikTok has inspired a plethora of random insecurities, from buccal fat to negative canthal tilts.\n\nI am not opposed to increased regulation of TikTok in the US, and I believe implementing an age restriction for TikTok is necessary. It would be ignorant to discuss the downsides of TikTok and not consider child safety. Some creators choose to exploit their children for views, which is not only wrong but also incredibly dangerous for minors.\n\nMost of these negatives, however, are to be expected from an app with the global reach of TikTok. I see TikTok as a wonderful app overall, so long as the individual user monitors their screen time and content is properly moderated.\n\nTikTok spreads ideas and trends to audiences worldwide. I have enhanced my music taste and style from the creators I see, as well as learned many new recipes.\n\nViral dances are another positive aspect of TikTok. These trends are a fun way for people to express their creative freedom and exercise at the same time, and can also increase the popularity of lesser-known artists.\n\nWhile it is vital to ensure the source you are viewing is accurate, TikTok can also be very beneficial for educational purposes. Freelance journalists use the app to spread information about current news, politics, health advisories and safety tips.\n\nTikTok tutorials are also incredibly helpful, and the condensed format is much easier to follow than a ten-minute YouTube video. Viewers can learn workout routines, makeup techniques and how to fix any number of things.\n\nApart from the entertaining and informative content, TikTok also employs many people and provides income for creators through its Creator Fund based on views and engagement. Furthermore, TikTok provides a platform for those facing hardship to share their stories, and many viewers choose to donate to their cause.\n\nTikTok certainly has its downsides. More regulation is necessary, and I support the idea of an age restriction for the app. But an outright ban on TikTok in the US would ultimately do more harm than good.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/12/army-lifts-ban-recruits-history-self-mutilation-other-mental-health-issues/853131001/", "title": "Army lifts ban on waivers for recruits with history of some mental ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – People with a history of “self-mutilation,” bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse can now seek waivers to join the Army under an unannounced policy enacted in August, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe decision to open Army recruiting to those with mental health conditions comes as the service faces the challenging goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018. To meet last year's goal of 69,000, the Army accepted more recruits who fared poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers granted for marijuana use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.\n\nExpanding the waivers for mental health is possible in part because the Army now has access to more medical information about each potential recruit, Lt. Col. Randy Taylor, an Army spokesman, said in a statement. The Army issued the ban on waivers in 2009 amid an epidemic of suicides among troops.\n\n“The decision was primarily due to the increased availability of medical records and other data which is now more readily available,” Taylor's statement to USA TODAY said. “These records allow Army officials to better document applicant medical histories.”\n\nBut accepting recruits with those mental health conditions in their past carries risks, according to Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatrist who retired from the Army as a colonel in 2010 and is an expert on waivers for military service. People with a history of mental health problems are more likely to have those issues resurface than those who do not, she said.\n\n“It is a red flag,” she said. “The question is, how much of a red flag is it?”\n\nWhile bipolar disorder can be kept under control with medication, self-mutilation — where people slashing their skin with sharp instruments — may signal deeper mental health issues, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, which is published by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nIf self-mutilation occurs in a military setting, Ritchie said, it could be disruptive for a unit. A soldier slashing his or her own skin could result in blood on the floor, the assumption of a suicide attempt and the potential need for medical evacuation from a war zone or other austere place.\n\nA legacy of problems\n\nAccepting recruits with poor qualifications can cause problems. In 2006, for example, an Iraqi girl was raped and her family killed by U.S. soldiers, one of whom required waivers for minor criminal activity and poor educational background to join the Army.\n\nMemos and documents obtained by USA TODAY outline the hurdles that a potential recruit must clear to join the Army.\n\nGuidance for screening potential recruits with histories that include self-mutilation make clear that the applicant must provide “appropriate documentation” to obtain the waiver, according a September memo to commanders. Those requirements include a detailed statement from the applicant, medical records, evidence from an employer if the injury was job-related, photos submitted by the recruiter and a psychiatric evaluation and “clearance.”\n\nSlides for military officials who screen recruits show examples of people whose arms, legs and torsos have been scarred by self-mutilation.\n\n\"For all waivers,\" one memo states, \"the burden of proof is on the applicant to provide a clear and meritorious case for why a waiver should be considered.\"\n\nTaylor said many “meritorious cases” had been found of highly qualified applicants who had been disqualified because of events that had occurred when they were young children.\n\n“With the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant’s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant's ability to complete training and finish an Army career,” Taylor said. “These waivers are not considered lightly.”\n\nUnder the right circumstances, a waiver for self-mutilation could be appropriate, Ritchie said.\n\n“I can see a rationale that that shouldn’t be an absolute but could be a waiver,” she said.\n\nUnknown number of waivers\n\nThe Army did not respond to a question of how many waivers, if any, have been issued since the policy was changed.\n\nData reported by USA TODAY in October show how the Army met its recruiting goals by accepting more marginally qualified recruits.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the active-duty Army recruited nearly 69,000 soldiers, and only 1.9% belonged to what is known as Category Four. That refers to troops who score in the lowest category on military aptitude tests. In 2016, 0.6% of Army recruits came from Category Four. The Pentagon mandates that the services accept no more than 4% of recruiting classes from Category Four. In addition, waivers for marijuana use, illegal while in uniform, jumped from 191 in 2016 to 506 in 2017. Eight states have legalized recreational use of marijuana.\n\nRecruiting generally is more challenging for the services when the economy is strong. The Army has responded by offering more bonuses to those who sign up for service. In fiscal year 2017, it paid out $424 million in bonuses, up from $284 million in 2016. In 2014, that figure was only $8.2 million. Some recruits can qualify for a bonus of $40,000.\n\nThe Army's decision to rescind the ban for a history of mental health problems is in part a reaction to its difficulties in recruiting, Ritchie said.\n\n\"You’re widening your pool of applicants,\" she said.\n\nMore:Army is accepting more low-quality recruits, giving waivers for marijuana to hit targets\n\nMore:Army to spend $300 million on bonuses and ads to get 6,000 more recruits\n\nMore:Army hits target for recruits", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Using melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

Can we fix it?", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe screentime battles are already in full swing with my niece.\n\nShe turned 2 years old in January. “I want iPad,” she wails across the house during lunchtime. She refuses to eat, even though I can tell she’s “hangry.” She’s even more inconsolable when I tell her she can watch 10 minutes of Cocomelon only after she takes at least three bites of her lunch.\n\nIf it were up to me, I would throw “her” iPad away. I’m not kidding. I can’t stand to watch her – one of the most intelligent and empathic toddlers I’ve ever been around – get completely sucked in and tuned out on screens.\n\nShe taps and swipes and stares, totally hypnotized by its magnetic pull. Screens are already her go-to method of comfort, her favorite reward – even better than candy! – and all too often, the on-demand babysitter for her parents, who are overwhelmed and just trying to make it through the day.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here, and I have no idea how to help. To be fair, I whip out a phone as fast as anyone else when we’re all out to dinner together, and the crayons and puzzles stop working. We all just need a few bites of our food and five minutes of adult conversation, right?\n\nWhat’s worse, I often feel powerless against the pull of my screens too. I have zero doubt that smartphones have rewired our brains in negative ways. Not because so many new studies suggest it, but because of how I feel and what I see happening in the world around me.\n\nThe always-on gadgets that were supposed to make my life easier, more fun, and more productive, now often disrupt my sleep, ruin any semblance of work-life balance, and wipe out my self-esteem. I get lost in rabbit holes nearly every time I pick up my smartphone, and I routinely feel incapacitated when it comes to doing anything about it.\n\nAs bad as I feel about my own smartphone and screens, I feel worse for our kids. I’ve witnessed them suffer the most – from our device addictions and their own.\n\nGive them a smartphone or an all-access pass to social media too soon and risk alarming rates of “depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide.” But if you’re the one strict parent in the neighborhood who denies access, are you stunting their growth in an ever-evolving digital world and potentially socially ostracizing them too?\n\n'The Anxious Generation:' Have smartphones ‘rewired’ childhood?\n\nEveryone I know is talking about the new book, \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\" In it, social psychologist, author, and New York University professor Jonathan Haidt stacks mountains of evidence indicating a correlation between the rise of smartphones and sharp declines in the well-being of our kids.\n\nHaidt argues that the transition from a play-based to a phone-based youth has “rewired childhood.” He also says that it has “disrupted social and neurological development (and caused) social anxiety, sleep deprivation, attention fragmentation, and addiction.”\n\nThe problems ramped up around the year 2012, Haidt says. He cites hundreds of scientific studies and other high-quality data to paint smartphones, tablets, and social media as unstoppable forces, pushing Gen Z (people born after 1996) out of reality and into a digital world where rules aren’t always clear, people hide behind anonymous social media accounts, and rumors spread faster than wildfire.\n\nSmartphones and social media aren’t the only culprits, though. Sure, they opened a can of worms by providing unrestricted access to carefully orchestrated algorithms trained to lure kids in and keep them coming back for more. But Haidt says it was those factors combined with the rise of “fearful and overprotective parenting (that started) in the 1980s,'' and continues to the present day, that created a perfect storm for a diminishing ability to raise healthy humans.\n\n“We rewired childhood and created an epidemic of mental illness,” Haidt said in several recent interviews. “After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. We have overprotected our children in the real world and underprotected them online.”\n\nCritics argue that Haidt and his colleagues have all “mistaken correlation for causation,” among other complaints. But it looks like some of the sharpest critics haven’t actually read the book. The author is next-level transparent and shares the data and sources openly online.\n\nIsn’t this just the latest 'parent panic?'\n\nI’ll admit, it’s not an easy read as a parent. The most frustrating part, for me at least, is that I’ve known in my gut this was happening for over a decade. Most parents probably feel the same way, and despite doing our very best, we often fall back on the old, “Well, the train’s already left the station,” or “Before this, there was too much TV, and before that too much risqué rock music, and this is just the latest thing to freak out about” excuses.\n\nBut it’s pretty apparent that we’ve collectively relied too much on technology to pacify our kids. If life was a horror movie, this is where we’d realize “the call was coming from inside the house” all along.\n\nTech companies, of course, are all too happy to oblige. Most draw up extensive \"Terms of Use\" that prohibit kids of certain ages from using their services, but there’s virtually no enforcement of those guidelines. Ask anyone under the age of 13 how they managed to work around social media age restrictions, and they’ll say, “I lied about my age.” Um, duh.\n\nKids also love games and communicating with their friends online, and knowing when those habits cross over into problematic territory is proving to be more complicated than many parents imagined.\n\nSocial media and video games are among the worst offenders. “They hooked children during vulnerable developmental stages, while their brains were rapidly rewiring in response to incoming stimulation,” Haidt writes. “By designing a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids’ eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale.”\n\nThe damage, he says, is clear: An epidemic of pain and suffering among young people around the world that’s produced a generation of “failure to launch” boys and fragile, depressed girls.\n\nCan we raise healthy humans alongside modern tech?\n\nThis is a question I’ve asked myself and hundreds of others in the past decade, both while covering consumer tech and raising a now 23-year-old daughter.\n\nHere’s what I know for sure: extremes don’t work. “Zero tech” households are a lot like no-sugar families. Kids sneak, hide, and lie about the inevitable screentime they manage to finagle from friends, other families, and even school. They are often worse than their peers at self-regulation.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, giving a child their own smartphone before double-digits creates a sort of zombie apocalypse too. I’m thinking of one friend with a now 10-year-old daughter who spends nine or more hours a day on TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube. She told me recently she would “die” without her phone.\n\nAnecdotally, “extremely controlled” screen time seems to have the best outcomes, but that’s really hard and time-consuming for most parents to manage.\n\nThe problem is overwhelming. The peer pressure from other kids and even other parents is extreme.\n\nMany teens and young adults I talk to wish there were clear requirements and boundaries similar to driving licenses and drinking ages. One recent study even noted that a majority of college students say they “wish TikTok and Instagram were never invented.” My daughter has told me the same thing.\n\n“The biggest opponent we are facing is not that parents (or even teens) disagree with us; it is that so many feel hopeless,” Haidt’s lead researcher, Zach Rausch, wrote in an email. “Our goal is to show that there really is a lot we can do, especially if we act together.”\n\nA smartphone replacement?:The Humane AI Pin is unlikely to soon replace the smartphone but it has some wow features\n\nThe book recommends four \"new norms\" to turn back the phone-based childhood:\n\n◾ No smartphones before high school.\n\n◾ No social media until 16.\n\n◾ Schools should ban phones during the entire school day; just put them into a phone locker or Yondr pouch.\n\n◾ Finally, we need to give our kids more independence, freedom, and responsibility to play or hang out with each other on their own in the real world, just as most of us did when we were their age.\n\nNot all screen time is bad\n\nRausch is quick to point out that “not all screen time is bad.” He and Haidt recommend families watch an age-appropriate movie together or play a game in real-time with a friend or family member for a healthier dose of tech.\n\nThe problems, they say, come with sites like YouTube, “and other products designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on the platforms (e.g., TikTok). And it’s the asynchronous activities, such as posting and scrolling on social media, that sucks kids in and keeps them from real-world interactions that are crucial for their social development.”\n\nHaidt recommends flip phones before high school. I’ve been preaching this for the past several years, too. (I use a $20 Straight Talk Wireless Nokia 2760 flip phone on nights and weekends to help with my smartphone addiction and have recently given a handful to my friends with middle-school-age kids.)\n\nHaven’t we heard all of this before?\n\nI’ve heard – and offered – most of these suggestions before and not seen any real change. What’s different now? Will we actually roll back the damage and create a healthier future for our children with tech? Can we get tech titans who won’t let their kids use the same devices and apps they created to put age limits and more real-life guardrails around their inventions? We have to try.\n\nHaidt set a deadline and says society can “end the phone-based childhood by the end of 2025.” That’s a lofty goal, but he says we’re at a tipping point and he’s sure this can – and will – work.\n\n“We find that we don't need to convince many people about the nature of the problem. Most people see it,” Haidt wrote on his Substack. “Our main opponents are despair and resignation. The four norms offer a way out of the trap.”\n\nHaidt also compiled several “take action” resources for parents, schools, and everyone else who cares about this problem.\n\nI plan to take my niece’s family a copy of \"Anxious Generation.\" I’m not sure what else I can do for them except try my best to lead by example. That means I’ll put my own phone down when I’m with her (even if I might miss an adorable photo or 10). I also plan to take her outside and show her how to make mud pies.

So should governments consider setting the price of essential goods?\n\nIt’s been done before, typically during times of crisis, but for most mainstream economists, the answer to this question is a resounding “no.” Limiting how much companies can charge will distort markets, they argue, causing shortages and exacerbating supply chain problems while only temporarily reducing inflation.\n\n“Price controls can of course control prices — but they’re a terrible idea,” David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, remarked in a survey published earlier this month by the University of Chicago.\n\nAsked whether price controls similar to those used in the United States during the 1970s could reduce inflation over the next year, less than a quarter of economists surveyed said they agree while nearly 60% said they disagree or strongly disagree.\n\n“Just stop. Seriously,” Austan Goolsbee, a professor at the University of Chicago, said in response to the question. Goolsbee previously served as chairman of the Council of Economics Advisers under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe attitude toward price controls appears to be similar in Washington, where policymakers have shown little enthusiasm for even targeted or temporary measures despite growing pressure on middle class families that feel the pain of price increases more than the rich.\n\nStill, with annual inflation running at a four-decade high of 7% and midterm elections approaching, price controls could feature in future debates about how to reduce prices, particularly if actions taken this year by the Federal Reserve fail to tame inflation.\n\nPeople shop for groceries at a supermarket in Glendale, California, on January 12. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe problem with price controls\n\nPrice controls can be targeted or imposed on a broad range of goods, setting either a floor or ceiling. The German capital of Berlin, for example, has sought to limit how much rent landlords can charge tenants. In the United Kingdom, regulators limit how much consumers can be charged for energy and some types of rail fares.\n\nEconomists who are skeptical of price controls often point to basic economic concepts.\n\nThey argue that capping prices encourages companies to produce less of a product, while making it more attractive to consumers. Supply goes down, and demand goes up, with shortages being the inevitable result.\n\nBut that doesn’t stop governments around the world from resorting to price controls when inflation gets out of hand. As elections approached late last year in Argentina and annual inflation topped 50%, the government froze the price of over 1,000 household goods.\n\nLast week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would cut the price of flour, sugar, sunflower oil, milk, pork leg and chicken breast ahead of a national election in April, according to Reuters. He also extended caps on energy, fuel and mortgages.\n\nIsabella Weber, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, argues that price controls have a role to play in the United States, too, as policymakers try to address inflation caused by the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.\n\n“Price controls would buy time to deal with bottlenecks that will continue as long as the pandemic prevails,” Weber wrote recently in The Guardian, adding that “the cost of waiting for inflation to go away is high.” One key to making the policy a success, she wrote, is to remove price caps gradually to prevent a rapid surge in prices.\n\nFree market or price controls?\n\nThere is plenty of precedent for price controls in the United States, but you have to look a few decades back.\n\nThey were last deployed at the federal level during the 1970s, when former President Richard Nixon established a Cost of Living Council in the summer of 1971 and blocked most wage and price increases for 90 days. The policy was popular with the American public, and inflation slowed temporarily after reaching 5.8% in 1970.\n\nBut Nixon’s subsequent efforts to cap prices were much less successful. The Republican repeatedly tried to freeze prices during the next few years, but inflation surged to 11% in 1974 — exacerbated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) declaring an embargo on oil shipments to the United States the previous year.\n\nNixon had worked early in his career as an attorney for the Office of Price Administration, which was established during World War II to impose price ceilings on rents and a wide range of products. The price controls were largely effective, but gave rise to a thriving black market. The agency was dissolved in 1947.\n\nLimited price controls are also present in the US economy today. Some cities cap rents or the amount landlords can hike them each year, while government agencies limit the price that some monopolistic utilities charge.\n\nModern politicians tend to put their faith in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation, but the central bank may struggle to address price hikes that are caused by supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also taken some steps to combat rising prices by targeting corporations and using the power of his office. He has pledged to enforce antitrust laws and crack down on price fixing by meat processors, an industry that is controlled by just a handful of large firms. Biden has also released oil from the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves in a bid to reduce energy prices. Meat and energy are both significant contributors to inflation.\n\nPrice controls, it seems, are still a bridge too far.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/2023/07/03/do-blue-light-glasses-work/70307265007/", "title": "Do blue light glasses work? What experts say about their effectiveness", "text": "Among the fads to emerge from the pandemic − sourdough bread making, TikTok dancing, sweatpants tie-dying − wearing blue light glasses to cope with increased screen exposure remains popular.\n\nAs our lives move increasingly online, the number of minutes a day we spend staring at laptops, phones and tablets has skyrocketed. In response, many have taken to donning a pair of lenses specifically designed to block out the blue light emitted from our screens.\n\nBut are they really effective? And how damaging is the blue light anyway? Here's what experts had to say.\n\nDo blue light glasses really work?\n\n“They mostly don’t work for the things that they’re advertised for,” says Dr. Craig See, an ophthalmologist with the Cleveland Clinic. Blue light glasses are largely marketed as a solution to eye strain and as a protectant for the retina.\n\nTheir effectiveness is not backed up by the science, however. While they are successful in blocking blue light, blue light is not necessarily something that needs to be filtered out for ocular health.\n\n“At this point in time there’s really not enough science or evidence to support or deny the benefits of disease-causing problems with blue light,” says Dr. Ronald Benner, president of the American Optometric Association. He calls studies on the subject \"contradictory and inconclusive.\"\n\nBlue light, which is low-wavelength and high energy, does behave differently on the eye, See says, and in large doses can cause harm to the retina. However, as Benner points out, screens are not a unique example of blue light exposure. Indirect sunlight by itself produces 25 times the blue light a typical screen does, and direct sunlight produces 250 times as much.\n\nThat said, blue light can suppress our natural melatonin production, making it hard to sleep if there is increased screen exposure at night. So while the glasses will not protect you from long-term retina damage, and may not safeguard against eye strain, they can be a useful tool for screen use in the evenings.\n\nHow do blue light glasses work?\n\nBlue light glasses work by reflecting the light waves coming in so they bounce off the surface. There's a coating or filter on the lens that reflects the wavelength, or \"blue\" spectrum of light, preventing it from coming through.\n\nWhat are the benefits or negatives of blue light glasses?\n\nOne potential benefit could be better sleep. High-energy blue light, when it hits the retina, stimulates cells in the brain, essentially turning them on, Benner explains.\n\n“In the evening times, having the blue light filter on and blocking that so that we’re not suppressing the melatonin production might be a beneficial aspect,” he says.\n\nThat's a concern that could also be addressed by limiting exposure. Both Benner and See advise shutting off screens before bed.\n\nAs for the negatives, Benner says there is \"probably very little direct harm,\" but reminds us that \"we're not sure about the benefits yet.\"\n\nUsing blue light glasses as 'computer glasses'\n\nIf your eyes are struggling with prolonged contact with screens, there may be another answer.\n\n“The thought is not so much that screens start to bother our eyes because of the blue light, what is much more likely is that the eyes get dry,” See says. When we focus on something, we stop blinking so much, and our eyes get dry, creating strain.\n\nHe recommends the 20-20-20 rule as a remedy: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for about 20 seconds to give your eyes a break.\n\n“Eye muscles are fatigued just like leg muscles are fatigued,” Benner says.\n\nSome blue light glasses do have a +1 prescription on their lens which helps with up-close focus, See says. \"That part may be helping.\"\n\nDo blue light glasses help with headaches?\n\nLike with other purported benefits to the frames, there is not enough evidence to strongly confirm this claim.\n\n“If you’re getting headaches while staring at screens, the first thing I would recommend is people seek out their local optometrist to get their eyes checked,” Benner advises. It may be that you're experiencing a focusing issue or an uncorrected astigmatism.\n\nBlue-blocking lenses may help with fatigue, he says, and anti-glare filters can do the same, but a persistent problem should be addressed with a doctor.\n\nIs it OK to wear blue light glasses every day?\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that blue light glasses are doing harm, so wearing them every day will not likely be a detriment to your health.\n\nThat said, if you experience headaches or other bothersome symptoms related to your sight, your first stop should be the optometrist's office.\n\nWhat is macular degeneration?\n\nMacular degeneration is a condition in which a small part of the back of the eye that focuses on facial recognition and reading is damaged and vision becomes greatly inhibited. That part of the eye has a very specific design, and if it is altered vision can become significantly impaired.\n\nSmoking is a big factor in macular degeneration, Benner says, but blue light is more of a question mark. While it could increase macular degeneration and cataract development, \"the studies have been inconclusive and basically contradictory at times,” he explains.\n\nJust curious for more?

For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

Microsoft also committed to letting software developers use whichever payment system they prefer rather than require that they use Microsoft’s proprietary channels.\n\nThe pledge covers not just the Activision Blizzard deal but virtually all of Microsoft’s gaming business going forward, including metaverse platforms, CEO Satya Nadella and President Brad Smith told reporters during a visit to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s pitch to antitrust regulators to bless the Activision Blizzard merger — the largest in the company’s history. The deal focuses antitrust scrutiny on a tech giant that has so far avoided much of the criticism and skepticism that has been leveled in recent years at other Silicon Valley behemoths including Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).\n\nIt also reflects an effort by Microsoft to get ahead of legislation that targets the largest app store operators.\n\n“We want to compete. We want to compete for users; we want to compete for publishers,” Nadella told reporters. “I want us to approach this in a principled way where we are building our platforms, our technology, such that we are on the right side of history.”\n\nThe announcement comes amid a global reckoning for app stores, as software developers have revolted against what they say are high store fees and draconian policies that harm consumers. Those tensions have culminated most visibly in a lawsuit by Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” against Apple — litigation that Microsoft has supported with a friend-of-the-court filing staking out positions against the iPhone maker.\n\nAs part of Wednesday’s pledge, Microsoft vowed that video games produced under its own banner — including titles it plans to acquire from Activision Blizzard such as “Call of Duty” — will not be given preferential treatment on its app stores relative to competing games. It also said it would not use data collected from app store activity to compete with developers. And it added that Microsoft would not stand in the way of app makers contacting their users directly with information about prices or product offerings.\n\nThose commitments reflect a sharp contrast from policies and practices of some other tech giants that have come under fire. A key complaint against Google, for example, is that it has ranked or prioritized its own apps and services higher in search results. Apple and Google have lobbied hard against Congressional legislation to force open US app stores, saying that the new proposed rules could harm user security. (On Wednesday, Microsoft said that apps on its platform would still need to undergo “reasonable” security reviews.)\n\nSeparately, Microsoft said it has committed to Sony that popular franchises it acquires from Activision Blizzard will remain available on PlayStation under Activision’s existing deal with Sony, and that it has offered to extend the deal on a “multiyear basis.” The existing deal with Sony runs until 2024, Smith said.\n\nThe commitments will take effect immediately on Microsoft’s Windows store, said Smith, while a smaller subset will apply initially to the Xbox store before expanding to include all of the 11 principles. All of the principles will also apply immediately upon the launch of a forthcoming app store Microsoft is developing, which execs dubbed a “universal store.”\n\n“This store will enable people to connect across all devices, globally,” said Sarah Bond, a top Xbox executive.\n\nTrying to get ahead of scrutiny\n\nThe historic merger comes as regulators worldwide are rethinking how to apply competition laws to the digital world. Just a few years ago, the Activision Blizzard deal would not have attracted much scrutiny, Smith said, who added that the acquisition will make Microsoft the third largest game publisher in the world after Tencent and Sony.\n\n“Regulators don’t typically get all that concerned about a company becoming number three,” Smith said. “But we’re not in the world of 2018 or 2019, it’s 2022. And we recognize there will be more scrutiny of any large acquisition that is being made by a large tech company. So I think that it really behooves us to step forward quickly and proactively and be very transparent about how we will manage this business, with a clear eye toward the competition law issues and responsibilities that we have.”\n\nIn addition to the deal’s impact on video game players and app stores, regulators could analyze the merger’s effect on competition in labor markets, Nadella acknowledged — an area where US regulators have shown increasing interest. That may prove particularly relevant in light of recent reports of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace at Activision Blizzard, a crisis that Nadella said Microsoft may look to address once Activision Blizzard follows through on its existing public commitments on the matter.\n\nNadella argued the merger is pro-competitive from a labor perspective because Microsoft “is a preferred employer” among people who work in games.\n\n“So if you even want to take a much broader view and say, ‘What does it do to people who are employed in the gaming industry?’” he said, “I think Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and our commitment to people who work in the gaming industry, is another element that will serve us well as we go through the review process everywhere in the world.”\n\nLast week, Microsoft filed formal paperwork with the Federal Trade Commission to kickstart the merger review process, and has delivered an initial briefing to FTC staff, Smith said.\n\nWednesday’s commitments will be implemented regardless of whether the Activision Blizzard deal closes or whether governments worldwide succeed in passing app store legislation, said Smith.\n\n“This will be the right thing for gamers and our employees, and it is a clear message to regulators we’re leaning in and adapting to the kinds of issues they want to address,” Smith said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/04/whats-up-with-the-stanley-cups/72108927007/", "title": "When did Stanley cups become popular? Drink tumblers make viral ...", "text": "With the rush of people shoving their way into Target stores across the nation this week, you'd assume at first glance the crowd was battling over a big-ticket electronic or the Black Friday deals of the century.\n\nInstead, the throngs of shoppers were after just one thing - drink tumblers.\n\nWhen Stanley dropped a limited edition color of their massively popular cups in partnership with Target on New Year's Eve, stores across the nation began selling out instantly. In fact, the thirst for the coveted reusable water bottle is so high, listings on eBay have the originally $45 tumbler selling for upward of $100 to $200.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of searches online and a rapidly expanding profit margin, the century-old Stanley company has seen a massive resurgence in popularity and found footholds amongst new demographics.\n\nWhat is it about reusable drinkware that has everyone going wild? Here's what we know.\n\nLimited edition cups:The new pink Starbucks x Stanley cup is selling out fast, here's how to get yours\n\nWhat are Stanley cups?\n\nStanely cups or \"Stanleys\" are a brand of reusable water bottles that come in a variety of colors, designs and sizes. While the brand carries traditional water bottles, the most popular version is \"The Quencher H2.0\" line, a drink tumbler that comes with a straw and handle in 14-ounce through 64-ounce versions.\n\nThe Stanley brand has been around for over 100 years but historically focused on working-class, outdoorsy types as customers. They have largely advertised their products as being for people who love camping and hiking or who work manual jobs such as construction workers.\n\nTraditionally marketed towards men with an iconic green color (that went on an iconic green tumbler,) the brand has opened up to female consumers in recent years, seeing an influx of nurses, social media influencers and now teenagers interested in purchasing its products.\n\nWhen did Stanleys become popular?\n\nStanley chaos:Stanley's exclusive Valentine's cup causes chaos at Arizona Target store\n\nOriginally, Stanley produced simple reusable water bottles that were a success among blue-collar workers and outdoorsmen. It was only in 2016 that it launched the tumblers now known as the Quench line, though they were not very popular upon release, according to CNBC.\n\nIn 2020, Crocs executive Terence Reilly left the shoe company and became the president of Stanley, where he soon leaned into social media and influencer marketing to boost sales of the new line, which became the best-selling bottle the same year, reported CNBC.\n\nNow, #Stanleycup has over 6 billion views on TikTok, the platform on which the cups have become most popular, though some of the videos are also about the National Hockey League's trophy. Just #Stanley boasts its own view count of over 2 billion.\n\nThousands of videos on TikTok feature excited teens and young people showing off their massive collections, crying when unboxing a gifted tumbler or throngs of people rushing stores for limited edition colors.\n\nStanely's company-wide revenue spiked after the tumblers became a social media fad, jumping from $74 million in 2019 to $750 million in 2023, according to CNBC.\n\nHow Stanley cups became a consumer craze\n\nStanley’s boost in sales has been largely catalyzed by Gen Z and online social media influences, Jenna Drenten, an associate professor of marketing at Loyola University Chicago, told USA TODAY.\n\nStanley saw the potential value in this type of brand recognition when it began gaining traction a few years ago and decided to move with the trend and shift its marketing strategy, said Drenten.\n\n\"It created tumblers in new limited edition colors, creating both scarcity and novelty. It partnered with influencers and leveraged existing online chatter,\" she said. \"It moved the product from something useful to something aspirational. But all of this was done without compromising the quality of the product.\"\n\nStanley likewise tapped into another power of social media: consumer marketing. It's not only influencers who suggest products online, but normal people who buy them and love them, said Drenten.\n\n\"You may have seen recently the instance in which a young woman’s car caught fire and the only thing remaining was a Stanley cup in tact with ice still inside,\" said Drenten. \"The brand was tagged over and over again in the video and finally responded by buying the woman a new car. Social media marketing like this can’t be planned. It has to be community-oriented: letting consumers take ownership in the brand story.\"\n\nStanley effectively reached a new demographic and created new offerings for them, creating a reciprocal relationship between it and a newer fan base of women and girls.\n\nFor every simple video of a teen girl showing off her Stanley collection, there are dozens of others at her school pining after the same cup, Drenten said. This can do more for a brand than simply paying for influencers and banner advertisements.\n\n\"That type of peer influence in face-to-face settings is still some of the ultimate marketing,\" Drenten said. \"Consumers are walking billboards for brands.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/16/trump-news-conference-takeaways/77031064007/", "title": "5 takeaways from Trump's first post-election news conference", "text": "WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump’s first press conference since winning re-election demonstrated once again his ability to dominate a news cycle – and on a variety of fronts.\n\nTrump had organized Monday's event at Mar-a-Lago to tout a $100 billion investment he negotiated with a major Japanese tech firm. But, by the time it ended more than an hour later, he had stoked a media frenzy with controversial comments on a range of topics – from the potential ban on the social media platform TikTok to the causes of autism and the origins of drones that have been sighted over New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nIn many ways, Trump's news conference brought back memories from his first term, when the former Republican president frequently entered the White House briefing room to jostle with reporters and with his responses control the daily headlines.\n\nBut Monday's atmosphere appeared more cordial. He stood at a lectern alongside SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son and Howard Lutnick, his pick for commerce secretary and also the co-lead of his transition team. Looking at ease, Trump said his 2024 transition, so far, is going a lot easier than his first one after his 2016 victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\n“The first time everybody was fighting me,” Trump said. “This time everyone wants to be my friend. I don't know. My personality changed or something.”\n\nTrump quickly segued from one topic to another, sometimes answering the questions asked of him and at other times choosing to go off on his own. His event went on for so long, in fact, that it cut into the scheduled start time for President Joe Biden’s prepared remarks about a new national monument in Newcastle, Maine, with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from Trump's post-election presser:\n\nA lifeline for TikTok?\n\nTrump created fresh questions on Monday about how his administration will handle a potential ban of TikTok after telling reporters that he had a “warm spot” for the social media platform.\n\nTikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, is staring down a mid-January deadline to sell the app. The video site, popular with young people, will disappear from app stores and the web in the U.S. if it doesn't.\n\nCongress imposed the deadline in bipartisan legislation earlier this year out of concern that the platform posed national security concerns.\n\nBut Trump said he believed the social media app helped him gain ground with pivotal young voters in the 2024 election and would “take a look,” at the ban, which would go into effect the day before his inauguration.\n\n“TikTok had an impact, and so we're taking a look at it,” Trump said of the app, which around 170 million Americans use. “I have a little bit of a warm spot in my heart. I'll be honest.”\n\nAutism, Big Pharma and other glimpses into Trump’s health agenda\n\nTrump spoke at length during the conference about how his administration would handle hot-button health issues, saying that he has “very brilliant people looking at it” and that he has been conferring over dinner with industry titans including the leaders of Pfizer and Eli Lilly.\n\nThe president-elect also vowed to lower drug prices by targeting middlemen in the pharmaceutical business who he says are profiteering off average Americans. And he expressed support for the polio vaccine, even as his pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and allies have continued their overall vaccine scrutiny and skepticism.\n\nTrump said he’s heard that the number of autism cases has dramatically increased from more than one in 100,000 about 30 years ago to “one in 100” now. “There's something wrong,\" he said, \"and we're going to find out about it.”\n\nKennedy, a former presidential candidate turned Trump backer, has come under fire for his anti-vaccine positions and spread of misleading or false information, including refuted claims linking vaccines and autism diagnoses.\n\nBut Trump said Monday that he thinks Kennedy is “going to be much less radical than you would think. I think he's got a very open mind, or I wouldn't have put him there.”\n\nDrones everywhere, including above Trump's Bedminster estate\n\nTrump accused the Biden administration of keeping the truth about recent drone sightings from the American public, and said he’s postponing a trip to his Bedminster estate and golf course in New Jersey because of them.\n\n“The government knows what is happening,” Trump said of the drone sightings over many states, though he declined to say if he had been briefed by government officials on them.\n\n“Look, our military knows where they took off from. … They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don’t want to comment,” Trump said without offering specifics.\n\nHe added: “They’re very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won’t spend the weekend in Bedminster. I decided to cancel my trip.”\n\nRebuilding the border wall with Mexico\n\nTrump also returned to one of his favorite campaign topics, the border wall with Mexico. He accused the Biden administration of selling off unused portions of sprawling structure and threatened legal action to stop it.\n\n“We’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on building the same wall we already have,” Trump said. “It’s almost a criminal act.”\n\n“We spent a lot of money on building it, and we have hundreds of miles that we put up,” Trump said. Now, he claimed, thanks to Biden administration actions he didn’t specify, “We're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more, not even talking about the time.”\n\nTrump was referencing a report by the conservative-leaning Daily Wire that features video footage of trucks leaving with wall pieces and remarks from an anonymous border patrol agent discussing the removal and sale of wall materials taken from three spots in Arizona.\n\n\"I'm asking today, Joe Biden, to please stop selling the wall,\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not respond directly to Trump's comments. But a Biden administration official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity with USA TODAY, disputed the characterization.\n\nThe official said the disposal of unused wall materials followed a mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024, which Biden signed into law last December requiring the Defense Department to create a plan to \"use, transfer or donate\" the materials.\n\nFiring federal employees who won’t return to work\n\nTrump also vowed to fire any federal employees who don't physically return to their offices once his new administration begins and pledged to challenge in court a Biden-era agreement allowing for remote work.\n\n\"If people don't come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,\" Trump pledged.\n\nTrump described as “ridiculous” what he said was a five-year waiver that the Biden administration gave to certain employees, calling it “a gift to a union, and we're obviously going to be in court to stop it.\"\n\nThe Social Security Administration and more than 40,000 workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees union reached a deal earlier this month that would allow most of those employees to continue working remotely two to five days per week.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/16"}]}

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — The University of Delaware is launching a new Biden Institute, a research and policy center focused on developing solutions to wide-ranging domestic policy issues, the university announced Tuesday.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden will serve as founding chair of the institute, which will delve into many of Biden's passions, including economic reform, environmental sustainability, civil rights, women's rights, criminal justice and more.\n\n\"Every day of my career in public service has been motivated by the desire to ensure that every American is treated with dignity and gets a fair shot,\" Biden said in a statement. \"I am proud to continue that work at my alma mater, a place that is stamped on my heart.\"\n\nThe institute will be part of UD's School of Public Policy and Administration, and will be located, for now, on campus at 44 Kent Way in Newark. With top-ranked programs in city management, non-profit management and public administration, the school offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. More than 300 public, private and non-profit institutions draw on its research expertise, according to the university.\n\nBidens launch foundation to promote human rights\n\nThe new effort will be supported by adding about 15 faculty members to the current 24 positions and boosting enrollment at the public policy school. The school plans to expand offerings in the areas of smart cities, environment and energy, social justice and disaster management.\n\nUD President Dennis Assanis said the institute will capitalize on Biden's vast experience as a public servant. In January, former President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the highest civilian honor in the United States.\n\nBiden's \"insight and experience will lend invaluable enhancement to programming, education and research initiatives as the University of Delaware helps shape the future leaders of our society,\" Assanis said in a statement.\n\nBiden remained connected to his alma mater throughout his 36-year senate career and his vice presidency. A frequent visitor, he has delivered four UD commencement addresses. He was inducted into the University's Alumni Wall of Fame in 1984, and in 2011, he donated his senatorial papers to the UD Library.\n\nBiden's sister, Valerie, and wife, Jill, are also UD graduates.\n\nIn a separate release Tuesday, the University of Pennsylvania announced that Biden had been named the Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor at Penn, where he will lead the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. The new center, to be located in Washington, D.C., later this year, will concentrate on diplomacy, foreign policy and national security. Biden will also have an office in Philadelphia.\n\nAs Presidential Practice Professor, Biden will hold joint appointments in the Annenberg School for Communication and the School of Arts and Sciences, and he will also be affiliated with Wharton, Penn's business school.\n\nBut Biden isn't slated to teach any classes at either Penn or UD, spokespeople for both universities said. They declined to comment on the cost of their respective initiatives or if Biden will draw a salary from one or both universities.\n\nBiden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said the universities will fully fund the efforts.\n\n\"I don't have any further detail to share on cost or salary at this time,\" she said.\n\nUD spokeswoman Andrea Boyle said no state funds would be used for the Biden Institute and that UD is \"exploring fundraising opportunities and activities\" to pay for it. She declined to elaborate.\n\nBiden and his family also have a long history at Penn. His late son, Beau, daughter Ashley, and granddaughter, Naomi, are all Penn graduates. In 2013, Joe Biden received an honorary degree from Penn and was the commencement speaker.\n\nBiden: Russia is one of world's greatest threats\n\nBiden said in a statement that he looks forward to collaborating with Penn on \"promoting and protecting the post-WWII international order that keeps the United States safe and strong.\n\n\"The Penn Biden Center and I will be engaging with Penn's wonderful students while partnering with its eminent faculty and global centers to convene world leaders, develop and advance smart policy, and impact the national debate about how American can continue to lead in the 21st Century,\" he said.\n\nIn another indication that Biden is not slowing down, last week he launched a separate Biden Foundation to further his legacy, from fighting cancer and violence against women to supporting soldiers and their families.

In 2018, shortly before Bill's death in 2019, he had a conversation with James about how wrongs were being righted regarding his father’s legacy.\n\nOne was in 1983 when his Olympic medals were restored after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped his titles when his amateur status was withdrawn. In 2022, the IOC restored Thorpe’s records.\n\nWhen Thorpe — who was Sac and Fox and born near Prague — was awarded his two medals by King Gustav of Sweden, the king said to him, “You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.”\n\nWhile that distinction has lasted over 100 years, he’ll eternally be recognized as a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient. President Joe Biden bestowed the honor posthumously Friday in a ceremony attended by Thorpe’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren at The White House.\n\nFor James, the President of the United States’ recognition of Thorpe’s life is another important milestone in history.\n\n“It should mean a lot to the state of Oklahoma and to the United States,” James told The Oklahoman. “To this day, people still know and recognize the name Jim Thorpe.

The museum employs just three workers and welcomes over 200 people a week since moving to Bricktown.\n\n“Welcome to the Jim Thorpe Museum,” James said as he frequently does, “Where are you from?”\n\nMore:Oklahoman Jim Thorpe receives Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously: 'Greatest athlete in the world'\n\nThe answer he received floored him and served as a reminder of Thorpe’s remaining global legacy. The visitors were from Belgium and embarking on a Route 66 trip and when mapping their trip, they circled the museum as a must-see destination. Why? The duo studied Thorpe in school and his two gold medal wins in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, where 33 Belgians competed, remains fabled.\n\nJames, whose goal through the museum is to carry on Thorpe’s mission of encouraging excellence through sport and health, was invited by the Thorpe family to attend the ceremony in Washington, D.C.\n\n“For me, it’s beyond humbling,” James said. “I was blown away (by the invitation), the fact that they think so highly about us and what we’re doing in Oklahoma City to honor the legacy of Jim Thorpe and to keep that alive and in front of people.”\n\nEach time Bill would visit the museum, which houses the world’s largest collection of Jim Thorpe’s personal memorabilia, James asked him to tell him a story about his father he didn’t know. One day, Bill showed him a photograph of his father running with children and shared that his passion was helping kids live an addictive free and active life.\n\nIn his honor, the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame operates one of the largest drug, alcohol, tobacco and vape free initiatives in the state.\n\nMany of Thorpe’s accomplishments came before the country he was born in recognized him as a citizen, and he endured racism throughout his life. Despite being unfairly treated and never seeing his athletic achievement awards reinstated during his lifetime, he continued breaking down barriers on and off the field.\n\n“Now, with our current president recognizing Jim Thorpe (it means a lot),” James said. “For either his contribution to the country or to the world, I think Jim Thorpe fits in both. Not only did he represent the United States at the 1912 Olympics, he wasn’t even a citizen.”\n\nIt’s safe to say wrongs are being righted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/02/delaware-joe-biden-presidential-citizens-medal-louis-redding-collins-seitz-ted-kaufman/77406005007/", "title": "Joe Biden awards 3 Delawareans with Presidential Citizens Medal", "text": "President Joe Biden named 20 recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, including three people from Delaware.\n\nThe medal is awarded to U.S. citizens who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens, according to a White House statement.

In the last poll before the election out of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, she led by five points.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nKelly Ayotte wins NH governor's race as Joyce Craig concedes\n\nFormer Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has won the New Hampshire governor’s race over former Manchester Mayor Democrat Joyce Craig.\n\n“Thank you, New Hampshire! Ready to hit the ground running to keep our wonderful state safe, prosperous and free. Let’s get to work!” Ayotte posted on X.\n\nCraig had conceded first.\n\n“While tonight isn't the result we wanted, I'm proud of our campaign and the issues that we focused on,” Craig said. “I love this state, and I love Manchester, and I want to thank all of you again, all of you for working to make sure that we make New Hampshire a stronger place.”\n\nIf Ayotte’s win is confirmed, New Hampshire will continue to have a Republican in the corner office, something they have had since Sununu first won in 2016.\n\nThe win will come after a hard-fought campaign that often became personal. Abortion was a top issue in the race, with both candidates releasing ads describing miscarriages. Craig heavily criticized Ayotte’s anti-abortion record in Congress, leading Ayotte to produce multiple ads saying that she would not change New Hampshire’s 24-week abortion law.\n\nThe city of Manchester was also a focal point in the race, with Ayotte repeatedly attacking Craig over her governing of Manchester, which she claimed led to an increase of homelessness and drug abuse issues. Craig fought back by touting her work in Manchester to combat those issues.\n\nAyotte was challenged during her campaign because of her tumultuous relationship with former President Donald Trump. In 2016, many believe her reversal of her endorsement of Trump is what caused her to lose reelection for Senate to Sen. Maggie Hassan. While she endorsed Trump this year, she largely attempted to distance herself from the former president. In early returns, it appeared as if her strategy was working, as she outperformed Trump in several districts.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nRep. Chris Pappas wins reelection, defeated by Russell Prescott\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas defeated Republican Russell Prescott, a former Executive Council member, in the race for New Hampshire’s First Congressional District.\n\n“We built a powerful coalition of Democrats, independents and, yes, Republicans too, who are all tired of division and cynicism and the partisanship in our politics, and they want leaders who are going to put New Hampshire first, and that's what I intend to do.,” said Pappas at a watch party at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester. “I am truly honored by the vote of confidence from the people of New Hampshire to continue our work for the next two years.”\n\nFirst elected in 2018, Pappas has served three terms in Congress. While the district has historically been a swing district, Pappas has dominated in recent years by appealing to voters across the political spectrum. While Prescott was a less pro-Trump Republican than Pappas’ past opponents, Prescott was still unable to upset the popular incumbent.\n\nSpeaking about his loss to WMUR, Prescott emphasized the civility of the race.\n\n“I’m glad it was Chris Pappas and I talking about the issues, and when we did disagree, we did it just we didn't disagree in a way that we offended each other,” Prescott said to WMUR about his loss. “You can talk about the issues without becoming something so negative that people don't understand that politics should not be that way. So, I wanted to show them how it could be.”\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nMaggie Goodlander wins NH seat in US House\n\nDemocrat Maggie Goodlander has won the New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District seat, defeating Republican Lily Tang Williams. Goodlander will take outgoing Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster’s place in Congress.\n\nGoodlander is a former senior adviser in the Biden administration who is married to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. She has also served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, was a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer and then Chief Judge Merrick Garland and worked as an adviser to U.S. Sens. John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. This will be her first elected position.\n\n\"Thank you to the people of New Hampshire’s Second District,\" Goodlander wrote on X. \"Whether you voted for me or not, I will work for you in the People’s House and fight for you with everything I’ve got. It is the honor of my lifetime to be elected to represent the district that made me who I am.\"\n\nGoodlander is a Nashua native who comes from a family of prominent Republicans in the state.\n\nDespite facing criticism for her strong DC connections, Goodlander held a wide lead in polls over Tang Williams, a businesswoman who grew up under Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution in China.\n\nNH state Senate results in Seacoast districts\n\nAll five incumbent New Hampshire state senators in greater Seacoast area districts won re-election, and Republicans will retain majority.\n\nDistrict 4: Democratic incumbent Sen.

From early morning rain to midday sun, bottles of water, pizzas and snacks were handed to voters as they endured the waiting period. There was even a cameo by the town’s emotional support dog.\n\nSelectwoman Carleigh Beriont, who was last in line a couple minutes past 8 p.m., said it was the “combination of record high turnout and limited options for checking voters in and moving them through” that caused the delay.\n\nShe cited electronic poll books now being used in some New Hampshire towns and cities to check in voters.\n\n“So the electronic polling books… there were five stations at the beginning of the day and I believe they brought in more now that the absentee ballots have been processed,” she added. “But that just limits how many people (can check in at a time).”\n\nAt times during the day, Beriont said, election officials let people into the high school building to use the bathroom due to the long waiting period, adding they also kept an eye out to accommodate anyone with mobility issues, small children or elderly people with health issues.\n\n“A lot of people really care, and they care enough to stand out here… to make sure their voice is heard,” Beriont said. \"And I think that’s incredibly satisfying to see as an elected official and as an American.”\n\nAt 8 p.m, police redirected traffic, preventing any cars from entering the parking lot, though those who were already in the parking lot were allowed to get in line and cast their votes.\n\nAlan Hartnett, 74, said he has voted in Hampton his whole life, but noted that “this is the longest time I’ve waited… usually I go in in 60 seconds and it takes about 10 minutes.” Hartnett, who was in line at 6:45 p.m., waited for a little over an hour before casting his vote.\n\nHowever, he said he stayed in line to have a say in the future of his country, noting that he “wanted to see a woman, a Black woman get elected president.”\n\nIn line with Hartnett was Steve Brigandi, who echoed similar sentiments. He said he wanted to be part of a “historic election.”\n\n“I will never see this again in my life,” said Brigandi, adding, “because of everyone that’s running… Everyone has their candidate, there’s lines not just here, but all of the United States. So I wasn’t (frustrated), I wanted to come not just for the president, but for the governor and for all our state reps, too.”\n\nSelectman Richard Sawyer said while there were some voters who made snide comments to election officials, he wanted to remind them that they are all volunteers who are “trying to make this work.”\n\n“We’re not saying (the system) is perfect, but the people that are here are volunteers so maybe hold back some of the negative commentary towards them and offer some constructive criticism at the appropriate time after the election,” he added.\n\nThe town registered a population of 16,424 in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Sawyer said 2024 brought higher turnout rates than previous elections.\n\n“2016 was a big (election), 2020 was big,” he added. “But this year is dwarfing those… There’s a lot at stake, it’s a lot of people that have strong emotions on both sides about all the issues.”\n\nBeriont, member of the Select Board, noted Tuesday’s election is a lesson for the town to improve their voting system.\n\n“I think we were expecting this many people to come, but I think there’s just definite limits on how many people we can move through given the way that the system is currently configured,” she said. “So (this) definitely calls for a reconfiguration.”\n\n— Aqeel Hisham\n\nAG: Election worker assaulted in Somersworth\n\nSOMERSWORTH — The New Hampshire attorney general’s office announced it received a report that a male assaulted an election worker at the Somersworth Ward 3 location at the city's high school and Somersworth police responded. The AG's office will be investigating.\n\nThis item may be updated.\n\nDurham absentee votes count begins after delay\n\nDURHAM — The process of counting absentee ballots in Durham began after 8 p.m. Tuesday after being delayed by a citizens petition. The petition was rejected by the town moderator, Chris Regan, under the guidance of the attorney general's office, allowing the ballots to be officially processed after hours of delay.\n\nThe citizen protest petition was submitted and certified by the town clerk Tuesday before 8 a.m. Michael Garrity, spokesperson for the attorney general's office, said, \"Durham will wait to process its absentee ballots until the polls close and they have taken steps to make sure they can process as quickly as possible once the polls do close.\"\n\nBrenda Towne, a representative of the group that filed the absentee ballot protest petition, presented Durham election moderator Regan with the citizen group’s submission- a single document showing the names of approximately 1,100 Durham voters who cast absentee ballots the group was disputing.\n\nRegan swiftly rejected it.Towne, an East Wakefield resident, claimed the group is using the petition as a way to raise awareness of a lack of voter identification needed to submit an absentee ballot in New Hampshire.\n\n“We have an entirely different category of voters who are being treated entirely differently,” she said. “We’re not trying to disenfranchise or take anyone’s vote away.”\n\nBrendan O’Donnell, head of the New Hampshire attorney general office’s Election Law Unit, addressed the situation in a message shared with town officials Tuesday. He stated the moderator can rule if the challenge was 'well-grounded.\"\n\nTodd Selig, town administrator, noted the citizens’ petition was a first-of-its-kind appeal for Durham.\n\nPoll workers and town staff are typically wrapped up around 11 p.m. on days of primary and general elections, he said. Selig expected the remainder of the night to proceed without any hiccups, with poll workers verifying absentee ballots before submitting them all into the ballot counting machines in the Oyster River High School gymnasium.\n\nAt night’s end, roughly 8,600 ballots are expected to be cast in Durham, about 1,000 less than the 2016 election but approximately 1,000 more than in 2020, according to Selig. The college town additionally saw about 2,400 same-day registrations filed Tuesday, over 1,300 less than in 2020.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nRochester city clerk assures voters after accident near Ward 5 polls\n\nROCHESTER — The city clerk's office issued a statement Tuesday after a motor vehicle accident on Wakefield Street led to \"increased traffic delays for voters attempting to reach the Ward 5 polling location at the James W. Foley Memorial Community Center.\" The clerk assured \"any voters impacted will still have the opportunity to cast their ballots.\"\n\nAny voter in line by the 7 p.m. closing time will be permitted to vote as usual, the clerk noted, adding voters who arrive after 7 p.m. would be allowed to vote until 7:30 p.m. The clerk added any ballots cast during extended hours will be petitioned to the state secretary of state.\n\n“Despite the circumstances, we encourage all eligible voters to participate and we will stay open,” stated the city clerk's announcement. “Everyone in line before 7:30 p.m. will have the chance to vote.”\n\nFor inquiries, call the Rochester city clerk’s office at (603) 332-2130.\n\nKamala Harris supporters in Portsmouth share hopes, anxiety\n\nPORTSMOUTH — In elections past, a consistent place for voters to congregate is in the heart of Market Square, with advocates for presidential, gubernatorial and local candidates frequently lining along the brick sidewalks downtown.\n\nThat familiar scene played out on Tuesday afternoon, albeit with a limited group of sign-holders. In front of the historic North Church, two supporters of the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz Democratic ticket spoke about their fears of a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nNicole Tuchman, an Iraq war veteran, and Pip Clews, both Portsmouth residents, have been friends for nearly 30 years. Clews said she is “nauseously optimistic” Harris will pull through to become the first woman, first Black woman and first South Asian American elected president.\n\n“The alternative is terrifying,” Clews said.\n\nPositioned next to big block letters spelling out “Harris,” Tuchman noted she hasn’t slept well in recent days and wasn’t eating much of her Ceres Bakery takeout Tuesday due to her nerves.\n\n“There’s nothing good I can say about him being president,” Tuchman said.\n\nA sole Trump supporter, carrying a sign and wearing a flag themed for the Republican presidential nominee, stood on the corner of Market Square opposite the Harris supporters. He declined to comment.\n\nCars passing through downtown Portsmouth late afternoon honked in support of both candidates. Recent polling has indicated Harris holds a steady lead over Trump in New Hampshire.\n\nClews and Tuchman hope that within a few days time, similar to in 2020, Democratic voters will descend upon Market Square to celebrate the election of Harris and Walz.\n\n“Everything will change if he becomes president,” Clews said of Trump.\n\nClews is a member of the Portsmouth School Board but emphasized she is advocating for the Democratic nominee as a private citizen.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nVoter challenged at polls in Durham\n\nDURHAM — A voter was challenged Tuesday by an observer at the polls at Oyster River High School, where many University of New Hampshire students were voting.\n\nVoter registration is a hot topic in the college town, as some students who vote are from out of state, which is legal but opposed by some. According to Todd Selig, town administrator, the town typically has about 3,000 same-day voter registrations for presidential elections, and he had been anticipating challenges.\n\nAccording to town moderator Chris Regan, a voter with an out-of-state driver's license had previously voted in the presidential primary election in January, and had the same license when voting Tuesday. Observers of the voter registration process flagged this, arguing the person should have obtained a New Hampshire license to vote.\n\nSecretary of State David Scanlan, who visited the Durham polls Tuesday, confirmed voters who claim a New Hampshire address as their domicile, meaning they live in the state the majority of the year, are expected to have a New Hampshire driver's license.\n\n\"It may or may not have violated motor vehicle laws, [but] it does not disqualify you to vote in the election,\" said Regan.\n\nScanlan agreed, but noted laws are complicated and each voter registration that requires review needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDick Swett, a former New Hampshire U.S. congressman, accompanied Scanlan at the Durham polls.\n\nSwett said he is working on a project called Defend Democracy, a mission to re-instill confidence in voters that elections are accurate and fair with New Hampshire as a model for having a high rate of voter confidence.\n\n\"Local voting officials keep our trust in New Hampshire,\" Swett said.\n\n— Sarah Donovan\n\nUNH students vote with excitement\n\nDURHAM — Sawyer Swenson, a University of New Hampshire student, dressed as George Washington as he voted.\n\n\"George Washington was the first president, of course, and you know voting is very important. No matter who you vote for, it doesn't matter, I mean it does matter, but you should just show up to vote in the first place,\" said Swenson.\n\nHe said he voted \"mostly blue.\"\n\nMatas Aleksas, a first-time voter, said he came out to vote as he recently turned 18 and had been looking forward to it.\n\nAleksas voted because \"it represents your beliefs ... and putting your voice out there.\"\n\nAva Bernacchi, a UNH sophomore, has helped the New Hampshire Democratic Party and worked with state Rep. Loren Selig, D-Durham, for the primary election. She also worked with Katheryn Mone's campaign for Strafford County sheriff.\n\n\"I was super excited to vote for them, especially voting for all women down the ballot as well is just super cool,\" said Bernacchi.\n\n\"I woke up this morning and felt very emotional because with how important this campaign is, it feels like I've gotta do my duty and get out there and vote,\" said Bernacchi.\n\n— Sarah Donovan\n\nJoyce Craig greets supporters in Exeter\n\nEXETER — Joyce Craig, the Democratic nominee for governor, dropped by the polls at Talbot Gym Tuesday to thank her supporters, noting the “positive energy” as the crowd cheered and shouted her name.\n\n“I feel like we have motivation and momentum on our side, as we’ve been knocking doors and meeting people over the last few days,\" Craig said. \"We’ve heard the support and encouragement and we’re feeling really, really good.”\n\nCraig said while campaigning voters expressed concerns about affordable housing, reproductive freedom and public school funding – and that she’s “focused on solutions” to these key issues.\n\nCraig was joined at the polls by Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan and Congressman Chris Pappas.\n\n“It’s really energizing to see the crowds today in New Hampshire,” said Pappas. “People are turning out and doing their civic duty, and I think that bodes well for our democracy and our ability to come together when it’s over, to solve problems and to move our state and our country forward.”\n\nVoter turnout had been heavy since polls opened at 7 a.m., said town moderator Kate Miller, noting that 3,942 people, nearly a third of Exeter’s registered voters, had cast their votes by 2 p.m. The number does not reflect absentee ballots and ballots that need to be hand counted, she added. In 2022, Exeter had 12,144 registered voters.\n\nClad in a blue shirt and holding a Kamala Harris sign, Charles Fanning said the “substantial issues” that brought him out to the polls were the uncertainty of women’s reproductive rights and gun safety.\n\nFanning said the result of the election will be a choice between two different futures for the country: “We’re either going to move forward with democracy where the people are an important part of what happens in our government, or we’re going to move forward with a dictatorship.”\n\nAcross the way from Fanning, Fred Bird, a U.S. Air Force veteran, said the lack of border control has become a pressing issue for the country, noting that Donald Trump would change that.\n\n“I was in the service for nine years… and I served in West Germany for four years and I was securing their border and nobody’s securing my border,” he said. “Everybody’s welcome to come to America, every single person, but you have to knock on the front door. I wouldn’t let you come into my house unless you knock at the front door.”\n\nOne of the platforms that Vice President Kamala Harris has been running on is her initiatives on helping middle-class families. However, Bird said, people shouldn't rely on the government to help them.\n\n“It’s not up to the government to take care of you, it’s not America, it’s not a socialist country,” he added. “The government is not supposed to give you health care, it’s not supposed to give you housing, it’s not supposed to take care of you… You shouldn’t expect the whole nation to help everybody, everybody should help themselves and help their neighbors.”\n\n— Aqeel Hisham\n\nRochester, Somersworth voting wards randomly chosen for NH audit\n\nTwo wards in local communities have been randomly selected by the New Hampshire secretary of state for post-Election Day audits.\n\nBallot counting devices from Ward 2 in Rochester and Ward 4 in Somersworth will be reviewed. The Rochester audit will be conducted on Wednesday at 1 p.m. in Concord, while the one for Somersworth will be held Thursday at 8 a.m., according to Secretary of State David Scanlan.\n\nThe announcement states: “The moderators in each location were notified after polls opened on November 5. Just one device from each location will be audited. The audits are open to the public and media.”\n\nSeveral Seacoast and Strafford County area election moderators - Rochester state Sen. Jim Gray, Portsmouth state Rep. Joan Hamblet and Durham moderator Chris Regan - have been chosen for the audits.\n\nBallot counting devices from Bedford, Hudson, Laconia, Manchester, Moultonborough and Walpole were also selected at random for the audits.\n\nA report on the audits will be published online by the secretary of state’s office on Friday.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nKelly Ayotte, Joyce Craig both upbeat on NH governor's race\n\nAfter casting her vote at Webster Elementary School in Manchester, Democratic candidate and former Mayor of Manchester Joyce Craig said she feels “great.\" She said voters know what is “on the line” and that they are “ showing up to make sure that we are addressing what needs to happen in New Hampshire.”\n\nAt McLaughlin Middle School in Manchester, Republican candidate and former US Sen. Kelly Ayotte was not taking questions from the press, but her campaign spokesman John Corbett said that they are having a “great response” wherever they go and that the enthusiasm is high.\n\nManchester Mayor Jay Ruais, a Republican who was out supporting Ayotte at the middle school, said that the turnout is “sky high.”\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said, referring to the lines. “I went to [Wards] 7, 12, 10 and 1, and they've all been like: this around the corner outside the block.”\n\nThe polls have shown a very close race between the candidates, with Ayotte maintaining a slight lead in polls.\n\n“We’ve worked hard the last year and a half,” Craig said, when asked whether the tight polls give her any concern. “We've done our job, and now, you know, we'll see what the voters have to say.”\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nLong lines have Hampton voters waiting\n\nHAMPTON — Since 7 a.m., hundreds of people lined up around Winnacunnet High School to carry out their civic duty. The one-hour line, which wraps nearly half-a-mile around the building, is the longest one Police Chief Alex Reno said he has witnessed in his 23 years in town.\n\n“They are waiting in line for about 40-50 minutes, but so far everything has been civil and no issues,” he added.\n\nBy 11 a.m., Town Moderator Mark Gorayeb said 2,234 votes had been cast with nearly 600 new registered voters.\n\nClad in a red jacket and MAGA hat while holding a “Trump” sign, Jim Bennett’s hope for this election was clear, noting he wants “a stronger economy, lower fuel prices… safer border.”\n\n“We’re either gonna become pretty much a socialist country if Kamala Harris gets in, and if Trump gets in, we’re gonna still have our freedom and we’ll remain a republic… where everybody’s votes count under a democracy,” he said. “We need to remain a Republican where everybody is involved in the process.”\n\nOn the other side of the electioneering section, Julie Moore said her support for Vice President Kamala Harris stems from her concern for democracy as well as women’s reproductive rights.\n\n“It’s going to be paramount,” she said, referring to the outcome of the election. “I don’t want to quote the other side, but it’s just been scary with all the tactics that have been put up for us to see and to read and look at,\" referring to Project 2025.\n\nHowever, if the election results were to swing to Trump, Moore doesn’t think that there will be trouble.\n\n“It won’t be the Democrats, that isn’t who we are at the core,” she said. “We have to accept the outcome.”\n\n— Aqeel Hisham\n\nFirst-time voter cheered at Portsmouth High School polls\n\nPORTSMOUTH — Sharon Nichols bustled through three long lines of voters in the Portsmouth High School gymnasium to find a young man donning a maroon sweatshirt Tuesday. Her mission? Confirming he was a first time-voter.\n\nAfter he answered in the affirmative, Nichols put her hands high in the air and yelled out, “First-time voter!” Her cheers were met with clapping and whooping from other voters.\n\nEvery election, she seeks out young people throughout the day and praises them for their civic engagement.\n\n“I love it. I love the fact that people are affirming their privilege to vote. We're lucky to live in a country where it’s a democracy, and everybody has the right to vote, and every vote counts,” Nichols said.\n\nIt’s the third time Nichols, a moderator for the last eight years, is leading the Ward 4 election process during a presidential election.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be high in Ward 4 on Tuesday, with Nichols and her team of volunteers prepared to see 80% of registered voters cast ballots. The presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is the key reason for the anticipated high turnout and the main reason the polling place was moved to the high school, rather than at the smaller Mary C. Dondero Elementary School, where the ward’s elections are typically held.\n\nNew voter registrations spiked in the ward during the September primary, according to Nichols.\n\n“Typically in Ward 4, we're lucky if we get 40% (turnout), but during the primaries, we had a lot of people register as first-time voters. A lot of young people, and we had a lot of women register during the primary,” Nichols said. “So we knew it was going to be a high turnout with first-time voters, and it's definitely a high turnout with women. We have a lot of older voters, too.”\n\nA steady stream of residents moved in and out of the Andrew Jarvis Drive school Tuesday morning. By 9:45 p.m., 405 ballots had been submitted, and the team was preparing to begin counting the roughly 160 mail-in ballots cast in the ward.\n\nThis is a consequential election,” Nichols said. “It’s tighter than I've ever seen in terms of the numbers.”\n\nPortsmouth is historically liberal-leaning in state and presidential elections. Tuesday morning, just two men held signs outside, both encouraging down-ballot votes for Democrats.\n\nThe polls in Portsmouth opened at 8 a.m. Tuesday and will close at 8 p.m.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nNew Hampshire election results will be reported live\n\nLive results, including winners being called, will be updated live as follows after polls close and votes are counted:\n\nNH races to watch: Live results from president to state government\n\nNH governor: Live results for Kelly Ayotte vs. Joyce Craig\n\nNH U.S. House: Live results from Pappas vs. Prescott and Goodlander vs. Williams\n\nNH state Senate: Live results in all districts\n\nNH state House: Live results in all districts\n\nNH Executive Council: Live results for District 1 and District 3\n\n'I Voted' stickers brought to you by NH fourth-graders\n\nPORTSMOUTH — The in-person Election Day voting experience in New Hampshire can include buying treats from bake sales, catching up with neighbors and leaving with “I Voted” stickers.\n\nThis year’s stickers look a little different.\n\nIn summer of the 2023, New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan and his team started the inaugural “I Voted” student sticker contest for fourth-graders across the Granite State. Over 1,000 entries from New Hampshire fourth grade students were submitted, and three were selected as the winners.\n\nA Milton student drew the legendary late Old Man of the Mountain backdropped by the American flag in her design. A fourth-grader from Auburn was selected for his cartoon of New Hampshire fishing, while the third winner, a Mont Vernon student, drew a moose overlooking a valley amid fall foliage. All have the phrase “I Voted.\"\n\nScanlan’s office announced the three winners in October 2023. Each of the three students’ designs have been distributed on stickers throughout the 2024 election cycle.\n\n— Ian Lenahan\n\nSen. Shaheen speaks out on reproductive rights at Dover polls\n\nDOVER — Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, made an appearance at Woodman Park Elementary School Tuesday morning, the city's Ward 3 for voting, with her supporters.\n\n\"I think people are concerned by reproductive rights,\" Shaheen said, touting the issue Democrats have been focusing on this election cycle. Shaheen is out supporting Democrats as her term runs through 2026.\n\nShaheen noted she has daughters and granddaughters, and she wants to ensure they have the same reproductive rights that were protected by Roe v. Wade before it was overturned in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Shaheen said she is seeing a gap of understanding between women over 65 who knew what things were like before Roe, where legal abortions were not protected and there were deaths from \"back alley\" abortions, versus younger people who had not previously experienced a nation with about the guaranteed right to an abortion in every state.\n\n\"I think it's a big issue not just for women, but for husbands and sons,\" said Shaheen.\n\nRepublicans have countered New Hampshire's law allowing abortions up until 24 weeks is appropriate.\n\nModerator Gary Gilmore said the turnout was the highest he's seen in the 20 years he's been an election worker.\n\nAs of 10 a.m., Ward 3 had seen 1,100 ballots cast, which is already a 40%-50% turnout, said Gilmore.\n\n— Sarah Donovan\n\nDover Ward 1 voters share views on Trump, Harris and future of nation\n\nDOVER — Affordable housing, lowering crime, the border, social welfare and global affairs were issues voters were focused on Tuesday morning at the heavily Democratic city's Ward 1 polls at Frances G. Hopkins at Horne Street Elementary School.\n\nCandace Williams and Andy Holtz, both on the executive committee for the Dover Democrats, shared why they were supporting Kamala Harris.\n\n\"She's showed not just a vision for America, but the world. That vision isn't just for the world, but for our Democratic allies,\" said Holtz.\n\nHoltz referenced Harris' support of Ukraine, and allies such as NATO in addition to her support of tax credits for families, the economy and small businesses.\n\nDavid Huppe, who said he is retired Rochester police officer, stood outside the school with signs in support of Donald Trump for president, and Kelly Ayotte for governor.\n\n\"He's done great on the border and he'll do it again,\" said Huppe, stating border patrol as one of his main reasons for supporting Trump.\n\nShannon Merrill said, \"I came out because I want the next four years to better.\" Merrill referenced wanting to be able to buy a home, lowering crime and the economy as to reasons why she's voting.\n\n\"I'd like to be able to buy a house at some point,\" said Sully Freer, a young voter new to Dover and New Hampshire, originally from North Carolina.\n\nAccording to moderator Chris Haugen, there were about 450 ballots cast by 8:15 a.m. With 3,350 registered voters in the ward, he's expecting about an 80% turnout.\n\n— Sarah Donovan\n\nManchester voters line up with city at heart of Craig vs. Ayotte NH governor's race\n\nThe line was already out the door, down the stairs and headed out onto the sidewalk at Webster Elementary School in Manchester at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nManchester has been a focal point of the New Hampshire governor’s race, with Republican Kelly Ayotte heavily criticizing the way Democrat Joyce Craig ran the city as mayor. For her part, Craig has touted her achievements in the city.\n\nInterest in the competitive races for governor and president, along with down-ballot races, was evident. Manchester Ward 1 Selectman Jim Townsman said that the turnout was “quite robust” and “exciting.” He said that more than 400 people cast their ballots in the first hour.\n\nStanding in line, Ashley Marcoux said she is voting for Craig.\n\n“I really appreciate everything that she did in the city,” said Marcoux, a registered Democrat. “I think that she's going to be an incredible governor and protect women's rights and also bring our economy into the future.”\n\nEric Brown, a registered Republican, was holding a sign for Ayotte along the stairs into the polling place.\n\n“I’ve lived in Manchester now for over 10 years. So before Joyce Craig, during Joyce Craig when she was mayor, and now after, and I saw the decline in our city, the homelessness crisis, the drug epidemic, and I didn't think that her solutions were working,” Brown said. “So I'm supporting Kelly, because I think, especially as a former prosecutor and attorney general, she'll be someone that's good to help clean up our streets and a good partnership with with our current mayor, Jay Ruais.”\n\nKelly Ayotte vs. Joyce Craig:6 issues may decide close NH governor's race\n\nBoth voters said as the biggest city in the state, they understood Manchester being a central part of the race. Marcoux said that voters in Manchester are focused on economic and social issues. Brown said that it’s good to highlight the issues in the city.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nTrash talk hits polls in Manchester\n\nCamille Craffey stood outside McLaughlin Middle School in Manchester offering mini trash cans to people waiting in line to vote.\n\n“I am a big fan of making something negative positive,” said Craffey, a realtor and veteran. “So when our current President, Joe Biden, supposedly, said that all Trump supporters are garbage, I thought, what better way to flip the script?”\n\nShe put the tiny red garbage cans in bags with an American flag, a Trump sticker, and her business card.\n\nThe “trash” talk has been circulating among both parties since comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27.\n\nIn a video call with Latino activists, Biden responded to those comments, saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”\n\nDebate has swirled about whether Biden was referring to Hinchcliffe or Trump’s supporters.\n\nOn Sunday at a rally in Derry, New Hampshire, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for Biden’s “garbage” rhetoric, and then referred to her as “trash.”\n\n“In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\n— Margie Cullen\n\nRochester voters line up early, Trump supporters speak up\n\nROCHESTER — At 8 a.m., there was no parking readily available at the James W. Foley Memorial Community Center and a long line of voters already had formed. People were circling the lot looking for a space.\n\nDeputy Mayor Don Hamann said there was already a line when he arrived at 7:30, a half hour before the polls opened.\n\n“I am 73 and I have never missed an election. I think this one will be really busy all day. It has been nonstop since it started,\" Hamann said, adding he had no predictions on results.\n\nNaomi LaBonte, 12, is too young to vote but said, if she could, she would vote for Trump. Her mom, Jessica, agreed. “We need to get back the America we love. We need to stop living paycheck to paycheck.”\n\nWaiting in line, Clyde Holland said “When the turnout is this big, it means change and that is what we need.\"\n\nFirst-time voter Dylan White said he has been watching the politics and the speeches, deciding Trump was the best choice. No one wanted to predict the governor’s race, saying it was too close to call. Most thought Ayotte’s name recognition would give her the edge.\n\n— Karen Dandurant\n\nDixville Notch, NH vote: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris tie\n\nDIXVILLE, N.H. — The voting in Dixville Notch fell in line with the national polls on Tuesday night in a race that couldn’t be any closer. Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris split the vote 3-3 to open Election Day in the 2024 race.\n\nThe tie is the first in Dixville Notch since 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney split the vote 5-5 among the 10 registered voters.\n\nVoting took place at midnight in Dixville Notch on Tuesday, a unique tradition in New Hampshire that began in 1960. Six voters, including four registered Republicans and two undeclared, cast their ballots.\n\nThe results are declared first at Dixville Notch, the \"first in the nation\" vote for the presidential election. The press flooded into The Balsams Resort at the Tillotson House in Dixville, covering a nationally televised event on stations like CNN and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as there were more media covering the event than there were voters casting their ballots.\n\nWhat is New Hampshire midnight voting?:The history of one town's quirky tradition\n\nDonald Trump has typically struggled in Dixville Notch but this year earned a split in the tight battleground state of New Hampshire. The split goes against a common trend at Dixville Notch. President Joe Biden won all five votes cast by Dixville Notch voters in the 2020 presidential election. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton defeated the Republican candidate 4-2 in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHarris and Trump aim to carry their momentum from Dixville Notch into today’s rambunctious Election Day. As the candidates made their final arguments, the nation is one day closer to knowing the final results of this incredibly tight race.\n\n— Colin Struckman, Franklin Pierce University\n\nReport from Dixville Notch is shared by partners in the Granite State News Collaborative.

You must fill out a voter registration form and show proof of identity, age, citizenship and having established a domicile. If you don’t have the documents with you on Election Day, you may prove those qualifications by completing an affidavit.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan is expecting a high number of voters to register at the polls on Election Day.\n\nWhat should I bring to the polls?\n\nIf you’re registering to vote for the first time at the polls, you’ll need to bring electronic or printed copies of documents that prove you meet the age, citizenship, identity, and domicile requirements. A New Hampshire driver’s license with your current address would prove many of these requirements, but you’ll still need a form of birth certificate, U.S. passport, naturalization papers, or a record confirming that you are a US citizen who was born abroad to satisfy the citizenship requirement.\n\nHowever, if you don’t have proper identification, you can still vote with something called an “Affidavit Ballot.”\n\nWhat can I wear to the polls?\n\nYou can wear anything you want, as long as nothing suggests support of a certain candidate or party. A MAGA hat or a Harris T-shirt, for example, would not be allowed at a polling place.\n\nThat’s because it would be considered a form of electioneering, which means to work for the success of a particular candidate, party, or issue in an election, and it is not permitted inside a polling place under New Hampshire law.\n\nViolators are subject to a fine of up to $1,000. More details on electioneering can be found here.\n\nWill there be lines at my polling place?\n\nLocal election officials say there may be lines when registering to vote or voting at polling places. However, the secretary of state has directed all polling places to keep wait times under 30 minutes.\n\nWhen will we see election results?\n\nThe results tallying process takes place in the polls immediately after they close. A continuous process, the moderator will publicly announce the results after they have been tallied and reconciled. Any member of the public can observe this process.\n\nScanlan expects polling places to announce results the night of the election or into the early hours of the following morning.\n\nHowever, it’s possible the national result of the presidential election will not be announced on election night. Polls show the election between Harris and Trump to be very tight, and, in some states, counting the votes and certifying the results can take days, or even weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/12/15/greenland-nh-first-vote-state-wide-effort-ban-voting-machines-2020-election-fraud-claim/6502920001/", "title": "Greenland to hold first NH vote on effort to ban voting machines", "text": "GREENLAND — Proponents of a statewide effort to get cities and towns to ban the use of voting counting machines in New Hampshire say it's a way to restore \"integrity\" in future elections.\n\nThose who oppose this change to the way election results are counted have called it a ruse to undermine voter confidence in the election system by solving a problem that doesn't exist.\n\nGreenland will hold a special town election Saturday, Dec. 18 on the citizen petition filed by Douglas Wilson and 51 registered voters calling on the town to revert back to the hand counting of all paper ballot votes. The petition in Greenland required only 50 signatures to call the special vote because the town's population is less than 10,000 (it's 4,067, according to 2020 Census).\n\n\"I believe there is merit to consider banning the machines we use solely in the interest of caution,\" Wilson explained at the town's Nov. 13 deliberative session on why he filed the petition. \"I have full confidence in the town of Greenland and the poll watchers. ... When it comes to the machines, I don't know.\"\n\nThe vote on the petition will take place from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Greenland Central School.\n\nSimilar attempts to ban the voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington. There is also a statewide bill to do away with voting machines filed by state Rep. Mark Alliegro, R-Campton.\n\nCasting doubt:Hampton selectman joins effort to remove NH voting machines\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu said in response to recent petitions that the elections in New Hampshire last year were \"safe, secure, and reliable.\"\n\n\"Over 800,000 votes were cast in New Hampshire last November,\" he said in a prepared statement provided to Seacoastonline. \"There were 16 recounts, and all verified the winners. New Hampshire’s election process continues to be a model for the rest of the country.\"\n\nNH election official calls machines 'strong workhorses'\n\nDavid Scanlan, New Hampshire's deputy secretary of state, said it is left up to the cities and towns whether they want to use voting machines.\n\nHe said more than half of the cities and towns do and use AccuVote-OS PC (Optical Scan Precinct Count) machines, which are the only vote counting machines currently allowed in the state.\n\nScanlan said in the more than 30 years the machines have been in use, there have been no major issues with their reliability, calling them \"strong workhorses.\"\n\n\"As long as the voter properly marks the oval on the ballot, the machine will accurately read them,\" Scanlan said. \"Where there have been issues in the past with large discrepancies, it's usually the result of human error.\"\n\nAnd if there is ever a question, he said, that is why the state requires paper ballots. Under state law, the ballots are hand-counted when there is a recount.\n\n\"So we will always have that as backup,\" he said.\n\nHe said the AccuVote machines are completely disconnected from the Internet. In 2010, the state required all modems in the machines to be disconnected and all ports permanently disabled and sealed.\n\n\"The only cord that comes out of it, that is of any use, is the power cord,\" Scanlan said.\n\nWhile the state has confidence in the AccuVote machines, the state Ballot Law Commission is currently looking at approving two new machines, one manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems and another by Election Systems & Software.\n\nScanlan said the main reason new machines are being considered is AccuVote machines are no longer being manufactured.\n\n\"They're aging and they are not making parts for them anymore,\" Scanlan said.\n\nWho is behind movement to ban machines?\n\nThe movement to ban the machines is being promoted by so-called \"non-partisan\" political groups such as the Marigold Coffee Club as part of its “Remove the Machines” campaign and members of the NH Voter Integrity Group, who are behind a statewide effort to convince legislators to order a full forensic audit of the 2020 election.\n\nDoubt in the elections has been fueled by former President Donald Trump, who maintains without evidence a claim there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, including in New Hampshire, and conspiracy theories the voting machines are susceptible to hacks.\n\nState Rep. Joan Hamblet, a Democrat who represents Greenland, Newington, North Hampton and Portsmouth Ward 3, said she believes the recent petitions are nothing more than an attempt to cast doubt on elections.\n\nAs the moderator for Portsmouth Ward 3, she has no concerns with the reliability of the machines.\n\n\"The AccuVote machines are accurate and reliable,\" she said. \"We can follow up on the voting with paper ballots. That's our security.\n\n\"There is a whole myth about fraud. It's a myth, there is no fraud in New Hampshire elections.\"\n\nCould what happened in Windham occur again?\n\nIn Hampton, those behind the petition to ban the voting machines point to what occurred in the Nov. 3, 2020, election in Windham, New Hampshire as a reason to return to hand-counting.\n\nA hand-counted recount of an eight-person race for four state representative seats showed winning Republican candidates getting hundreds more votes than were originally counted by the machine.\n\n\"That was a human factor that came into play,\" said Scanlan on the discrepancy.\n\nA state-approved audit on Windham's ballot-counting machines and hand tabulations released in July 2021 revealed the cause of the discrepancy was not the AccuVote machine but a separate letter folding device used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nMore:Auditors find no fraud in disputed Windham, New Hampshire election\n\nThe folding device, the auditors Harri Hursti, Mark Lindeman and Philip Stark wrote, folded the ballots in the wrong place. Instead of folding the ballots on the score lines between vote targets as intended, it folded through vote bubbles in the state representative contest causing miscalculations when they were fed into the voting machines.\n\nLinda McGrath, of Hampton, said if the ballots were hand-counted in the first place there wouldn't have been an issue.\n\n\"The machines are unreliable,\" she said in October.\n\n'Chain of custody' in question\n\nIn Greenland, the only person to speak in favor of banning the machines at the town's deliberative session was the petitioner Douglas Wilson.\n\nWilson expressed concern with the \"chain of custody\" of the machines and that cities and towns rely on an outside third party, LHS Associates of Salem, to maintain and service them.\n\nLHS Associates is responsible for programming the memory cards for each machine for each election (including contests, candidates, voting rules, and vote target locations) and provides the paper ballots.\n\n\"They are a third-party provider and they're the guardians of our sovereignty in this town,\" he said at the meeting. \"I don't know who they are. I don't know a lot about them.\"\n\nWhat is known about LHS Associates?\n\nLHS Associates president and CEO Jeffrey Silvestro addressed a number of concerns residents had regarding their safety protocols during a public hearing in Windham in March 2021.\n\n\"We have more than 25 years of supporting elections and we have done so accurately and securely and there are hundreds and hundreds of recounts, there are audits and all kinds of systems in place to prove the accuracy of these elections,\" said Silvestro.\n\nHe said their building in Salem is locked down 24/7 and everything is monitored with security cameras. All employees, he said, undergo a CORI, or criminal background check, as well annual training in cybersecurity.\n\n\"Every single programing terminal (for the memory cards) is disconnected from the Internet,\" he said. \"Nothing is connected to any network, their stand-alone systems. Our systems are also (subjected) to a post-election audit in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont and we push for those random audits because we feel it's important to the integrity of the system.\"\n\nThe reason why there is no post-election audit in New Hampshire is because there is no legislation directing one to occur. A bill is currently being considered that would allow voters in any AccuVote community to request a post-election audit.\n\nStrict protocols in place\n\nGreenland Town Moderator Dean Bouffard said towns and cities that use voter machines follow strict procedures established by the secretary of state's office and state law to ensure voter confidence in the results.\n\nHe said all the machines Greenland uses are locked in a safe at Town Hall when not in use.\n\nThe only thing removed from the machines is the memory card, which is sent to LHS Associates to be reprogrammed prior to the election.\n\n\"That's the only thing that leaves town hall,\" he said. \"The machine itself is in the town's vault all the time. If it needs service, an LHS mechanic will come to the town hall and perform the work there (in front of a representative from the town clerk's office).\"\n\nThe town clerk, he said, keeps a log detailing every time the machine receives service or if one of the numbered seals on the machine is removed and replaced. Similar logs are kept for the memory cards.\n\nPrior to each election, Bouffard said, Greenland like other cities and towns tests the machines in a session open to the public.

There’s a growing range of probes into his lies, with CNN reporting Wednesday night that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating his finances and local prosecutors are “looking into” his fabrications.\n\nThose falsehoods – several more of which CNN’s KFile uncovered on Wednesday – combined with Santos’ defiance and Republican leadership’s silence are setting up the GOP for a fraught first week in power.\n\nGOP leadership hasn’t even acknowledged the controversy, which is leading to fears among some of Santos’ fellow incoming congressmen from the Empire State that his issues could overshadow Republicans’ ascent to power.\n\n“Attempts to blame others or minimize his actions are only making things worse and a complete distraction from the task at hand,” Rep.-elect Mike Lawler said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n“New Yorkers deserve the truth and House Republicans deserve an opportunity to govern without this distraction,” said Rep.-elect Nick LaLota, who was elected to a Long Island district, in a statement Tuesday in which he called for an ethics investigation “and, if necessary, law enforcement” involvement.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who has not returned CNN’s requests for comment about Santos, has been focused on trying to secure the votes for the speakership next month. That task became harder after Republicans won a narrower majority than he had hoped, a slim margin that will empower the conference’s most extreme members. Asking Santos to step down could cost him a vote in his already tenuous quest to reach 218.\n\nBut by not addressing the New York Republican’s lies, McCarthy may risk looking like he’s not in control of his party before ever taking the speaker’s gavel.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40 - Source: CNN Analysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40\n\nProsecutors ‘looking into’ Santos’ lies as more false claims emerge\n\nHouse Republicans’ path to the majority this year ran through New York, which was a bright spot for the party in an otherwise disappointing midterm performance. While falling short of their anticipated “red wave,” the GOP flipped four Democratic seats in the Empire State – one of which was the 3rd District that Santos carried by about 8 points.\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday that he made even more false claims about his family history, work history and education, according to a KFile review of statements made in his 2022 and 2020 congressional campaigns. Santos has not responded to CNN’s repeated requests for comment.\n\nSantos admitted to the New York Post on Monday that he didn’t “graduate from any institution of higher learning,” despite his biography at times listing an education at Baruch College and New York University. He also admitted that he never worked directly for the financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as he has previously suggested, but claimed that he did do work for them through his company, telling the Post it was a “poor choice of words” to say he worked for them.\n\nThe Nassau County district attorney’s office said Wednesday it is “looking into” the fabrications.\n\n“No one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it,” District Attorney Anne Donnelly, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nProsecutors in the US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York are investigating Santos’ finances, a source familiar with the matter told CNN later Wednesday.

The claims from Santos that have earned the sharpest rebuke have been those about his proclaimed Jewish identity.\n\nSantos said in an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February that his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky – a claim for which there is no evidence and that records contradict, KFile reported on Wednesday.\n\nThat followed last week’s KFile revelations that Santos’ claims that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.\n\nHis explanation has quickly become the source of mockery.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the New York Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nAnd yet, Santos described himself as a “proud American Jew” in a document shared with Jewish groups during the campaign, which was first reported by the Forward and confirmed by CNN this week.\n\nThe backlash came swiftly from local corners of the GOP and quickly went to larger influential groups.\n\n“I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Santos, and I expected more than just a blanket apology,” Nassau County GOP Chair Joseph G. Cairo, Jr., said in a statement Tuesday. “The damage that his lies have caused to many people, especially those who have been impacted by the Holocaust, are profound.”\n\n“His fabrications regarding the Holocaust and his family’s history are particularly hurtful,” Rep.-elect Anthony D’Esposito of New York added in his own statement.\n\nAnd Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition – a powerful player in GOP national politics – said on Tuesday that Santos had “deceived us” and “will not be welcome at any future RJC event.”\n\nBut a week and a half after the initial revelations, most Republicans currently serving in the House are quiet, at least publicly.\n\nWith Congress out of session for the holidays, reporters can’t catch lawmakers in hallways of the Capitol. But they’ll be back next week, and it’s only a matter of time before members face pointed questions.\n\nOne member speaking up for Santos is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – not necessarily the defender that a New York Republican, whose district voted for President Joe Biden by 8 points in 2020, probably wants in his corner.\n\n“I think we Republicans should give George Santos a chance and see how he legislates and votes, not treat him the same as the left is,” the Georgia Republican wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhen Greene was stripped of her committee assignments early last year, in the wake of incendiary and violent past statements that had recently been unearthed, it was the Democratic-controlled House (along with 11 Republicans) who made that happen – not GOP leadership. And once again, leadership seems to be looking past the problem.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Did I embellish my resume?

Yes I did': GOP Rep.-elect speaks out about lying 01:04\n\nTrumpian tactics\n\nSantos brought this upon himself – and yet, like the former president who still wields major influence over the House GOP, he seems eager to deflect responsibility. At one point, he has even tried to explain away his actions by casting himself as a victim of America’s elites.\n\nIn a bizarre interview with City and State on Monday, he spoke about having “the weight of the world” on his shoulders over the past week as news organizations have pored over his background. He then said “elitists” had looked down on him for working in customer service, seeming to suggest that’s why he omitted that experience and fabricated others on his resume.\n\nAlthough there’s no evidence he’s ever been convicted of a crime, Santos has tried to obfuscate on the issue. He was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court, as the New York Times first reported last week and CNN confirmed on Wednesday, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. Court records from 2013, however, state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\n“I am not a criminal here – not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,” Santos told the Post on Monday.\n\nIn another classic Trump move, he pivoted to attacking Biden and Democrats in a Tuesday interview on Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” when the guest host, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, pressed him on the meaning of “integrity” and asked, “Do you have no shame?”\n\nBut in trying to defend the discrepancies in his record, Santos then made a statement that Gabbard seized on for the way it could offend the everyday Americans he claims to have so much affinity for.\n\n“We can have this discussion that’s going to go way above the American people’s head, but that’s not what I campaigned on,” Santos said.\n\nAs Gabbard rightly pointed out in that interview, he’s not the only politician – from either party – whose background, as they’ve presented it, has received scrutiny. Santos is clearly leaning into the unpopularity of the institution he’s planning to join as he tries to defend his record.\n\n“I challenge all 434 members of Congress, aside myself, in the House, to go through the same litany test I just went through last week,” he told City and State. “Open yourselves up to the media. Let them dig deep and pull in your deepest secrets. If we did that, we wouldn’t have a single congressman in the House. And I bet you, we wouldn’t have a single senator in the Senate.”\n\nJust 22% of Americans approved of Congress in Gallup’s latest survey this fall.

Does honesty and integrity matter at all? Or is GOP leadership so power-hungry that it will allow a serial fabulist to remain in office despite deceiving the public – and the voters who elected him – about key aspects of his biography?\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nWhile running for office, Santos, who was elected in a district in New York that encompasses Long Island suburbs and parts of Queens, had either lied or been strangely cagey about everything from where he lived to which college he graduated from to where he worked to what his religious background was.\n\nThe New York Times published an investigation of Santos’s web of lies earlier this month, and got a very Trumpian attack-the-messenger denial from Santos’ lawyer who, instead of providing any clarity or specific factual denials, simply said that it is “no surprise that Congressman-elect Santos has enemies at The New York Times who are attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.”\n\nA CNN KFile report, building on the Forward’s reporting, further revealed how he had apparently misrepresented his Jewish roots, claiming his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees who changed their last name to survive. But genealogist Megan Smolenyak told the KFile that “”There’s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.” Santos’ lawyer declined to comment at the time of publication.\n\nNow, more than a week later, Santos has admitted that the media outlets were mostly right, and he did indeed fudge his resume and much of his biography. Except he’s still being less than forthcoming, claiming in a WABC interview that “a lot of people overstate in their resumes, or twist a little bit.”\n\nFor example, he claimed he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, listing specific roles he held in these organizations. Now he says he simply liaised with both companies through his actual employment at the company Link Bridge, and that a simple “poor choice of words” gave a mistaken impression.\n\nThat poor choice of words? Santos’s campaign website said that he “began working at Citigroup as an associate and quickly advanced to become an associate asset manager in the real asset division of the firm” and “was then offered an exciting opportunity with Goldman Sachs but what he thought would be the pinnacle of his career was not as fulfilling as he had anticipated.”\n\nAs for claiming he attended Baruch College and New York University and received degrees in finance and economics, Santos told the New York Post that “I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume.” But he also seemed to shrug this lie off. “We do stupid things in life,” he said.\n\nSantos was similarly dismissive of reporting on his false claims of Jewish heritage. “I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos said to the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish, I claimed to be Jew-ish” is indeed quite the dodge.\n\nSantos had also claimed that he lost four employees in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. That wasn’t true, either, although he now says it was four prospective employees; still, he didn’t provide any names or other details.\n\nSantos even seems to have lied about his charity work. He claims to have founded the group Friends of Pets United, an animal rescue organization that was not registered as a charity in New York or New Jersey. According to New York Times reporting, the IRS has no record of it. The purported beneficiary of one $50-a-head fundraiser for Friends of Pets United says that she never received the money raised, according to the Times as well. Now, Santos is less clear about his work, saying he helped out the charity and found homes for the animals.\n\nOne claim that Santos flat-out denied was a finding from the Times that he was charged with fraud in Brazil after writing stolen checks. According to the New York Times, “In the court file, Mr. Santos is identified by his full name and date of birth, as well as by the names of his mother and father. The documents show that Mr. Santos confessed to the crime and was charged, but that the case remains unresolved because authorities were later unable to locate him.”\n\n“I am not a criminal here — not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,” Santos told the Post. “Absolutely not. That didn’t happen.”\n\nThe Santos saga is utterly fascinating, in the way stories of scammers and con men are often so captivating. What makes a person lie so often and so brazenly? What makes someone whose resume is largely false put themselves in the public eye and under a media microscope by running for office? How is it possible that when this person finally gets caught, they don’t slink away in shame, but rather lash out defiantly and simply refuse to face any consequences?\n\nThere is no doubt that Santos deceived voters in his district. The case he made for his candidacy was based, at least in part, on his experience and his resume. And he has proven himself wholly untrustworthy, which is particularly salient given many of the outstanding questions about his finances and net worth.\n\nSo why should the public trust anything further he says, given his egregious pattern of lying, dissembling and then downplaying his own lies? And how should the GOP respond?\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRepublican Party leaders could certainly pressure Santos not to take office. They could publicly denounce him, and say that their party stands for honesty and will not stand for brazenly lying to constituents. That may end with their party losing the seat in a special election, but that’s hardly a foregone conclusion; and at some point, principles have to trump power. If he insists on taking office anyway, they could launch an ethics investigation and/or withhold committee assignments from him.\n\nIt’s a sad reflection of today’s GOP, though, that I assume that they won’t do any of this. And so far, party leaders have largely stayed silent.

A “cash cow” isn’t really a “cash cow” if all you do with that cash is use it to feed the cow.

Read here.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has concluded that former President Donald Trump was ultimately responsible for the insurrection, laying out for the public and the Justice Department a trove of evidence for why he should be prosecuted for multiple crimes.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight-forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed,” the committee writes in a summary of its final report released on Monday. “None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.”\n\nThe summary describes in extensive detail how Trump tried to overpower, pressure and cajole anyone who wasn’t willing to help him overturn his election defeat – while knowing that many of his schemes were unlawful. His relentless arm-twisting included election administrators in key states, senior Justice Department leaders, state lawmakers, and others. The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump’s intent: that he “purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud” in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. “These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.”\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report summary:\n\nThe committee thinks Trump and others committed crimes, and is referring them to DOJ\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and John Eastman\n\nThe committee says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nIn addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nSeveral of the individuals named by the committee – including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani – had their own responses Monday.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the summary states.\n\nThe committee revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt also notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” the summary states, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say\n\nSources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nIn describing why the committee believes Trump’s conduct meet the prongs of each criminal statute, the summary stresses evidence that Trump had been warned that his schemes were unlawful.\n\nTrump raised about $250 million by crying fraud\n\nThe committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th. Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist.”\n\n“For example, the Trump Campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging claiming that the election was ‘rigged,’ that their donations could stop Democrats from ‘trying to steal the election,’ and that Vice President Biden would be an ‘illegitimate president’ if he took office,’” the summary states.\n\nSeveral members of Congress are being referred to the House Ethics Committee\n\nThe select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy speaks to reporters at the US Capitol in Washington in November. Michael A. McCoy/Reuters\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nConcerns about witness credibility and Trump-allied attorneys\n\nThe committee raised concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups were incentivized to protect the former president, saying, “lawyers who are receiving such payments have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients. The Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney have been provided with certain information related to this topic.”\n\nIn one instance, a witness whose lawyer was being paid by a Trump-allied group was told she could “in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” When the witness raised concerns with her lawyer about that approach, the lawyer said, “They don’t know what you know, [witness]. They don’t know that you can recall some of these things. So you saying ‘I don’t recall’ is an entirely acceptable response to this,” according to the report summary.\n\nWhen it came to a specific issue that reflected negatively on Trump, the lawyer told his client, “No, no, no, no, no. We don’t want to go there. We don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nThe committee notes both Trump and his allies attempted to contact witnesses ahead of their committee testimony.\n\n“The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses. The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,” according to the summary.\n\nIvanka Trump and Kayleigh McEnany\n\nThe committee also, in its final report, highlighted two high-profile witnesses – Ivanka Trump and then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany – as being less cooperative than others. They and others “displayed a lack of full recollection of certain issues, or were not otherwise as frank or direct as Cipollone.”\n\nA video of Ivanka Trump is shown on screen during the seventh hearing held by the committee on July 12. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn another instance, Trump had an angry conversation with Pence in which he referred to the then-vice president as “The P word,” according to a committee interview with Ivanka Trump’s chief of staff, Julie Radford.\n\nIn Radford’s recollection, the name-calling was upsetting to Ivanka at the time, but when the committee asked Ivanka whether there were any “particular words” her father used in the conversation with Pence, “She answered simply: ‘No.’”\n\nThe summary states: “In several circumstances, the Committee has found that less senior White House aides had significantly better recollection of events than senior staff purported to have.”\n\nAs for McEnany, the committee called her testimony “evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points,” noting she was deposed early in the investigation and wasn’t as forthcoming as others from Trump’s press office.\n\nImpropriety by Trump Justice Department officials\n\nThe report points the finger at two Trump appointees at the Justice Department who the committee believes abused their positions and acted unethically.\n\nClark, the former acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, is already well known for trying to weaponize the Justice Department to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The committee raises the prospect that Clark broke the law. The Justice Department is already investigating Clark and federal agents have searched his home.\n\nJeffrey Clark, speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington in September 2020. Susan Walsh/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most egregious things Clark did was draft a letter for the Justice Department to send to election officials in battleground states, urging them to essentially overturn their results. The letter, crafted with help from fellow Trump appointee Ken Klukowski, falsely asserted that the department believed there were problems with the results.\n\n“This was an intentional choice by Jeff Clark to contradict specific Department findings on election fraud, and purposely insert the Department into the Presidential election on President Trump’s behalf and risk creating or exacerbating a constitutional crisis,” the summary states.\n\nIn a new development, the panel flagged its concerns about Klukowski’s conduct.\n\nHe worked for the Trump campaign before joining the Justice Department during the final weeks of the administration. And while at the department’s civil division, he spent some of his time helping Clark with his attempts to overturn the election, “despite the fact that election-related matters are not part of the Civil portfolio,” the summary says.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns\n\nThe summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”\n\n“If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,” the summary says. “A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic.”\n\nThe summary revisits Trump’s infamous phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he begged Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to nullify Biden’s victory in the state. The summary also highlights that Trump doxed the leader of the Michigan Senate by tweeting out his cell phone number after he publicly said he wouldn’t undermine the election results.\n\nLawmakers also highlighted the plight of former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who previously testified about the abuse they suffered when Giuliani and others in pro-Trump circles falsely accused them of rigging the results in Atlanta.\n\nLike Freeman and Moss, other officials who faced Trump’s ire received death and rape threats and an avalanche of phone calls and emails, and some of them feared for their safety.\n\nPardon requests show that Trump allies knew they were in possible legal jeopardy\n\nThe evidence that Trump allies sought pardons as the administration drew to a close shows that they knew their conduct was legally problematic, the committee argues.\n\nThe summary points to previously public accounts of pardon requests from members of Congress, while providing new details of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged attempt for a pardon, which had been discussed in the public committee testimony of ex-White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nCNN previously reported that the McEntee testimony linked Gaetz’s pardon request to a separate DOJ probe; Hutchinson, however, said Gaetz and others asked “blanket” pardons for participants at a meeting where election-related schemes were discussed.\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement agencies knew of threats of violence on January 6, but information didn’t get through\n\nThe summary of the report lays out how the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies were receiving information that January 6 was likely to be violent and shared that information with the White House and US Secret Service.\n\nFor example, on January 3, 2021, Department of Justice officials received an intelligence summary of plans to “occupy the Capitol” and “invade” the Capitol on January 6. According to testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist predicted on a National Security Council call that the Capitol could be the target of violence.\n\n“I’ll never forget it,” Milley said in testimony revealed by the committee.\n\nThe panel suggests former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato failed to adequately serve as the intermediary between the intelligence community and the White House when it came to security updates ahead of January 6.\n\n“Ornato had access to intelligence that suggested violence at the Capitol on January 6th, and it was his job to inform Meadows and Trump of that. Although Ornato told us that he did not recall doing so, the Select Committee found multiple parts of Ornato’s testimony questionable,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe head of Trump’s security detail, Bobby Engel, testified to the committee that he shared critical information with Ornato as a means to convey messages to the White House.\n\nOrnato confirmed Engel’s understanding of information sharing, but when pressed on whether he talked to Meadows about concerns of the threat landscape going into January 6 said, “I don’t recall; however, in my position I would’ve made sure he was tracking the demos, which he received a daily brief, Presidential briefing. So he most likely was getting all this in his daily brief as well.”\n\nHope Hicks, former senior adviser to President Donald Trump, displayed on a screen during a hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022.

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAides urged Trump to call for peaceful protests\n\nStaffers close to Trump told the committee they tried to get the then-president to act preemptively to quell concerns about January 6.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director, texted spokesman Hogan Gidley as the violence was unfolding on January 6 that she had “suggested…several times” on January 4 and 5 that Trump should publicly state that January 6 remain peaceful. Hicks also testified that Herschmann advised Trump to make a preemptive public statement ahead of January 6 calling for there to be no violence that day. No such statement was ever made.\n\nBy the time of Trump’s rally on January 6, the committee says testimony it received indicates that the former president had received a security briefing and that the Secret Service mentioned that there were prohibited items being confiscated from individuals trying to attend.\n\nMotorcade incident proves Trump’s intent to participate in overturning the election\n\nThe committee highlights Trump’s frustration with not being taken to the Capitol on January 6 as evidence that he intended to participate in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The Committee’s principal concern was that the President actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House Chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,” the summary of the report reads. “There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.”\n\nThe report details that the panel was ultimately unable to get Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the committee about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nUltimately, the committee writes that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vows to release his transcript publicly. Ornato did not recall conveying the information to Hutchinson or a White House employee with national security responsibilities, according to the report.\n\n“The Committee is skeptical of Ornato’s account.”\n\nThe panel writes that it has obtained evidence from “several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.” The panel cites multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House who described Trump’s behavior as “irate,” “furious,” “insistent,” “profane” and “heated.”\n\nThe driver of Trump’s motorcade on January 6 testified to the committee:\n\nTrump’s former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after he returned to the White House.\n\n“So to the best of my recollection, I recall him being – wanting to saying that he wanted to physically walk and be a part of the march and then saying that he would ride the Beast if he needed to, ride in the Presidential limo,” McEnany said.\n\nAnother intent the committee’s report summary seeks to prove is that Trump’s call to his supporters to go the Capitol during his rally speech was pre-planned.\n\nFor example, the committee notes that January 6 rally organizer Kylie Kremer texted MyPIllow CEO Mike Lindell, “This stays only between us. … It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it ‘unexpectedly.’”\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nTrump did, however, take the time to reach out to his attorney.\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states..\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nGOP lawmakers called for help\n\nThe committee also highlights real-time reactions from Republican members of Congress who have since downplayed the Capitol attack or defended Trump.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner described House GOP leader McCarthy as “scared” as McCarthy reached out to members of Trump’s family for help during the riot.\n\nIn a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote, “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” according to the summary.\n\nFILE - Violent rioters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nTrump’s reaction upon finding out the Capitol had been attacked: ‘Oh really?’\n\nThe committee reveals a conversation Trump had with a White House employee upon returning to the White House after his speech on January 6. Trump’s actions and conversations from when he returned to the White House to when he called off the rioters, referred to famously as the 187 minutes, continues to have huge gaps of information.\n\nHe asked the White House employee – whose identity the panel kept anonymous “to guard against the risk of retaliation” – if they had watched his rally speech on television. The White House employee responded, “Sir, they cut it off because they’re rioting down at the Capitol.”\n\nWhen Trump asked what they meant, the employee repeated:\n\nThe summary acknowledges the roadblocks the House committee ran into in its investigation and says the Justice Department has the tools – such as grand jury subpoena power – to knock down those obstacles.\n\nThe summary also notes the invocations of privilege made by former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone that prevented the committee from learning details about direct conversations with Trump. But the panels appears optimistic that a recent, under-seal court victory the DOJ secured will allow prosecutors to obtain that testimony from Cipollone.\n\n“Based on the information it has obtained, the Committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol,” the summary says.\n\nMore than 30 witnesses before the select committee exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused, on that basis, to provide testimony. They included individuals central to the investigation, such as Eastman, Clark, Chesebro, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn and others.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Sara Murray Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer Marshall Cohen", "Tierney Sneed", "Sara Murray", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/january-6-committee-criminal-referrals/index.html", "title": "First on CNN: January 6 committee considers criminal referrals for at ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nThe panel is weighing criminal referrals for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, right wing lawyer John Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the sources said.\n\nThe committee has not officially decided whom to refer to the Justice Department for prosecution and for what offenses, sources said. The four individuals who are among those under consideration, and whose names have not been previously reported, provide a window into the panel’s deliberations.\n\nAnother source cautioned that while names are being considered, there is still discussion before names are finalized.\n\nWhile the criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature – as the DOJ has already undertaken a sprawling investigation into the US Capitol attack and efforts to overturn the 2020 election – committee members have stressed that the move serves as a way to document their views for the record.\n\nA spokesperson for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Thursday that committee members are expected to reach a decision on criminal referrals when members meet virtually on Sunday.\n\nThompson told reporters on Thursday how members evolved towards the idea of issuing criminal referrals as the panel’s investigation went on.\n\n“I think the more we looked at the body of evidence that we had collected, we just felt that while we’re not in the business of investigating people for criminal activities, we just couldn’t overlook some of them.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the January 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full committee, said Thursday, “I think anyone who engages in criminal actions needs to be held accountable for them. And we are going to spell that out.”\n\n“The gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order,” Raskin told reporters. “Subsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.”\n\nRaskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel’s vice chair GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprise the subcommittee.\n\nSchiff told CNN there is a “consensus among the members” regarding referrals and that members are taking a unified approach on that front.\n\nThompson told reporters earlier this week, “we will make referrals. As to how many, we’ve not decided that yet.” CNN previously reported that the committee is weighing Trump and a number of his closest allies for criminal referrals.\n\nThompson said the panel is aiming to release its final report and vote publicly on criminal referrals on December 21.\n\n“There will be some form of public presentation. We haven’t decided exactly what that would be,” Thompson said.\n\nMark Meadows\n\nThe committee subpoenaed Meadows for documents and testimony in September of last year, and he handed over more than 2,000 text messages he sent and received between Election Day 2020 and Joe Biden’s inauguration. The text messages, which were obtained by CNN, reveal how top Republican Party officials, right-wing figures and even Trump’s family members discussed with Meadows what Trump should say and do after the election and in the middle of the insurrection.\n\nMeadows did not turn over other documents he had, and the House committee voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress for it and for his refusal to testify, referring the matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department has declined to indict Meadows for evading his subpoena, given his high level position in the Trump West Wing and claims of executive privilege.\n\nRaskin also suggested Thursday that previous referrals to DOJ for contempt of Congress would not impact how the panel handles these criminal referrals.\n\n“We obviously did contempt of Congress referrals earlier and there’s a whole statutory process for making that happen,” he said. “But you know we will explain our decisions in detail – why we are making certain kinds of referrals for certain people and other kinds for others.”\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nEastman sat for an interview with the panel last year, but invoke his Fifth Amendment rights that protect against self-incrimination.\n\nIn the midst of a legal fight to obtain Eastman’s emails, a federal judge ruled in March that Eastman, along with Trump, may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election. The FBI seized Eastman’s phone in June as part of its criminal investigation according to a court filing from Eastman.\n\nDavid O. Carter, a federal judge in California, ordered Eastman to turn over 101 emails from the period around January 6, 2021, that he has tried to keep secret from the House select committee, which after a lengthy court battle, the panel ultimately received.\n\nCarter’s reasoning was a crucial acknowledgment by a federal court that Trump’s interest in overturning the election could be considered criminal.\n\n“The illegality of the plan was obvious,” Carter wrote.\n\nIn a hearing over the summer, the panel presented revelations that provided new insight into Eastman’s role as a central figure in the effort led by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Eastman was integral to the intense pressure campaign that Trump directed at then-Vice President Mike Pence to compel Pence to help carry out a plan to overturn the election results.\n\nIn the hearing, the committee walked through how Eastman put forward a legal theory that Pence could unilaterally block certification of the election – a theory that was roundly rejected by Trump’s White House attorneys and Pence’s team, but was nevertheless embraced by the former President.\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nClark invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 100 times during his deposition with the committee. Federal investigators have raided Clark’s home as part of their own criminal investigation.\n\nThe former DOJ official was facing a criminal contempt of Congress referral at the time after he refused to answer the committee’s questions at a prior deposition. The referral was never sent to DOJ because on the day the committee voted on the contempt referral, Clark’s lawyer informed the committee that he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions on the grounds it may incriminate him.\n\nThe panel dedicated much of a June hearing to Clark’s role in Trump’s attempts to weaponize the Justice Department in the final months of his term as part of the plot to overturn the 2020 election and stay in power.\n\nThe committee in particular zeroed in on the efforts of Rep. Scott Perry, the Pennsylvania Republican, who connected Clark to the White House in December 2020.\n\nCNN has previously reported on the role that Perry played, and the committee in court filings released text messages Perry exchanged with Meadows about Clark.\n\n“He wanted Mr. Clark – Mr. Jeff Clark to take over the Department of Justice,” Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Meadows aide, said about Perry in a clip of her deposition that was played at that hearing.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani, Trump’s onetime personal attorney and a lead architect of his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, met with the panel in May for more than nine hours.\n\nIn its initial subpoena, the committee alleges that Giuliani “actively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of the former President and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.” The subpoena also stated that Giuliani was in contact with Trump and members of Congress “regarding strategies for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Zachary Cohen Pamela Brown", "Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Pamela Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/14/joshua-trees-flirty-juror-free-vasectomies-news-around-states/50834573/", "title": "Joshua trees, flirty juror: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The federal government on Wednesday said the state of Alabama illegally discriminates against children in foster care with behavioral and emotional disabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/fact-check-republican-secretary-of-state-nominees-2020-election/index.html", "title": "At least 12 Republican nominees for state elections chief have ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nIn at least 12 states, the Republican nominee for the job of overseeing future elections is someone who has questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nSecretaries of state will play a critical role in managing and certifying the presidential election in 2024. The distinct possibility that some of these secretaries will be people with a history of election denial is a major challenge for American democracy – especially because former President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to run again in 2024, continues to pressure state officials to discard the will of voters.\n\nThe Republican nominees for secretary of state in the November 2022 midterm elections include three swing-state candidates who have made efforts to overturn 2020 results in their states: Mark Finchem of Arizona, Kristina Karamo of Michigan and Jim Marchant of Nevada.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Alabama, Wes Allen, expressed support for a 2020 lawsuit that sought to get the Supreme Court to toss out Joe Biden’s victory. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Indiana, Diego Morales, has called the 2020 election a “scam,” the vote “tainted” and the outcome “questionable.” The Republican nominee in GOP-dominated South Dakota, Monae Johnson, has refused to acknowledge that Biden won legitimately. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Wyoming, Chuck Gray, has said that Biden’s victory was “illegitimate” and that he “absolutely” thinks Trump was the real winner.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but regularly competitive Minnesota, Kim Crockett, has described the 2020 election in her state as “lawless.” The Republican nominee in the Democratic-dominated Connecticut, Dominic Rapini, is the former chair of a group that has made baseless complaints of 2020 fraud.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but sometimes competitive New Mexico, Audrey Trujillo, has called the 2020 election stolen. So have the Republican candidates in Massachusetts and Vermont, both obscure figures who face long odds of winning their liberal states in November.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the intensity with which these 12 nominees have committed to election rejection. For example, Morales acknowledged in June that Biden “legitimately occupies” the presidency, while Finchem, a serial promoter of wild conspiracy theories about the election, has persisted this year in his impossible quest to reverse Biden’s victory in Arizona.\n\nTwenty-seven states are holding secretary of state elections in 2022. CNN will update this list if we find information showing that the 2020 results have been disputed by additional Republican nominees.\n\nAlabama: Wes Allen\n\nRep. Wes Allen speaks during debate on transgender bills during the legislative session in the house chamber at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday April 7, 2022. Mickey Welsh/AP\n\nState representative Wes Allen, who won Alabama’s Republican nomination in a June runoff election, endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s victories in four states – tweeting in December 2020 that Alabama’s attorney general should “stand firm” in support.\n\nAllen has vowed to withdraw Alabama from a 31-state consortium that helps member states keep their voter rolls up to date, baselessly alleging that the consortium, which is funded and run by member states, is a “leftist” entity. Alabama’s departing Republican incumbent secretary of state, John Merrill, has called Allen’s claims “patently false” and defended the consortium as an important election security tool.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Pamela Laffitte, a corrections sergeant for a county sheriff’s office.\n\nAllen’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nArizona: Mark Finchem\n\nArizona state representative Mark Finchem (R-AZ) speaks at a rally in Iowa State Fairgrounds, in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., October 9, 2021. Rachel Mummey/Reuters\n\nMark Finchem is a far-right Arizona state representative who has for years promoted absurd conspiracy theories and other misinformation. Finchem has been aggressively dishonest about the 2020 election – and he continues to push to “decertify” Biden’s 2020 win in Arizona, though this cannot be done.\n\nFinchem has repeatedly and falsely claimed that “Trump won” the election. He has falsely proclaimed that “the election was a fraud” and that it was “rigged.” He demanded in mid-2021 that liberal officials and the media prove the falsity of election conspiracy theories that had already been proven false, even selling shirts reading “#ProveIt.”\n\nFinchem, who was endorsed by Trump last year and won the Republican primary earlier this month, played a key early role in the election-denying “Stop the Steal” movement in Arizona. After he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, he was photographed outside the US Capitol during the insurrection that day. He also tweeted a sympathetic message about the rioters, blaming Congress for refusing to acknowledge the “rampant fraud” that, again, didn’t exist. (Finchem denies any involvement in the riot and has not been charged with anything.)\n\nOn the first anniversary of the insurrection, Finchem tweeted a false claim that “the real insurrection” was how Democratic officials in Arizona had rigged the election with “tens of thousands of fraudulent votes” in two big counties won by Biden. This is just fiction.\n\nIn July, Finchem baselessly called for the arrest of incumbent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now the Democratic nominee for governor, and Adrian Fontes, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state who oversaw the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where many Republicans have baselessly alleged mass fraud.\n\nFinchem’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nConnecticut: Dominic Rapini\n\nDominic Rapini is a candidate for secretary of state for Connecticut. From Dominic Rapini/Facebook\n\nDominic Rapini, who won Connecticut’s Republican primary on Tuesday, formerly served as board chair for a group called Fight Voter Fraud, Inc., which has had its baseless allegations about the 2020 election proven inaccurate by Connecticut’s elections enforcement commission. The Connecticut Post reported that the commission admonished Fight Voter Fraud in 2021; the commission said the group had wasted the commission’s limited resources and should “educate themselves” on the facts and the law before filing complaints.\n\nWhile chairing Fight Voter Fraud, Rapini at least indirectly promoted false claims that there was massive fraud in the 2020 election. He was listed as the author of a web post linking to a document that recommended various reports that falsely alleged the election had been stolen, falsely claimed that statistics cast doubt on Biden’s win, or falsely suggested something was amiss in 2020 with voting machines. (Rapini has said he left his role at Fight Voter Fraud, Inc. in August 2021.)\n\nRapini, who says he has spent more than two decades in sales at Apple, said in an appearance on Hartford station FOX61 in July that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president of the United States.” But in various other interviews over the past year, he refused to offer a direct answer when asked if he believed Biden’s victory was legitimate or whether Trump was the real winner. Dodging the question, he told The Connecticut Examiner in 2021: “I haven’t been researching what’s happened in Arizona and Wisconsin, I haven’t studied it. I will say that Joe Biden was certified in January and we have to move on.”\n\nHe told CT Insider this May: “Listen, Joe Biden, God bless him, was the duly elected president of the United States and beyond that, there’s so many details there I can’t really dive into them, I don’t know the particulars … I think there was definitely anomalies, and there’s things we need to understand, but I have no reason to believe there was widescale fraud in Connecticut, there’s nothing there that I can prove.”\n\nAsked for comment, Rapini said in an email: “I have stated on many occasions during my campaign that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United States.” CNN then sent him three examples of how he had sometimes avoided questions about the legitimacy of Biden’s victory and asked him to directly answer that question; we explained we were unclear if he was making some distinction between “duly” and “legitimately” elected. Rapini responded indirectly once more – saying he has been “very clear” in TV interviews that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president” and that reporters with “predisposed assumptions” sometimes leave out parts of his comments.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is state Rep. Stephanie Thomas.\n\nIndiana: Diego Morales\n\nDiego Morales, the GOP pick for Indiana's Secretary of State, does a press conference at the state GOP Convention, Indiana Farmer's Coliseum, Indianapolis, Saturday, June 18, 2022. Robert Scheer/IndyStar/USA Today Network\n\nIn March, when Diego Morales was running for the Republican nomination in Indiana, he published an article on the website Hoosier State Today in which he sharply disputed the legitimacy of the 2020 election – proclaiming that “we have valid reasons to doubt the official vote tallies in key states,” that the vote was “tainted,” that “the outcome is questionable,” and that the election was a “scam.”\n\nMorales, who served as an aide to Mike Pence when Pence was governor of Indiana, went on to argue that late changes to states’ election policies were illegitimate and – vaguely – that it was unconstitutional to subject mail-in voters and the Election Day voters to different levels of “scrutiny.”\n\nSome of Morales’ specific claims are subjective. Nonetheless, his broad initial claim that there are valid reasons to doubt key states’ vote totals is plain false.\n\nMorales has sometimes taken a softer line. After beating Republican incumbent Secretary of State Holli Sullivan for the party nomination at a party convention in June, he told Fox59 of Indianapolis that he had “already moved on” from 2020 to focus on future elections. Morales told journalist Brian Howey in June that Biden was elected in 2020 and “legitimately occupies that office today,” though he also maintained that “there were a number of irregularities in that election.”\n\nMorales campaign manager Kegan Prentice touted Morales’ biography in a statement to CNN and said, “His sole focus now is on visiting all 92 counties in Indiana to listen to and learn from voters so he can best serve them.”\n\nMorales was terminated from a job in the Indiana secretary of state’s office in 2009 for allegedly poor work performance, the Indianapolis Star reported in June. Morales faced more criticism of his work performance after returning to the office under a different secretary of state, the Star reported, and resigned in 2011 after refusing to sign on to an improvement plan.\n\nThe Star reported that Morales said: “Anybody can you write you up at any time, because their envy, selfish office rivalry, whatever you may want to call it. That’s exactly what happened.” Morales’ campaign manager also provided CNN with positive comments about him from Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who was secretary of state in 2009. Rokita wrote, “As far as I’m concerned, Diego left my office on good terms, and I consider him a long time friend.”\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Destiny Wells, an officer in the Army Reserve and a lawyer who was formerly a deputy state attorney general.\n\nMassachusetts: Rayla Campbell\n\nRayla Campbell, candidate for secretary of state in Massachusetts. From Rayla Campbell for Massachusetts/Facebook\n\nRayla Campbell, a radio host who is running unopposed in the Republican primary in Massachusetts, falsely declared in November 2020 – after media outlets had called the election for Biden – that Trump was the actual winner.\n\n“Our great president is the President elected for the next four years. We know it. They’re trying to steal an election because they can’t win or do anything right,” Campbell said on a November 2020 radio show during which she also promoted so-called “stop the steal” events.\n\nOn another November 2020 radio show, Campbell endorsed false conspiracy theories about election software and wrongly declared that “there’s no way, with all of the Trump rallies and the support that we had out there, that our candidates didn’t get more votes.” She also called for Republicans to adopt “dirty” tactics to combat the cheating she inaccurately claimed Democrats had done.\n\n“They did it again with the cheating of the counting of the ballots,” she said. “And they will always do stuff like that because they can’t win legally, and that’s why we’ve got to fight a lot harder. A lot harder, and a little dirty. Because they fight extremely dirty. It’s time to beat ‘em at their own game, and we can do that.”\n\nIn December 2020, after the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s victory, Campbell continued to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the outcome. And she repeated her false claim about a “stolen” election in a combative speech at the state Republican convention in May 2022.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in late July, Campbell did not back down from any of her previous claims. She called for audits of the 2020 election in all 50 states, and she repeatedly criticized the news media for supposed bias. She added, though, that she has “moved on from 2020 elections because we’re going into 2022.”\n\nDemocratic incumbent William Galvin and Democrat Tanisha Sullivan, a lawyer who is president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, are also running.\n\nMichigan: Kristina Karamo\n\nKristina Karamo, who is running for the Michigan Republican party's nomination for secretary of state, speaks at a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump on April 02, 2022 near Washington, Michigan. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nKristina Karamo, who was endorsed by Trump last year and Michigan’s Republican Party at its convention this year, falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan” – where Joe Biden actually beat Trump by more than 154,000 votes.\n\nKaramo, who has taught orientation and public speaking courses at a community college, rose to prominence in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when she claimed to have witnessed fraud while working as a Republican poll challenger monitoring the processing of absentee ballots in Detroit. (The Detroit Free Press found that her claims were based on misinterpretations of standard election processes; a Republican-led state Senate investigation into Michigan’s election found “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud.”) She subsequently filed an affidavit as part of a lawsuit that attempted to get the Supreme Court to discard Biden’s victories in Michigan and three other states.\n\nKaramo also promoted false claims about Dominion elections technology even after these claims had been thoroughly debunked, baselessly declaring in December 2020 that there were “over 200,000 votes” in Michigan that were “potentially compromised” by Dominion software. After winning the backing of the state party this April, Karamo said she was not going to say “whether or not I think the election was stolen,” Sinclair Broadcast Group reported, but she went on to complain of “so many illegal things that occurred.”\n\nKaramo has to be chosen once more at a Republican convention later in August to become the official party nominee, but that is widely expected to happen after her dominant performance at the April endorsement convention. The Democratic candidate is incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\nKaramo’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinnesota: Kim Crockett\n\nKim Crockett speaks during the first day of the Minnesota State Republican Convention, May 13, 2022, at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minn. Glen Stubbe/AP\n\nKim Crockett has said of the 2020 election in Minnesota: “I don’t think the word ‘lawless’ is too strong.” When an interviewer told her that he believes Minnesota’s election was “illegitimate,” she said she agreed.\n\nCrockett, a lawyer who won Minnesota’s Republican primary on Tuesday, has been particularly focused on state Democrats’ changes to election rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. But she has also promoted a right-wing film that makes dubious claims about supposed 2020 cheating. She baselessly called absentee voting “frankly insecure.” And she questioned whether mail workers – who carry millions of ballots every federal election with very few problems – can be trusted to carry ballots given that “the postal union is a partisan player” in politics.\n\n“Makes you kind of go: ‘Huh.’ After 2020, you start looking at everything,” Crockett said in a June interview.\n\nAt a state Republican convention in May, Crockett’s campaign played a video that depicted liberal billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, as a puppetmaster pulling the strings of incumbent Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and prominent Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, who are also Jewish. The chairman of the state party issued an apology – but also claimed Crockett had been unaware the video included antisemitic tropes.\n\nCrockett has previously worked or volunteered for conservative organizations, including a voter organization that has described the 2020 election as “rigged” and a think tank that suspended her in 2019 for comments about Somali immigrants for which she soon apologized. (However, she said this year that she was “taken out of context” by The New York Times and “would say everything today that I said in 2019.”)\n\nIn late July, CNN sent the Crockett campaign an email offering a chance to comment for this article. The email outlined many of the facts the article planned to mention and explained that Crockett would be included on a list of nominees who had denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nIn response, Crockett called and left a message saying she found the request “less than open to actually finding out more about me or my campaign” and that we should look into “who I really am as opposed to who other people have said I am.” She also said, however, that she only had time to send along written comments she had previously provided to another journalist.\n\nIn those previous comments, Crockett outlined her criticism of Simon’s policy decisions, recommended a right-wing commentator’s book about how the 2020 election was “rigged” and wrote: “The corporate media narrative is that 2020 was the most secure election in the history of voting. This is propaganda designed to stop the conversation. And they viciously attack anyone who dares to question that conclusion, calling us names like ‘election deniers’ instead of engaging us on election policy.”\n\nNevada: Jim Marchant\n\nJim Marchant, center, the GOP nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, speaks with people at a political event July 16, 2022, in Pahrump, Nev. John Locher/AP\n\nJim Marchant, a businessman and former Nevada state assemblyman, has promoted baseless conspiracy theories about not only the 2020 election but numerous past elections. Marchant has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Nevadans haven’t actually elected “anybody” for years – either “for decades” or particularly since 2006, when Republican future senator Dean Heller was serving as secretary of state.\n\n“And in Nevada and maybe other places all over the country – we haven’t in Nevada elected anybody since 2006. They have been installed by the deep state cabal,” Marchant falsely said in podcast comments that were reported in January by liberal organization Media Matters for America.\n\nMarchant has said he would not have certified Biden’s 33,596-vote victory in Nevada if he had been secretary of state in 2020, falsely claiming to NBC News that it is “almost statistically impossible that Joe Biden won.” Marchant attended the December 2020 event where other Nevada Republicans signed on to be phony Trump electors. And Marchant told The Guardian early this year that it was “very possible” he would be prepared to submit alternate electors in 2024.\n\nMarchant unsuccessfully tried to get a court to order a re-vote of his unsuccessful 2020 congressional race, which he lost by more than 16,000 votes. He has been so consistent in questioning Nevada’s elections system, which his campaign has wrongly described as “fraudulent,” that he even raised doubts about his own victory in the Republican secretary of state primary this June – telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was “not really confident in the result” and that there “could have been anomalies.”\n\nMarchant’s Democratic opponent is Cisco Aguilar, a lawyer who was formerly a staffer for late US Senator Harry Reid. They are vying to replace term-limited Republican incumbent Barbara Cegavske.\n\nMarchant’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico: Audrey Trujillo\n\nAudrey Trujillo, candidate for secretary of state in New Mexico. From Audrey Trujillo/Facebook\n\nAudrey Trujillo, a conservative activist whose campaign biography says she has operated a daycare, falsely claimed in a Facebook interview in March that the 2020 election was “a huge, huge, I would say coup, to really unseat a president.” On her own Facebook page, she falsely wrote in June that “Trump’s election was stolen.”\n\nTrujillo, who ran unopposed in New Mexico’s Republican primary, falsely claimed in the March interview that votes were fraudulently switched from Republicans to Democrats in 2020 races at “all levels,” including a New Mexico US Senate race that was, in reality, won handily and fairly by a Democrat. She also falsely claimed in the interview that the US is “no better than any other communist country like Venezuela or any of these other states where our elections are being manipulated.”\n\nWhen CNN asked Trujillo’s campaign in late July for comment on these claims, it responded by asking where we had gotten them from. When we provided links to the claims, the campaign did not respond again.\n\nTrujillo’s Democratic opponent is incumbent Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.\n\nSouth Dakota: Monae Johnson\n\nMonae Johnson, the Republican candidate for South Dakota secretary of state. Monae Johnson for Secretary of State\n\nMonae Johnson, a former employee of the South Dakota secretary of state’s office, repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview with KELOLAND News to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. “I don’t want to be an election denier, but I wasn’t behind the scenes, I wasn’t in the office at the time, so,” she said. The reporter said, “Okay. I wanted to give you an opportunity to acknowledge that, if you’d like – that he did win. Do you acknowledge that?” Johnson responded, “I’m not going to acknowledge that, so, thank you.”\n\nJohnson also said “I’ve never denied any election,” and she added, “I know President Trump won South Dakota as a Republican state. Joe Biden won the swing states; he’s our current president. But I want to move on to the next elections, and I want to inspire people that their vote is going to be tabulated exactly like they vote, ‘cause that’s going to just bring the trust to the citizens of South Dakota.”\n\nRunning on an “election integrity” platform, Johnson defeated incumbent South Dakota Secretary of State Steve Barnett at a state Republican convention in June. Her Democratic opponent is Tom Cool, the former executive director of the Council on College Admission in South Dakota.\n\nJohnson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVermont: H. Brooke Paige\n\nH. Brooke Paige stands in front of the Vermont Statehouse on Thursday, Aug. 16, 2018, in Montpelier, Vt. Lisa Rathke/AP/File\n\nH. Brooke Paige, a conservative activist in Vermont, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for secretary of state while also running unopposed for the party nominations for state attorney general, auditor and treasurer. He plans to turn down the latter three nominations and focus on his secretary of state campaign, the Vermont website VTDigger reported.\n\nThe day after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in 2021, Paige falsely claimed on his Facebook page that the left “stole” the election through a “subversive plan” involving “stuffing the ballot box and corrupting the tabulation of the election results.” He made other false election claims in subsequent posts.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in August, Paige acknowledged that Biden was the real winner in Vermont in 2020, but said the question of whether Biden legitimately won the presidency is “such a complex question,” hinging on how someone defines “legitimately,” that he could not offer a direct answer.\n\nPaige criticized state-level changes to voting rules in 2020, said he was disheartened by “anecdotal evidence” of suspicious behavior during the vote count – there is no indication of wrongdoing by any state’s vote-counters – and said his “biggest concern” was pro-Democratic media bias, which he argued had been a major contributor to Biden’s victory.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Jim Condos is retiring. The Democratic nominee is state Rep. Sarah Copeland Hanzas.\n\nWyoming: Chuck Gray\n\nWyoming state representative Chuck Gray in Augugust 2021. (Hannah Gaber-USA TODAY) Hannah Gaber/USA Today\n\nIn 2021, Wyoming state Rep. Chuck Gray falsely called Biden’s election “illegitimate,” falsely described the 2020 election as “the fraudulent election,” and told CNN that he “absolutely” believed that Trump won.\n\nIn December 2020, Gray urged Wyoming leaders to join the Texas-led lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden’s victories in four states. When Republican Gov. Mark Gordon decided against doing so, Gray wrote on Facebook that Gordon was “totally wrong.”\n\nGray won the Republican nomination for secretary of state in August 2022.

But human rights groups say that thousands of innocent people have been wrongly imprisoned, and have raised concerns over torture, forced disappearances and Bukele’s increasingly authoritarian grip on power.\n\nWhat is the background?\n\nThe crackdown was “prompted by a bloody killing spree by gangs” in March last year, said CNN, in which 92 people died. On 27 March, there were 62 murders in a single day, “the deadliest day on record since the country’s civil war ended”, said The New York Times. The notorious Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang was blamed.\n\nBukele asked the Legislative Assembly (in which his party, Nuevas Ideas, has held a two-thirds majority since 2021), to declare a 30-day state of emergency. This suspended various constitutional rights, even allowing prosecutors to jail children aged 12 and above. It has been repeatedly extended ever since.\n\nAccording to a joint report by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organisation and Cristosal (a Salvadoran rights group) in December, the state of emergency has allowed widespread human-rights violations, including torture, forced disappearances and deaths in custody, the circumstances of which “suggest state responsibility”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe campaign of “mass, indiscriminate arrests” has led to the detention of hundreds of people “with no apparent connections to gangs’ abusive activity”, said HRW, often for long periods of time in harsh conditions and without trial.\n\nBukele “glories in brutality”, said The Economist, “tweeting photos of suspects cuffed, half-naked and packed tighter than battery hens”.\n\nLast month, justice minister Gustavo Villatoro said he would allow up to 900 people to be prosecuted at the same time. These “Kafkaesque trials”, said El Pais, “would undermine access to justice for victims of gang violence, hinder the release of innocent people, and violate due process guarantees”.\n\nHas it worked?\n\nEl Salvador’s homicide rate has fallen from a peak of 106 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015, to 7.8 in 2022, said The Wall Street Journal – “well below some major US cities”. Going by homicide data, said Unherd, there is now “good reason” to believe Bukele’s claims that El Salvador is in fact the “safest country in Latin America”.\n\nWhile analysts dispute how much can be credited to Bukele, “he can surely claim some”, said The Economist. But “his scrapping of due process carries costs that will outweigh these benefits”.\n\nBukele’s crackdown has pushed the country down the Freedom in the World index from “free” to “partly free”, with the report citing corruption that undermines democracy and the rule of law.\n\nThe peace may not hold: in the past, gangs have “benefited from policies of mass incarceration by using prisons to recruit new members”, said Human Rights Watch, and strengthening bonds behind bars.\n\n“When massive rights violations become commonplace, it’s very rare for this to result in lasting peace,” Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nBukele is “highly undemocratic, highly abusive – and highly popular”, wrote Juan Pappier, acting Americas deputy director for Human Rights Watch, for El País.\n\nAbout 93% of Salvadorans endorse his presidency, according to a recent report: one of the highest rates in the world. In June, a poll by Salvadoran think tank Fundaungo reported that 53% of respondents had a positive view of the state of emergency. Only 9% had a negative view. About 40% of respondents said that crime reduction was the greatest achievement of Bukele’s tenure.\n\nThe crackdown has bolstered Bukele’s bid for re-election in 2024, despite a long-standing interpretation of the Constitution that forbids leaders serving a second continuous term. “The way the rules [of the Constitution] were redefined has raised fears Bukele could cling on beyond one more term,” said the FT.\n\nLatin American politicians are praising Bukele. In Peru, “there is talk of building a monument in his honour”, said the Los Angeles Times. In Honduras and Ecuador, “leaders have copied his draconian security policies”, while in Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia and Guatemala, “citizens have taken to the streets calling on their own governments to embrace his extreme strategies”.\n\nThe “brash young autocrat has won legions of fans” throughout the continent, and the criticism by human rights advocates “seems to only feed his cult-like status as a renegade willing to get things done, whatever the cost”.\n\nBukele’s security model “threatens democratic institutions in the region”, said El Pais. “His methods are ripe for copying anywhere with high crime and weak institutions,” said The Economist, and could “tip such places into autocracy”.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Rebekah Evans", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/962329/protests-in-syria-could-they-bring-down-the-assad-regime", "title": "Protests in Syria: could they bring down the Assad regime? | The Week", "text": "Twelve years after the Arab Spring uprising in Syria morphed into bloody civil war, a new wave of protests against President Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime is gathering momentum, said Raja Abdulrahim in The New York Times.\n\nThe unrest began in August in the southern province of Sweida, home to Syria’s Druze sect: it was triggered by the government slashing subsidies for fuel, at a stroke doubling its price.\n\nProtesters tore down “the ubiquitous posters” of Assad and attacked the shuttered offices of his ruling Ba’ath Party.

Unlike past protest movements, this one “transcends sectarian boundaries”: groups that largely stayed neutral in the civil war – Christians, tribal Muslims and above all, the Druze – are all clamouring for regime change. Aside from refusing to send their young men on mandatory military service in Assad’s army, the Druze leaders have hitherto tried to keep things calm with Damascus. Now they’re openly criticising the regime.\n\nWith good reason, said Robin Yassin-Kassab on his blog Qunfuz. The economy has buckled: soaring unemployment and hyperinflation are making life unbearable: 90% of Syrians now live below the poverty line. And they’re well aware that this is the fault not of Western sanctions, but of the “looting of the country” by Assad, Russia and Iran.\n\nThe botched response to the devastating earthquake that struck Syria and Turkey in February has also served to fuel popular anger, said Marwan Kabalan in Al-Araby Al-Jadeed (London). The regime now has little choice but to pay heed to the demands for change.\n\nProtests won’t trigger revolution\n\nLet’s be realistic, said Radwan Ziadeh on Syria.tv (Istanbul). Yes, these protests may intensify; but they won’t trigger a revolution. Assad has “systematically eliminated” political rivals and can crush dissent with his security forces.\n\nBut his problem is that he’s always claimed that Syria’s minorities are loyal to the regime, said Amberin Zaman on Al-Monitor (Washington). If he unleashes his forces on the Druze and other minorities, that key narrative of his regime will crumble.\n\nThe irony is that he’s losing the loyalty of previously acquiescent minorities at the very time he’s winning back friends abroad. In May, Syria was even welcomed back into the Arab League after a 12-year absence. If he now resorts to violent repression of (mainly) Muslim minorities, he’s likely to find himself out in the cold once more.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Hollie Clemence", "Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/955524/how-war-ukraine-started-and-how-will-end", "title": "How might the Ukraine war end? | The Week", "text": "Donald Trump has pledged to end Russia's war in Ukraine within days of taking office. Here's how it might be done.\n\nWhat has Trump promised?\n\nTo end the war immediately. \"I'll have that done in 24 hours,\" he said last year. The US has spent more than $120bn in aid to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022, making it by some distance the largest donor. However, domestic support for arming Ukraine appears to have waned, particularly among Republicans, and isolationism is prevalent in the Maga movement. \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,\" said Trump's VP-elect J.D. Vance in 2022; this year he said that he was \"opposed to virtually any proposal for the United States to continue funding this war\". After the election, Donald Trump Jr reposted a meme warning President Zelenskyy: \"You're 38 days from losing your allowance.\" Trump's own position, though, has been fluid. He has presented no plan, and has not said how he would bridge the gap between apparently irreconcilable Russian and Ukrainian positions.\n\nWhat is the Russian position?\n\nIn June, Vladimir Putin outlined his negotiating stance. To end the war, Ukraine must withdraw forces from four Ukrainian provinces that Russia has invaded and claims as its own territory: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. (Currently, Russia occupies about 70% of these, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014 – in total, about 20% of Ukraine's land.) In addition, Ukraine must give up its plans to join Nato; reduce the size of its military; and \"denazify\" its leadership (presumably code for removing the likes of Zelensky). Finally, all international sanctions on Russia must be lifted. However, Russia, though dominant at this stage in the war, is suffering massive casualties and its economy seems precarious. Putin has said he will talk to Trump. Russian officials have said they would consider freezing the conflict on its current lines, with \"room for negotiation over the precise carve-up\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine should be given clear security guarantees, in the form of Nato membership or similar. In addition, Russian war crimes against Ukraine should be prosecuted; compensation paid out; and abducted Ukrainian children returned. However, since the failure of last year's southern offensive, it has become clear that, as Zelensky put it last week, \"our army lacks the strength\" to expel the Russians. \"We do have to find diplomatic solutions,\" he said.\n\nHow might Trump reach a deal?\n\nTrump is reported to be far from settled on a single approach. But he has appointed Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general, as his envoy to Ukraine and Russia; and Kellogg published a paper in April outlining his plan. His proposal is that the US would continue to supply weapons to the Ukrainians, but only on the condition that they join peace talks. At the same time, Trump would warn Russia that if it rejected negotiations, US aid to Ukraine would be increased. The front lines would be frozen. Ukraine would not be asked to formally cede territory; but it would agree to try to recover it only through diplomatic means. Ukraine's Nato application would also be frozen. The US and its allies would only lift sanctions and normalise ties with Russia if it signs a deal \"acceptable to Ukraine\".\n\nCould it work?\n\nMany Kremlin-watchers doubt that Putin has any desire to negotiate or freeze the conflict. One well-connected oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, said that if Kellogg came to Russia with his plan, \"We would tell him to go to hell\". Even if the Kremlin does engage, the fear is that the US has far more leverage over Ukraine than over Russia, because stopping military aid would be disastrous for the Ukrainians. So Trump might only be able to push for a peace unfavourable to Ukraine. However, Kurt Volker, his former Ukraine envoy, hopes that Trump will take a hard line: that if Putin refuses to end the war, Trump will let Ukraine borrow as much money and buy as many weapons as it needs. Kyiv, too, is being asked to make painful compromises: giving up not just land but also citizens to Russia's illegal occupation. And a deal might only give Russia time to regroup before it attacks again. So Ukraine wants cast-iron security guarantees.\n\nHow could Ukraine's security be guaranteed?\n\nUkraine is demanding to be brought into Nato. But neither Trump nor other Nato nations want this; and Putin would do everything in his power to block it. One other possibility is for a demilitarised zone, preserved by peacekeeping troops. It has been reported that Trump would call on EU and British troops to enforce a buffer zone between the Russian and Ukrainian armies. This would be expensive and possibly dangerous for those nations, and Russia might well be implacably opposed. Alternatively, some have proposed the \"Israel model\": Ukraine remains formally outside Nato but is plentifully supplied with weapons and diplomatic support by the US and the West.\n\nIs peace possible?\n\nThis depends on a series of complex interlocking issues: essentially, the tolerance of both sides for continued fighting, and the extent of Western support. The two did come close to reaching a deal before, in Istanbul, weeks after the war began. It was proposed then that Ukraine would give up its Nato ambitions and commit to neutrality, but would have security guarantees from Western nations. The talks fell apart, for reasons that are disputed, with key issues still undecided. Negotiations under Trump's auspices would be \"a trip to the casino\" for Ukraine, one member of its security forces told The Guardian. \"But by now everyone is exhausted, and some people are willing to make risky bets.\"\n\nWho will lose first?\n\nUkraine's weaknesses are clear: it is outmanned and outgunned, and facing a renewed onslaught on its eastern front despite the massive losses it has inflicted on the invading Russians. Its energy grid is pulverised daily. President Zelensky is unwilling to mobilise more troops by lowering the age for military service from 25 to 18, though the US urged him to do so last month.\n\nBut the pressures on Russia are considerable, too. Casualty figures are hard to verify, but Ukraine estimates that 198,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and 550,000 more wounded (compared to 43,000 Ukrainian dead and 370,000 wounded). Although there is practically no internal opposition to Putin, the war is not popular: independent polling suggests 49% of Russians support withdrawing troops even if it means not achieving stated military goals. Perhaps the most pressing issue, though, is the economy. The official inflation rate has reached 8.5%, even though the central bank has raised its main interest rate to 21%. Prices of staples are going up by more than 20% per year. The government is expected to raise rates again this month, and is spending its savings. \"None of this is about to bring the economy to its knees,\" said The Economist, \"but neither is it sustainable indefinitely.\"", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Elliott Goat", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954310/what-does-reform-uk-stand-for", "title": "What does Reform UK stand for? | The Week", "text": "Large donations from a number of wealthy billionaires including Elon Musk will help Reform UK deliver \"political disruption like we have never seen before\", the party's new treasurer has said.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, property developer Nick Candy set out the goal for Reform: overtaking the Conservatives as the UK's main party of the right, while also drawing voters away from Labour.\n\nMany in Westminster fear a financial intervention from Musk, the world's richest person who reportedly plans to give as much as $100 million (£80 million) to the party, \"could have a significant and lasting impact on British politics, giving Reform the resources to transform itself into an established vehicle for power\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The UK's first-past-the-post electoral system meant this only translated into five MPs, but crucially it came second in 98 seats, 89 of which were won by Labour.\n\nWhat are Reform's policies?\n\nReform UK has a populist agenda aimed at attracting voters from both the left and right who are frustrated with the two main parties and feel strongly about issues such as immigration and the costs of net zero.\n\nIn a column published in The Telegraph to announce the party's relaunch in 2020, Farage and former party leader Richard Tice vowed to take on \"powerful vested interests\", including \"badly run, wasteful quangos\", the BBC, the House of Lords and the Home Office.\n\nReform's manifesto for last summer's UK general election was described by Farage as \"radical\" and \"outside the box\" and put a hardline stance on immigration unsurprisingly front and centre.\n\nReform's plan to \"stop the boats\" carrying migrants crossing the Channel completely is part of a four-point plan to curb illegal immigration. It would freeze all \"non-essential\" legal migration and take the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights so it can use offshore processing centres for illegal immigrants and prevent them from claiming asylum.\n\nShrinking the size of the state and reducing the tax burden is another key pledge Reform hopes will win over disillusioned voters. A planned £50 billion a year reduction in government spending would help fund its manifesto pledges to raise the income tax threshold from £12,571 to £20,000, exempting six million people from having to pay income tax. The party would also scrap VAT on energy bills, lift the VAT threshold on businesses to £150,000, cut fuel duty and corporation tax, and raise the inheritance tax threshold to £2 million.\n\nOn energy, the party proposes scrapping the UK's 2050 net zero targets and green levies to bring down energy bills, while fast-tracking North Sea oil and gas licences, and doing more to enable fracking.\n\nCulture war issues also featured prominently in Reform's offer to Red Wall voters. Farage placed \"issues and arguments around gender on the very first page\" of his party's election manifesto, said The Guardian, condemning the \"divisive 'woke' ideology\" he claimed had captured public institutions. The party has vowed to ban the teaching of \"transgender ideology\" in schools and scrap diversity, equality and inclusion rules.\n\nReform's manifesto promised a referendum on the current voting system and in what Politico said is \"another pledge that brings Farage's party in line with many of the left\", it also called for the unelected House of Lords to be replaced with a \"much smaller, more democratic second chamber\".\n\nWhat is Reform's strategy to win power?\n\nSince assuming the leadership of Reform in the summer, Farage has made no secret of his plan to usurp the Conservatives as the main opposition party to Labour with the \"real ambition\" to win power at the next general election in 2029.\n\nReform claims to be \"Britain's fastest growing political party\" and has released a \"live membership tracker\" that shows how it is close to overtaking the Conservative party's 131,680 card-carrying members.\n\nThe party is now just a few points behind Labour and the Conservatives nationally, according to Sky News polling, \"but with a general election still four years away, its challenge is holding on to that momentum\".\n\nIt is just the latest boost in what has been a \"pretty good year\" for Reform in general and Farage in particular, said The Spectator.\n\n\"At the beginning of 2024, he was out of politics and fresh out of the jungle, having returned from 'I'm A Celeb…' with no imminent plans of a comeback. Now, fast forward 12 months, he is an MP, party leader and beating Keir Starmer as a more popular choice of PM.\"\n\nReform has \"been buoyed in recent weeks by a series of high-profile Tory defections\" and \"hopes to win hundreds of council seats at local elections in May, and at least one mayoralty\", said the FT.\n\nWith longstanding ally Donald Trump soon to be back in the White House and Musk potentially backing them to the tune of tens of millions of pounds, Farage's 2029 electoral ambitions are starting to seem not so far-fetched.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Irenie Forshaw", "Richard Windsor", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/history/959938/the-holodomor-ukraines-other-significant-anniversary", "title": "The Holodomor: Ukraine's other significant anniversary | The Week", "text": "While the World marked the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week, this year also marks the 90th anniversary of another Ukrainian tragedy, the Holodomor genocide.\n\nA famine that killed nearly four million people, stripped Ukraine of it's independence, and still was denied by the Soviet Union.\n\nWhy is this still so significant?\n\nA man-made famine ravaged the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1932 to 1933, killing several million people. While it was officially denied by the Kremlin for more than 50 years, it “dramatically changed Ukrainian society and culture, leaving deep scars in the national memory”, writes Serhii Plokhy, the eminent Ukrainian historian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine officially declared the famine a genocide in 2006, and has lobbied the international community to do the same. Twenty-four countries have done so, including, in recent months, Germany, Ireland, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nHow did the famine come about?\n\nIn 1928, Joseph Stalin decided that the USSR’s survival depended on rapid industrialisation. His first Five-Year Plan decreed that private landholdings should be merged into collective farms, run on communist lines; increased production would feed factory workers and excess grain would be sold abroad, generating funds for industrial investment. In fact, resistance from the peasantry to land confiscation, along with poor planning, led to smaller yields.\n\nThe Soviets responded by accusing the kulaks (landowning peasants) of sabotage and grain hoarding. They were deemed class enemies, and many were killed or sent to the gulags. When poor harvests led to widespread hunger in the early 1930s, Stalin doubled down, trying to meet optimistic quotas by seizing peasants’ food supplies. The famine devastated grain-producing regions of the USSR: an estimated 5.7 to 8.7 million people died of starvation and linked diseases between 1930 and 1933.\n\nWhy was Ukraine particularly affected?\n\nA quarter of the world’s most fertile soil is in Ukraine, which has been famous as a grain exporter since antiquity. The Bolsheviks relied heavily on its grain, but they also deeply distrusted Ukraine.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution in 1917, an independent republic was declared in Ukraine, and a complex series of vicious conflicts were fought during the Russian civil war, before it became part of the USSR in 1922. As a grudging compromise, the Soviets adopted “Ukrainianisation”: support for its language and a measure of cultural independence.\n\nBut when Stalin targeted Ukraine for rapid collectivisation, many peasants resisted, some violently. The Soviets blamed this resistance, and crop failures resulting from Stalin’s policies, on nationalist feeling: Ukrainian communists and intellectuals were blamed, and the Soviets renewed their determination to extract as much grain as possible from Ukraine.\n\nWhat effects did this have?\n\nThe harvest of 1932 was poor, but state requisition targets were kept very high. When Ukrainian party leaders told Moscow that fulfilling the targets would mean mass starvation, they were classified as enemies and killed or imprisoned. As people began dying in spring 1932, requisitions proceeded, taking what the peasants needed to survive the winter, and even their seed corn for the next year.\n\nIn August, Stalin criminalised taking even a single grain of wheat from a collective farm. Party cadres toured the countryside searching out and confiscating any food as “fines”. Ukrainian peasants were banned from leaving the republic and from travelling to cities. Areas that didn’t meet grain targets were blacklisted, and cut off from the Soviet economy. Mass deaths began, on an almost unimaginable scale, in early 1933; Kyiv and Kharkiv provinces each recorded more than one million deaths.\n\nHow did the world react?\n\nThe Soviets denied throughout that a famine was taking place. A handful of foreign journalists reported on it, but most were successfully discouraged from doing so. Foreign nations made no interventions. Discussion of the famine was forbidden in the USSR until the 1980s, and its memory was mostly kept alive by Ukrainian émigrés, whose accounts of mass starvation – of peasants dying in the streets, and widespread cannibalism – were so horrifying that they were sometimes dismissed as Cold War propaganda. Even the opening of the Soviet archives hasn’t answered every question.\n\nDeath counts, estimated at 3.5 to five million people in Ukraine alone, or around 10% of its population, have had to be deduced because the data was falsified: when the 1937 census revealed drastically reduced population figures, Stalin had the statisticians responsible arrested and shot.\n\nWere Ukrainians singled out for persecution?\n\nCertainly: Stalin imposed the most brutal collectivist policies on Ukraine; he also purged its political leaders, and reversed “Ukrainianisation” by having Ukrainian-language schools and publications closed.\n\nUkrainian farmers elsewhere in the USSR, for instance in the Kuban region of the north Caucasus, were affected more than their neighbours. However, other parts of the Soviet Union, such as Lower Volga and Kazakhstan, suffered comparably.\n\nWas it a genocide?\n\nRaphael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the word in 1944, described the Ukrainian famine as “the classic example of the Soviet genocide”. But under the terms of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, it possibly doesn’t qualify: there has to be an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.\n\nAnne Applebaum, in her history Red Famine, argues that the Holodomor doesn’t entirely conform to that. The issue has become deeply politicised: in Russia today, the famine is seen as a “pan-Soviet tragedy” and talk of genocide is regarded as a provocation. Settling the issue is perhaps unnecessary, argues the Yale historian Timothy Snyder. Either way, it is “one of history’s great political atrocities”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/03"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/956126/pros-and-cons-of-no-fly-zone", "title": "The arguments for and against a no-fly zone | The Week", "text": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying he needs “to protect our sky” from the Russian assault on his country.\n\nBut Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and other world leaders have said repeatedly that they will not do so, instead offering resources to bulk up the country’s defences and offer refuge to Ukrainians fleeing the country.\n\nIf this position were to change, then certain aircraft would be banned from a designated airspace over Ukraine. The measure “has to be enforced by military means”, said the BBC, meaning any aircraft that enters the restricted zone could be brought down.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But Vladimir Putin’s forces have so far “failed to establish air superiority” and are “suffering huge aircraft losses as a result”, according to the Atlantic Council’s assessment of Russia’s military operation.\n\nA no-fly zone would impose a direct threat to Putin’s remaining stock of aircraft and troops should he continue to order aerial offences over Ukraine. Moscow’s losses so far stand at 14,000 troops and 194 helicopters and planes, according to disputed figures released by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.\n\nRussia’s air force is currently conducting “approximately two hundred sorties per day”, though many of these are outside Ukrainian airspace, the Atlantic Council said. Ukraine’s air force is much weaker than Putin’s and is currently “flying just five-to-ten sorties per day”.\n\n2. Con: High cost\n\nNo-fly zones require “one or more parties to be willing to enforce them – that is, being ready and able to shoot down any aircraft violating the space”, said The Guardian. The measure can therefore be “costly” as it relies on “constant air patrolling and monitoring”.\n\nThe US has established no-fly zones in the past “but unlike previous instances in Iraq, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Libya, which involved containing small and out-dated air forces, Russia has one of the largest air forces in the world – far larger than any in Europe”, said Time.\n\nEstablishing a zone over Ukraine would mean “top of the line American fighter jets… would need to be sent into the warzone all day and night, along with refuelling planes”. This means that costs could quickly mount up.\n\n3. Pro: Protecting civilians\n\nPresident Zelenskyy has been praised for his passionate speeches and commitment to remain in Ukraine with his citizens during the conflict. As of 15 March, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights put the total death toll of Ukrainian civilians at 726.\n\nZelenskyy believes a no-fly zone would reduce the harm to civilians as the conflict continues. Addressing his country this week, he asked: “What else do the occupiers have to do, how many more people do they have to kill in order for Western leaders, Nato leaders to respond positively to Ukraine’s request for a no-fly zone or for providing our country with the aircraft we so desperately need?”\n\nHe also promised that the country “will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers”.\n\n4. Con: Risk of escalation\n\nPutin has warned that “any move” towards imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be taken as a sign that the responsible party is a participant in the conflict. Imposing a no-fly zone would therefore “mark a significant escalation in the war” that could bring Nato “directly into a conventional conflict with a nuclear power”, said Axios.\n\nAnd indications that he may be prepared to resort to Russia's nuclear arsenal are further cause for hesitation. “Even the faintest hint of a world war which could become a nuclear war means, in spite of terrible scenes of civilians under attack, the likelihood of any no-fly zone in Ukraine is slim to none,” said the BBC.\n\n“Nato countries have decided that the risk of fighting against a nuclear-armed adversary is too great,” said Time.\n\n5. Pro: United front\n\nIn 1992, the UN banned unauthorised military flights from Bosnian airspace during the Balkans war, a no-fly zone that was patrolled by Nato forces.\n\nIn April 1994, the Nato alliance “crossed a major political boundary” when two American fighter planes attacked Serbian air forces near the “besieged town of Gorazde”, said The New York Times. It was the first time Nato “demonstrated its determination to protect United Nations personnel under fire”.\n\nIf the alliance were to enforce similar measures over Ukrainian airspace and use its defences to bolster Ukraine’s, it could demonstrate a defensive solidarity with the country.\n\n6. Con: Won’t stop war\n\nNo fly-zones are costly and risk more countries becoming directly involved in conflict with Russia. Additionally, they have “never stopped a war”, said national security specialists Christopher Michael Faulkner and Andrew Stigler on The Conversation.\n\nWhile Nato’s enforcement of a zone in Bosnia “may have reduced the Serbs’ opportunities to attack Bosnian Muslims and others”, the pair continued: “It is extremely hard to determine the number of civilian lives saved by past airspace bans.\n\n“What is certain, however, is that Russia… is a vastly different target than that of any prior airspace ban in the past 30 years.”", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/955916/poignant-stories-ukraine", "title": "The most poignant stories coming out of Ukraine | The Week", "text": "The people of Ukraine have had their lives rocked by the Russian invasion launched last week. Around 386,000 people are believed to have already fled their homes and at least 100 civilians have been killed, with the real figure feared to be “considerably higher”, according to the UN.\n\n“In the last days the world has witnessed awe-inspiring displays of bravery and heroism from the Ukrainian people in response to those who seek to obliterate their freedom by force,” said the UK’s prime minister Boris Johnson in a statement last night.\n\nHere are just some of the stories coming out of the war-torn nation.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Hannah Hopko, chair of the Democracy in Action Conference, shared a picture of one new mother with her baby Mia, born in an underground bomb shelter.\n\nThe Kyiv Independent estimated that at least six babies had been born in the country’s bomb shelters, including a metro station and others in maternity hospital shelters.\n\n‘Tank man’ of Ukraine\n\nVideo footage of a man kneeling in front of a Russian tank outside the city of Bakhmach went viral at the weekend, prompting comparisons to the “tank man” of Tiananmen Square. The “brave Ukrainian” tried to block the convoy of several tanks “with just his hands”, pushing one until it came to a complete stop, described The Independent. He then knelt on the ground before a number of people pulled him away.\n\nIn a separate clip, shared by Ukrainian news outlet HB, another man was seen standing in front of military vehicles as they swerved around him, reported The Guardian.\n\nFamilies separating\n\nSome of the most heartbreaking scenes in Ukraine have been of fathers bidding farewell to their children evacuating the country. The border agency has banned men aged 18 to 60 from leaving. One video captured a “sobbing Ukrainian father” saying goodbye to his daughter as she left with her mother, “exiting the country for at least the foreseeable future”, said the Daily Mail. The clip “gives a horrific glimpse into how the Eastern European conflict is tearing families apart”, said the New York Post.\n\nMolotov park meeting\n\nThe BBC recorded a surreal scene in Dnipro, south-east of Kyiv, over the weekend. A large group of women had gathered in a park with polystyrene, cheese graters and glass bottles to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their city. A teacher, named only as Arina, admitted that “nobody thought that this is how we would spend our weekend”, but that making fire bombs now seemed like “the only important thing to do”.\n\nZelenskyy’s bravery\n\nThe decision by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family to stay in the country while under Russian attack has “moved many”, said Steven Erlanger in The New York Times. The comedian-turned-politician “has become the leader Ukraine did not know it needed”, inspiring his citizens to fight for their country with “impassioned speeches” from the streets of Kyiv, said Erlanger. “Mr. Zelensky’s response to a reported American offer to evacuate him – ‘I need ammunition, not a ride’ – will most likely go down in Ukrainian history whether he survives this onslaught or not.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954149/what-does-the-cabinet-reshuffle-mean-for-the-next-election", "title": "What does the cabinet reshuffle mean for next election? | The Week", "text": "Boris Johnson is rebuilding his junior ministerial team today after appointing a new cabinet that he hopes will keep the Conservatives in power beyond 2024.\n\nThe prime minister “laid the groundwork for the next general election” with his “ruthless” cabinet reshuffle, in which Gavin Williamson lost his job as education secretary and Robert Buckland had his justice brief removed, said The Guardian.\n\nThe rejig “clears out failing ministers and rewards those with positive publicity”, the paper continued. Michael Gove was “handed the key job of making ‘levelling up’ a reality for sceptical voters”, while Liz Truss, “the media-savvy darling of Conservative grassroots members”, replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

And with the next general election expected in 2024, “Johnson must find a way of reassembling the coalition of traditional Tory voters and former Labour switchers that coalesced behind his ‘get Brexit done’ message in 2019”.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Johnson is “thought to believe delivering on his 2019 pledges will be critical to his hopes of winning the next election”, after he said last night that his new cabinet would “work tirelessly to unite and level up the whole country”.\n\nThe Telegraph suggested that the election could come even sooner than had been expected, with the PM potentially eyeing up a 2023 vote. After being shunted from his role as culture secretary to become party chair, Oliver Dowden reportedly told party staff yesterday: “You can’t fatten a pig on market day. It’s time to go to our offices and prepare for the next election.”\n\nAs commentators deliver their verdicts on the reshuffle, Politico’s Esther Webber argued that the initial impression is that Johnson has been “strengthened, with a tighter grip on the reins after what had started to look like a form of post-pandemic drift”.\n\nBut as well as a new focus on the domestic agenda, he has revealed a “willingness to wield the ax at the expense of loyal foot soldiers”, she added.\n\n“They treat alpacas better,” chimed in Quentin Letts in The Times, adding that Raab - demoted to justice secretary and deputy PM - apparently “refused to swallow the cyanide”, delaying Johnson’s schedule for the day. “Worse than getting our Patterdales to eat a worming tablet,” Letts quipped.\n\nBut for No. 10, it was a “day for the doers”, a “refreshed team that can get things done”, be it building houses, sorting school exams or pushing through tougher prison sentences, said the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.\n\n“Nearly two years after the election, it’s perhaps the start of Mr Johnson’s third act as prime minister,” she said. “And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/09/16"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955575/tonga-tsunami-aid-effort-turns-political", "title": "Tonga's tsunami: the aid effort turns political | The Week", "text": "The eruption of Tonga’s Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai underwater volcano on 15 January could be heard 5,800 miles away in Alaska, said Loop Tonga (Nuku’alofa).\n\nIt is thought to be the world’s biggest such event in 30 years: the blast spewed an ash plume 12 miles above the South Pacific archipelago, creating an ash umbrella 150 miles in diameter that blotted out the Sun, covering cars, roads and buildings in a film of residue.\n\nThe eruption also triggered a tsunami that had “a devastating impact” on some coastal areas and low-lying islands, said Matangi Tonga (Nuku’alofa). On Mango Island, “all houses were destroyed”. The confirmed death toll in Tonga is so far only three, including a British national, Angela Glover. One man, Lisala Folau, survived by swimming for 27 hours after being swept away by waves. But water supplies have been contaminated and infrastructure damaged; concerns over the fate of the outlying islands remain.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The single underwater cable on which the country relies for communications was ruptured; the ash cloud stopped planes carrying aid landing for days.\n\nFortunately, aid has now begun to arrive on ships and planes from Australia and New Zealand; but there are fears aid workers could bring Covid to the virus-free nation: last week, an Australian plane was turned back when a case was detected on board.\n\nTongans’ fears are “an echo of past trauma”, said Damien Cave in The New York Times. In the century after Captain Cook reached the region in the 1770s, Tonga faced imported epidemics of measles, dysentery and influenza. One measles outbreak in the early 19th century killed up to a quarter of its population. Inevitably, the virus is still “viewed through the lens” of past experience.\n\nThe aid effort has become something of a “geostrategic” tussle, said Michael Field in Nikkei Asia (Tokyo). Australia, New Zealand, the US and China are all offering aid. China’s influence in Tonga has been growing: Beijing awarded a US $108m loan (worth 25% of Tonga’s GDP) to rebuild after major riots in 2006 – a debt it has refused to write off.\n\nChina – which already has an “unexpectedly large” embassy in Tonga – senses a chance to bring a key South Pacific outpost under its influence; it is pushing for state-backed firm Huawei to bag a role repairing communications infrastructure. Beijing clearly has other motives here than its own “sense of humanitarianism”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Elliott Goat", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/955831/how-nasa-plans-to-destroy-the-international-space-station", "title": "How Nasa plans to destroy the International Space Station | The Week", "text": "Heather Muir, a PhD candidate in computational physics at Cambridge University, on the many risks involved in getting the station from orbit to the Pacific Ocean’s Point Nemo ‘spacecraft graveyard’\n\nNasa has announced plans for the International Space Station (ISS) to be officially decommissioned in 2031. After dozens of launches since 1998 got the station up and into orbit, bringing it down will be a feat of its own – the risks are serious if things go wrong.\n\nNasa’s plans for the decommissioning operation will culminate in a fiery plunge into the middle of the Pacific Ocean – a location called Point Nemo, also known as the “spacecraft graveyard”, the furthest point from all civilisation.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It has already been in operation for 21 years, and Nasa has given the go-ahead for one more decade, thereby doubling its total planned time in orbit.\n\nPurpose of the ISS\n\nThe ISS has enabled one giant leap for science and collaboration across mankind, involving five different space agencies (US, Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan). The modules and parts of the ISS have been built progressively by many different countries, only coming into contact for the first time in space.\n\nThe monumental conglomerate structure now stretches the length of a football field and is the largest human-made object in space. It is visible by the naked eye from Earth while it completes its 16 daily orbits, passing 400km above the Earth’s surface.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nResearch in the so-called microgravity environment of the ISS has yielded breakthroughs in drug discovery, vaccine development and medical treatments in the last decade. The ISS also helps to monitor Earth’s ecosystems and natural disasters in real time. It is used to test future spacecraft technologies and to study health effects of long-term space flight for the possibility of future human exploration of the solar system.\n\nDespite onboard research gaining momentum, Nasa has noticed signs of infrastructure and components slowing down. For every orbit around the Earth, the ISS gets scorched by solar radiation on one side, and freezes on the other. These thermal extremes cause cyclic expansion and contraction which wears the material. Space radiation chars the transparent glass on the solar cells which are used to power the station, and repeated docking and undocking causes gradual structure degradation, which will ultimately lead to its demise.\n\nThe rise of flying space junk also poses unplanned and catastrophic risk of destruction. In 2016, a fly-away speck of paint chipped a window, and just last year, ISS crew went into evacuation standby when Russia obliterated a dead satellite with a missile, causing thousands of pieces of debris to fly by the station at 5km per second. Despite this, Nasa assesses there is “high confidence” the station will see it through to the end of 2030.\n\nThe decommissioning operation\n\nWhile Nasa has committed to maintaining the station until 2030, its partner organisations are yet to officially sign on, meaning the final decision to de-orbit will depend on politics as much as engineering.\n\nIf degradation or unplanned damage occurs before the official decommissioning, a free-falling ISS poses serious dangers. In fact, it would not be the first space station to fall out of the sky. In 1979, Nasa’s Skylab station was not re-fuelled in time and came crashing down, out of control, leaving chunks of the station scattered across Australia. While no one was harmed, this led to reforms and “design for demise” guidelines.\n\nDesign for demise is an important principle for the engineering of satellites and other orbiting space infrastructure. Objects that fall freely from orbit must disintegrate into tiny pieces to make sure they don’t pose a danger to people on the ground.\n\nThe ISS is too large to satisfy the design for demise principle, which is why we need special operations for de-orbit. Experts estimate that if it were to crash down uncontrolled in a metropolitan area, the worst-case scenario could be on the scale of a “9/11 event”. However, this is highly improbable.\n\nIn the planned, controlled, de-orbit operation for the ISS, newly built modules will first detach from the main structure and remain in orbit to eventually recombine as parts of future space stations. The ISS will then be gently decelerated by onboard thrusters, causing its orbiting altitude to gradually lower over the course of a few months.\n\nThe remaining descent will be more rapid, but controlled by a series of spacecrafts sent to attach and steer the structure as it begins to plummet towards Earth. As it re-enters the atmosphere the majority of the structure will burn away, however the remaining mass should remain on a targeted trajectory to its deep-sea resting place.\n\nA Russian space station was previously brought safely down in the same way, however the ISS is approximately four times larger, so an operation on this scale remains untested.\n\nNew era\n\nBefore complete de-orbit in 2031, the ISS will first undergo a transition phase to sustain the crucial scientific research currently being conducted, and to form the basis of new industries in space.\n\nJeff Bazos’ Blue Origin recently announced plans to replace the ISS with the company’s privately operated space station. Other key players include Northropp Grumman and Axiom Space (partnered with SpaceX), who have a contract to start building modules off of the existing ISS as early as 2024.\n\nThere are also plans for a Russian space station which is likely to comprise modules detached from the existing ISS. Meanwhile, China launched the first module of their independent Tiangong Space Station last year, and plan to complete its expansion in the coming months.\n\nAt present, Nasa and its partner agencies oversee the use of their jointly owned infrastructure and are consulted on operations due to their governing expertise. However, times are changing and Nasa now purchases seats on board spacecraft owned by SpaceX. Ultimately, Nasa will become just another customer of commercial operators.\n\nHeather Muir, PhD candidate in computational physics, University of Cambridge.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence.

All the astronauts come back with stories like that. It’s very emotional to see this Earth, see the thin limb of the atmosphere.”\n\nThe billionaire founder and CEO of Amazon.com hopes his private space company, Blue Origin, will begin flying test pilots next year on suborbital rides of the booster and capsule he named New Shepard to honor the trailblazing NASA astronaut. Paying passengers will follow “when we’re ready,” he said.\n\n“We’re going to make it as safe as we can make it,” he told reporters and a crowd of onlookers. “We’re going to test it. We’re not going to take any shortcuts.”\n\nRelated:\n\nHow much does Jeff Bezos love space? $1 billion worth\n\nSpaceX Falcon 9 launches, lands in historic first\n\nNo ticket price has been set for the trips that will launch from western Texas and offer about four minutes of weightlessness, an experience similar to one that Virgin Galactic markets for $250,000.\n\nBut Bezos offered his future customers one bit of humorous advice: “Go to the bathroom in advance.”\n\nThe six-seat capsule lacks facilities, but he joked that shouldn’t be a problem on such a short flight. “If you have to pee in 11 minutes, you got problems,” he said.\n\nThe suborbital New Shepard system is a precursor to launches of the much larger New Glenn rocket now being designed for orbital missions. The New Glenn, named for first-American-in-orbit John Glenn, will be built in Florida at Kennedy Space Center’s Exploration Park and is targeting a 2020 first launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nIt will be years later before the rocket launches people into orbit, Bezos said, but that is his primary goal.\n\n“My singular focus is people in space,” he said. “Ultimately, most of our flights will be taking people into space. That is going to take a while.”\n\nBezos disclosed for the first time that he expects the New Glenn to cost about $2.5 billion to develop, mostly funded by his own money.\n\n“My business model right now for Blue Origin is I sell about a billion dollars a year of Amazon stock, and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,” he said.\n\nHe said it’s important that the company eventually become profitable and self-sustaining, “but it’s a long road to get there, and I’m happy to invest in it.”\n\nA 750,000-square-foot manufacturing facility at KSC’s Exploration Park is expected to be ready to start making New Glenn rocket stages in the first half of next year. Ground is being cleared at the Cape’s Launch Complexes 36 and 11 for a new launch pad and engine test stand.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket that has completed five launches and landings during unmanned tests has been on display outside the space industry’s biggest annual conference.\n\nThe booster arrived days after SpaceX became the first company to re-launch a larger booster capable of putting missions in orbit, with a Falcon 9 rocket’s March 30 satellite launch from KSC.\n\nBezos said he and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk are of the same mind that making rockets reusable represents the Holy Grail of spaceflight, holding the possibility of drastically lowering launch costs.\n\n“If we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,” he said. “You will see the same thing in space that I’ve witnessed on the Internet over the last 20 years, and believe me, that’s fun.”\n\nNext to the 50-foot-tall New Shepard booster, which is destined for a museum, Blue Origin this week has been offering Space Symposium attendees the chance to climb inside a mockup capsule to see its interior and sit in seats that will be used for space missions.\n\nThe cushioned black-and-blue seats with harnesses and head restraints will remain reclined throughout the suborbital flight to help distribute G-loads, which will reach about three times a person’s weight on Earth during ascent and briefly five-and-a-half times that weight during the capsule’s drop through the atmosphere.\n\nRelated:\n\nBuzz Aldrin really, really wants humans to go to Mars\n\nJeff Bezos is now the second-richest person in the world\n\nThe 1,000-square-inch, multi-paneled windows will be the largest flown in space. Backlit with blue light, the black window frames double as handles passenger can hold on to.\n\n“These are not the portholes Alan Shepard had,” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s head of business development and strategy, referring to Shepard’s compact Mercury program Freedom 7 spacecraft.\n\nTablet screens at each seat will offer camera views of the rocket lifting off and the capsule deploying parachutes. At landing, retro rockets will fire to soften a touchdown at about 2 mph. A round center console covers the abort engine that would allow the capsule to escape if the rocket were in danger of failing.\n\nWhile Bezos has wanted to fly in space since he was a kid, when he was inspired by NASA's Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, he acknowledged that he’s not sure how big the market for space tourism will be.\n\n“I’ve thrown parties before that nobody came to,” he said. “I don’t think that’s going to be the case here. I’m super-optimistic. But customers get to decide what the flight rates are. I hope they decide they want to fly.”\n\nFollow James Dean on Twitter: @flatoday_jdean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/tech/blue-origin-rocket-space-launch-thursday-scn/index.html", "title": "Blue Origin successfully completes fourth space tourism mission ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJeff Bezos’ Blue Origin just launched its fourth successful space tourism mission, putting yet another feather in the cap of the company that hopes to make these supersonic joyrides a mainstay of pop culture.\n\nThe six passengers, which include a Blue Origin engineer and five paying customers, boarded their New Shepard capsule Thursday just after sunrise at the company’s West Texas launch facilities. Boosted by a 60-foot-tall rocket, they soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. Their capsule vaulted past the Kármán Line at 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) altitude, which iswidely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins. And at the peak of the flight, they experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and, out their window, sweeping Earthly views.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the trip cost the five paying customers. Blue Origin has not publicly disclosed a fixed per-seat price point, though it had auctioned off a ticket for $28 million. But that was for a seat to ride alongside Bezos himself, and the auction winner didn’t end up going. (He is slated to fly later this year, however.) Blue Origin’s direct competitor, Virgin Galactic, is currently selling seats for $450,000, up from its previous price point of around $250,000.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nThis flight had been slated to include Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, but he dropped out of the mission after Blue Origin announced a schedule change earlier this month. The company cited the need for additional ground tests on the New Shepard rocketas the reason for the delay.\n\nGary Lai, who has been with Blue Origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket’s design, flew in Davidson’s place and was the sole non-paying customer on the flight. Lai’s crewmates included Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer, and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31.

He described outer space as the “blackest black I’ve ever seen,” adding that it was “breathtaking.” Nield called it “the thrill of a lifetime.”\n\n“Pictures don’t do it justice,” he added.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nBusiness activity in space — largely led by SpaceX — is booming. From building cheaper rockets and designing new uses for satellites to imagining futuristic space hotels, the industry has attracted record levels of investment, according to data collected by analytics firm Space Capital.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin made headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nStrahan wrote a message for the passengers on Thursday’s flight that was read to them by ground control: “This is the best ride you will ever have, but it’s way too short.”\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests — who thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nBlue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos’ flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company’s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says it’s undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nSpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three of his chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And next week, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.\n\nBlue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called the New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for the New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines.Its new rocket with the US-made BE-4 engines is scheduled to make its debut this year.\n\nBlue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2021/06/24/spacex-and-blue-origin-only-two-companies-seeking-new-space-age/7771674002/", "title": "SpaceX and Blue Origin only two of the companies seeking new ...", "text": "Editor's Note: The USA TODAY NETWORK will be auctioning its inaugural non-fungible token (NFT) inspired by the first newspaper delivered to space in 1971.

Ad astra!\n\nAmerican astronauts once again flying to the International Space Station from U.S. soil. An increasingly rapid rocket launch cadence that pushes up to one flight a week. New vehicles, spectators packing beaches, and a renewed drive to explore the moon.\n\nOn the surface, the current pace of space-related developments is on the upswing, especially in two areas: SpaceX's consistently successful missions to Earth orbit and increasing attention on NASA's Artemis return-to-the-moon program.\n\nBut if a new, more business-focused and mature Space Age really is approaching, it won't entirely depend on these two heavy-hitters – other companies commanding billions of dollars are hustling to fly their projects in the coming years and join the exclusive group of those who have reached space.\n\nOver the next two years alone, the companies below – just a portion of the thousands of space-related businesses – will play a significant role in how the future of spaceflight unfolds, especially in Earth orbit and on the moon. These are a few of the companies to keep an eye on.\n\nSpaceX\n\nCalifornia-based SpaceX's ambitions aren't limited to the Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule, both of which have demonstrated consistent flights with not only satellites, but also three astronaut crews bound for the International Space Station.\n\nCEO Elon Musk, however, is betting the house on Starship, a massive new vehicle being tested near the southern tip of Texas. Made up of a Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage transport ship, the combined system stands nearly 400 feet in height – that's taller than an Apollo-era Saturn V rocket – and is made of a reflective stainless steel.\n\nStarship has already flown several test missions in Texas, most of which have ended in explosive fashion as teams work out kinks in the system. Musk eventually hopes to use it for taking large payloads to Earth orbit and fulfill his long-term vision of a Mars colony, transporting dozens or even hundreds of people.\n\nSpaceX aims on flying Starship from both Texas and Florida. The established Falcon 9 rocket, meanwhile, can fly from Florida or Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nSo far, Starship has already received funding from NASA in the form of smaller technology development grants. NASA also selected a Starship variant as the vehicle that will officially transport Artemis program astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface – a $2.9 billion contract that's being hotly debated in Washington, D.C., and contested by rival Blue Origin.\n\nBlue Origin\n\nJeff Bezos-led Blue, meanwhile, is also developing a heavy-lift rocket comparable in size to Saturn V named New Glenn. The Seattle, Washington-based company has invested more than $1 billion into the Space Coast to build Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex 36 to its exact specifications.\n\nNew Glenn was slated to fly this year, but Blue recently confirmed the massive white-and-blue rocket won't debut until at least late 2022. Much like SpaceX's Falcon 9, New Glenn launches and then can land vertically on an ocean-based platform for recovery and cost savings.\n\nBezos sees LC-36 as the beginning of his \"road to space,\" a location from which he wants people to travel to Earth orbit, the moon, and beyond. Ultimately, he wants to see people living and working full-time in space.\n\nBut that dream isn't just for others – Bezos, too, wants to cross the boundary to space and is expected to do so during his company's first crewed flight on July 20. Both he and his brother will fly on the smaller New Shepard rocket from West Texas to a suborbital altitude, then land back where they started. New Shepard is Blue's tourism-focused rocket that launches on short, 11-minute flights.\n\nBlue Origin also leads the National Team, a partnership of four companies developing a version of the landing system that will transport NASA astronauts to the moon's surface. The recent selection of SpaceX as the only winner of the $2.9 billion contract, however, has led to frictions in Washington and a protest filed with the Government Accountability Office remains unresolved.\n\nRelativity Space\n\nBehind the scenes, a smaller company named Relativity Space is aiming to become the first to fully 3D print rockets using the world's largest metal printers.\n\nCalifornia-based Relativity, like SpaceX, plans on assembling its Terran 1 rocket near Los Angeles, then transporting it to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station via truck. Part of its mission also includes reusing rocket hardware to lower costs, but 3D printing as many of a rocket's components as possible is the core goal.\n\nSo far, Relativity has raised well north of $1 billion with financial help from giants like Fidelity, pushing its overall valuation to more than $4 billion. The first flight of Terran 1 is expected before the end of this year and the recently announced Terran R – comparable in size and lifting capability to SpaceX's Falcon 9 – is on track for a 2024 debut.\n\nThe company is currently renovating Launch Complex 16, a pad built in the late 1950s for ballistic missile tests. It also wants to launch from Vandenberg like SpaceX, but Florida is the current priority.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance\n\nOn the more established side of space companies is United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that currently flies Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rockets from Florida and California.\n\nSince 2018, however, ULA has been scaling down its offerings. Ultimately, its entire fleet will be retired in the coming years to make way for Vulcan Centaur, a new vehicle that won't stand as tall as Starship or New Glenn, but will have medium-to-heavy lift capabilities.\n\nVulcan is intimately tied to the previously mentioned Blue Origin, which sells BE-4 engines to ULA for the rocket's first stage. The shift allowed ULA to move away from the Russian-made RD-180 that currently powers its most popular Atlas V rocket.\n\nThough it was expected to fly for the first time before the end of this year, Vulcan is now targeting 2022 for its premiere at Launch Complex 41.\n\nFirefly Aerospace\n\nFirefly is yet another example of a company working behind-the-scenes to build not only launch vehicles, but coast-to-coast launch pads. Its Alpha rocket is expected to fly from Vandenberg for the first time this year.\n\nThe company was also selected by NASA to produce a moon lander for the Artemis program that will take several scientific payloads to the surface. That project alone was valued at $93.3 million.\n\nBeyond that, the Cedar Park, Texas-based company has been valued at more than $1 billion after raising hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2019, Firefly leadership officially took ownership of Launch Complex 20 at Cape Canaveral after entering into a lease agreement with the Space Force.\n\nThe 95-foot Alpha rocket could fly its demonstration mission as soon as this summer.\n\nSome going public\n\nSome smaller launchers that have already flown, meanwhile, are becoming more mainstream conversation-starters thanks to their joining Wall Street as publicly traded companies.\n\nSmall satellite lifters Rocket Lab and Astra, for example, have already begun trading in the wildly popular world of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Their shell companies currently trade under HOL and VACQ, respectively, but will change to ASTR and RKLB after the mergers are complete. They both join Virgin Galactic, the space tourism-focused branch of Virgin that was one of the first to go public in 2019.\n\nYet others like Redwire Space, which doesn't make launch vehicles but provides other hardware services like the newly deployed rollout solar arrays on the ISS, are also publicly traded.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

The first time an Atlas V rocket has lifted astronauts into space. The first launch of humans from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41.\n\nBut on a day of firsts, there is one thing that's not: the two NASA astronauts flying Starliner to the International Space Station bring with them extensive experience in space and at the orbiting outpost. Astronaut Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, the Starliner pilot, described the mission last week as \"feeling like going home.\"\n\nWilliams and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore , the mission commander, share Navy test pilot backgrounds and both have flown on two NASA missions to the station. Both have been training years for this flight, as they waited through multiple delays. The Starliner, like SpaceX's Dragon, is being contracted by NASA to ferry crews to-and-from the ISS.\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention ... they are checking out a lot of the systems, the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots onboard.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule is set to launch atop the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on the Crewed Flight Test mission at 10:34 p.m. Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41. The early weather outlook appears good with a 95 percent chance of acceptable conditions for launch.\n\n\"We’re at peak performance right now and we’re really looking forward to executing this weekend, executing the launch and executing the mission in the same way that we got here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Starliner program. \"We’re ready to go.\"\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the mission.\n\nDon't miss the next rocket launch:Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, ULA, NASA in Florida\n\nWhere will Starliner launch from?\n\nStarliner will launch from Space Force Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe pad has been the launch site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965. Other notable missions include the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nWhat has never happened from the pad before: the launch of humans. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nTo prepare for this mission, the launch complex recently saw the addition of a crew access arm.\n\nAnother interesting note: the last crewed launch from this military side of the Cape occurred in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. All other crewed launches since have taken place from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nAlso, this will be only the sixth time in history NASA astronauts have flown a new spacecraft. These include: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, Dragon, and now Starliner.\n\nRole of Boeing Starliner in NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nThe day the Starliner spacecraft was finally mated to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket for the crew flight test was a long time coming for the team at Boeing.\n\nNASA originally awarded Boeing the contract to fly astronauts in 2014, alongside SpaceX. Boeing received $4.8 billion for Starliner while SpaceX received $3.1 billion for Dragon. Both companies were part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which replaced the space shuttle after its retirement in 2011.\n\nBoth were late to deliver, hoping to launch as soon as 2017 and restore NASA astronauts access to space from American soil (NASA astronauts were hitching rides aboard the Russian Soyuz).\n\nFollowing a successful crewed demo flight in 2020, SpaceX has since flown eight NASA crews and multiple private crews to the ISS.\n\nAfter facing multiple setbacks, including issues found after a successful uncrewed docking with the ISS and landing in 2022, Boeing hopes to prove the capability of its Starliner spacecraft to take on its designated role ferrying NASA crews to the station.\n\nOnce successful, Starliner will fly NASA crews in rotation with SpaceX's Dragon− a needed redundancy to ensure NASA access to low Earth orbit.\n\nGoing beyond this test flight, according to Boeing, NASA has already contracted for six crewed missions on Starliner.\n\nNASA astronaut and former NASA Associate Administrator and former KSC Director Bob Cabana told FLORIDA TODAY that the success of Boeing Starliner is essential to ensure NASA always has a way to access the station.\n\n“We want that dissimilar redundancy,” said Cabana, adding that NASA cannot rely on solely one company.\n\nWith the commercial crew program charged with ensuring access to low Earth orbit, NASA continues to work on its Artemis program, which will fly a crew around the Moon as soon as late 2025. That will mark the first time humans have returned to the Moon since the Apollo missions ended over five decades ago.\n\nNASA's confidence in Starliner\n\nFLORIDA TODAY spoke with Kim Ess, manager of the Integrated Performance Office (IPO) in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) at Johnson Space Center. Ess explained that NASA has done demonstration testing alongside Boeing to ensure the safety of the spacecraft.\n\n\"We took more risks when it was just a test flight,\" Ess said on the topic of the second uncrewed flight in 2022. \"Now that our payload, our two crew members, Butch and Suni, we did a lot more research.\"\n\nShe explained that NASA provided Boeing requirements to meet before this crewed flight, and Boeing returned with the necessary results.\n\n\"In many cases, we do an independent verification of those requirements,\" Ess said. She used the example of Boeing demonstrating that they would be able to return the crew safely during a simulation of the landing. NASA ran the same simulation at the organization's Johnson Space Center to compare the data.\n\n\"Any differences, we bring in and we talk with them and see 'okay, did you have an error in your model, or did we have an error in our model, or are these true differences?'\" Ess said.\n\n\"As long as they're along the same lines, we're good. And we have done that extensively for this flight,\" Ess said.\n\nWhat is the Starliner spacecraft?\n\nBoeing calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply “Starliner”. Like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, it can carry a mix of crew and cargo or up to seven crew memebers.\n\nWith a total height of 16.5 ft (capsule + service module combined) and a diameter of 15 ft, it is a what Boeing refers to as \"a next-generation space capsule.\"\n\nThis Starliner spacecraft has a name\n\nThe capsule flying Monday was named Calypso by Williams.\n\nWilliams, a lover of the ocean, has stated in the past that she named the spacecraft Calypso after the ship of Jacque Cousteau, which was an ocean explorer in the mid-20th century.\n\nThat ship was remembered for its underwater observation chamber and being equipped with a helicopter and submersibles, assisting in scientific expeditions. Williams mentioned being excited by Cousteau's television show as a young girl and looked forward to watching his expeditions.\n\nWilliams has a special connection to Brevard County\n\nAfter gaining a B.S. in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Williams graduated from Florida Tech in 1995 with her M.S. in Engineering Science.\n\nLast year, she gave a commencement speech to the 2023 Florida Tech graduates.\n\nWilliams' first chance to fly to space came when assigned to STS-116. On December 9, 2006, Williams and crew took off onboard Space Shuttle Discovery for a six month stay onboard the ISS.\n\nWilliams returned to the ISS during Expedition 32/33. Launching from Kazakhstan in a Soyuz spacecraft on July 14, 2012, Williams saw another long stay onboard the space station. After that 127-day visit to space, she accumulated a total of 322 days spent off the planet.\n\nNow, she said, she's been waiting a long time for this moment.\n\n\"With each launch that was rescheduled, I've been given perspective I would've never had without those delays,\" Williams said before going on to explain how the crew not only got more time to learn about the spacecraft, but to also help shape the Starliner program.\n\nThe Starliner crew's playlist and ride to the pad\n\nDuring a preflight NASA Q and A, Wilmore and Williams mentioned the new Astro Van. Unlike SpaceX crews, who ride in a Tesla, Boeing astronauts will ride to the rocket in a new van. This ride to the pad is reminiscence of the shuttle days, during which NASA astronauts rode in a similar van.\n\nOf course, there will be music on the way.\n\nAsked what would be on their playlist, Wilmore quipped \"Epic music.\" Smiling, he added, \"It's in a fight scene in Top Gun Maverick, it's on my playlist.\"\n\nGuardians at the Gate and Freedom Fighters are two songs Wilmore has on his list.\n\nWilliams, however, is going for a more relaxing feeling before launch. \"A bit of Country Western and a little bit of Pop. I got a little bit of Kenney Chesney, a little bit of Zac Brown ready to go,\" she said.\n\nHow to watch Boeing Starliner launch\n\nFLORIDA TODAY's Space Team will continue to bring you the latest information on the mission. While the launch is currently set for 10:34 p.m. Monday, various factors can change this.\n\nFollow the FLORIDA TODAY Live Blog on launch day as we await the liftoff of Starliner.\n\nTo received launch alerts and updates, download the free FLORIDA TODAY app and enable push alerts from the app settings.\n\nA night launch is difficult to miss under clear conditions. If you are on the Space Coast, simply look towards the sky above the area south of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nShould conditions Monday night cause a scrub, the next backup launch opportunity is 10:11 p.m. Tuesday. But so far, weather looks like it will cooperate.\n\nWhat awaits the Starliner crew on the space station\n\nPlans call for Starliner to dock with the station about 26 1/2 hours after launch.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will be busy testing all aspects of Starliner. Being a test flight, demonstrating that the spacecraft preforms as it should will be the crew's main focus.\n\nEss told FLORIDA TODAY that one of the biggest objectives is the crew's ability to take manual control of Starliner. While Starliner is autonomous, there must be the ability to control the spacecraft manually in case of an emergency situation.\n\n\"Prior to docking to the space station ... we're going to approach and then stop, and the crew is going to go through several flight test objectives for manual control and demonstrate that they can do it,\" said Ess.\n\nEss said the crew also will be monitoring the spacecraft's software performance.\n\nOnce Starliner receives certification to fly NASA crews, it will carry a crew of four on Starliner-1. For this reason, Williams and Wilmore stated during a May 1st press briefing that Crew-8, four astronauts who are currently onboard the ISS, will provide assistance in checking out that the spacecraft can comfortably fit a crew of four in space.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore stated that they plan to give Crew-8 the full Starliner tour.\n\nWhile their stay onboard the ISS is expected to be approximately eight days, there remains the possibly of this stay being extended due to various factors, such as weather at the landing site. As experienced NASA astronauts, Williams and Wilmore have the training needed to jump in and assist on the ISS if needed.\n\nWhere will Starliner land?\n\nAfter spending approximately a week on the International Space Station thoroughly testing every function of the spacecraft, the Starliner crew will return to Earth.\n\nLanding will not be like in the SpaceX Dragon, which lands in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nStarliner, as it did successfully in the uncrewed test flights, will land under a parachute system and airbags in the New Mexico desert. Boeing refers to it as a \"soft landing\".\n\nSpaceX also targeting Monday\n\nThere could be a doubleheader launch Monday.\n\nSpaceX is targeting a Monday morning Starlink mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, navigational warnings indicate.\n\nThough SpaceX has not publicly announced this mission, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Coast Guard maritime safety bulletins show a Starlink launch window will open Monday from 11:34 a.m. to 4:05 p.m. EDT. SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets on its Starlink missions deploying satellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor the latest on the launch, go to floridatoday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

The Indialantic resident and Eau Gallie restaurateur has reversed that trend — he left his Space Coast home and traveled roughly 1,600 miles to Texas to fly aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket on Thursday morning.\n\nDuring a post-flight press conference, Young became emotional while trying to describe seeing the blue line of Earth's mesosphere and the black line of space outside the capsule windows.\n\n“I’m thankful that I got to experience that. I had, obviously, a very emotional touch from it. And I’m going to leave it at that,\" Young said, holding a microphone and fighting back tears.\n\n\"But, thank you. Thank you for giving me this,\" he said, patting his chest.\n\nOwner of Pineapples:Eau Gallie restaurateur set to fly to space Thursday on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket\n\nSteve Young:Owner of Pineapples in Eau Gallie to fly into space on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket\n\nYoung's flight came on a busy day for space travel. Earlier Thursday morning, an Atlas V rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, lofting a Space Force satellite to orbit. Meanwhile, SpaceX was poised to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape in the evening.\n\n“I think it is exciting that we have a hometown boy flying,\" said Dale Ketcham, Space Florida vice president of government and external relations.\n\n\"And I like the sheer coincidence of him flying from Texas on the same day we're — for the first time in 50 years — flying two flights in one day,\" Ketcham said.\n\nYoung joined five fellow astronauts on Blue Origin's NS-22 mission, which launched just before 10 a.m. from the company's Launch Site One near rural Van Horn, Texas.\n\nThe NS-22 mission marked Blue Origin's sixth human spaceflight and the 22nd flight for the New Shepard program.\n\nCrew members named their mission \"the Titanium Feather\" — titanium is the 22nd element on the periodic table.\n\nThe suborbital rocket-capsule tandem separated about 47 miles above Earth. Then the 10-foot-tall capsule continued climbing past the 100-kilometer Kármán Line, letting its \"space tourist\" passengers float for a few minutes of microgravity.\n\n\"Congratulations to all six crew of the Titanium Feather. They just officially became astronauts with an apogee well over 100 kilometers, the internationally recognized boundary line of space,\" Blue Origin commentator Eduardo Seyffert said during a live webcast.\n\n\"Both the crew capsule and booster are now descending,\" Seyffert added.\n\nThe booster returned to the ground for a fiery landing. The capsule entered freefall, slowed after a trio of parachutes deployed, and touched down at 10:07 a.m. in the West Texas desert.\n\nA fleet of trucks swarmed the capsule, and crew workers \"grounded\" the capsule to prevent static discharge. Then the newly minted astronauts descended a blue portable platform ladder to greet loved ones.\n\nMission elapsed time was 10 minutes, 20 seconds, Blue Origin announced.

Isaacman and his crew arrived in late August at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to finalize preparations for liftoff, which has since been delayed three times as SpaceX looks for a viable launch date.\n\nWhen Polaris Dawn does finally get underway, ahead of the crew is a daunting journey to the upper reaches of Earth's orbit where they will spend five pivotal days performing tests that could set the stage for future deep space exploration.\n\nHere's what to know about Polaris Dawn, its potentially historic mission and its intrepid crew.\n\nBoeing Starliner:Astronauts won’t return until 2025\n\nWhat is the Polaris Dawn mission?\n\nPolaris Dawn is far from simply a billionaire-funded joyride to space.\n\nWhile in orbit, Isaacman and the crew will endeavor to make history while testing space technology on behalf of SpaceX that could prove crucial as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars.\n\nThe objectives for the crew's five-day stay aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule include:\n\nReach altitudes higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program came to an end in the 1970s: The Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through the treacherous Van Allen radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.\n\nThe Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through the treacherous Van Allen radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station. Attempt to become the first-ever private citizens to conduct a spacewalk while 435 miles above Earth: Two crewmembers will open the hatch and exit the spacecraft while wearing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX. But because the Dragon does not have an airlock, its entire interior will be exposed to the vacuum of space, meaning all four astronauts will wear the suits to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\nTwo crewmembers will open the hatch and exit the spacecraft while wearing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX. But because the Dragon does not have an airlock, its entire interior will be exposed to the vacuum of space, meaning all four astronauts will wear the suits to receive oxygen through tethers. Conduct nearly 40 scientific experiments and test a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink – all while using the publicity to raise funds for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nOn the sixth day of the mission, the SpaceX vehicle will reenter Earth's atmosphere and splash down at one of seven sites off the Florida coast.\n\n\"We hope the results from our mission will accelerate SpaceX’s vision to make life multiplanetary,\" Isaacman said in a statement. \"Throughout our mission, we will aim to inspire humankind to look up and imagine what we can achieve here on Earth and in the worlds beyond our own.”\n\nHow to watch the Polaris Dawn launch\n\nIt could be a matter of days until the four-member crew of Polaris Dawn will finally be able to embark on their Earth orbit mission when they board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nDespite a series of launch scrubs, the Falcon 9 and Dragon remained vertical on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center as of Thursday, Aug. 29, SpaceX said in its most recent update.\n\nWhen the launch does finally get underway, SpaceX will stream the takeoff via X, formerly Twitter; the NASA facility also sold tickets to watch the launch in person at the Florida base.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, will provide live coverage starting about two hours before liftoff at floridatoday.com/space.\n\nWhy has Polaris Dawn been delayed?\n\nThe Polaris Dawn mission has been scheduled for launch three times since Isaacman and his crew arrived to quarantine in Cape Canaveral, and all three launches were scrubbed.\n\nMost recently, the Falcon 9 rocket was slated for a Aug. 28 liftoff before SpaceX scrubbed the mission at the last minute due to poor weather forecasted for their return to Earth. Because Polaris Dawn is not docking with the International Space Station, a favorable weather forecast is crucial not just for the launch, but also for the crew's water landing five days later off the Florida coast.\n\nThe launch had also previously been delayed to provide more time for preflight checks, and also when a helium leak – since fixed – was detected.\n\nFortunately, the mission was not threatened when the Federal Aviation Administration briefly grounded Falcon 9 rockets last week following a landing mishap.\n\nWhat are the Van Allen radiation belts?\n\nThe Van Allen belts pose one of the largest hazards to future spacefarers venturing deep into the cosmos.\n\nAccording to NASA, the belts are two areas of trapped cosmic radiation in the magnetosphere surrounding Earth like \"an enormous donut.\" The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the sun, whereas the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe International Space Station's orbit keeps the outpost safely below the radiation belts, but future astronauts will have to fly through them to reach the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nWhen the Polaris Dawn crew travels through the radiation belts, their SpaceX craft’s nose will be oriented to minimize the astronauts’ exposure to harmful radiation.\n\n\"In the future, if we are going to have (SpaceX) Starships regularly going to the moon or Mars, we are going to have to fly through the Van Allen belts regularly,\" Isaacman told Florida Today in an email.\n\nWhy is it called the Polaris Program?\n\nThe space program is named after Polaris, a constellation of three stars more commonly known as the North Star – a guiding navigational light throughout human history.\n\nWho is Jared Isaacman, billionaire behind Polaris Dawn?\n\nIsaacman, a billionaire who helped bankroll the Polaris Dawn mission, won't be watching from the ground when it takes off: The experienced aviator and adventurer from Pennsylvania will be aboard the Dragon capsule and will serve as the mission commander.\n\nIsaacman famously dropped out of high school at 16 years old to start his internet company Shift4 Payments and in recent years has become something of an avid spacefarer.\n\nIn 2021, he served as mission commander of Inspiration4, the world’s first all-civilian mission to space that introduced commercial space tourism to the world. The mission, which Isaacman self-funded, saw four civilians head to space for three days in orbit, raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nWith more than 7,000 flight hours of aviation experience, Isaacman is also an aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly military fighter jets.\n\nIsaacman said in his email to Florida Today that he didn't expect to go to space again after the Inspiration4 mission.\n\n\"I was not planning to go back until after visiting Elon at Starbase in October of 2021,\" Isaacman said in an email to the outlet. \"At that point, we discussed possibilities for test and development missions that would help move the needle on SpaceX's bigger vision to make life multi-planetary.\"\n\nMeet the rest of the Polaris Dawn crew\n\nIsaacman will lead a crew that includes a pilot and two mission specialists.\n\nPilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet ,\n\nMission specialist Sarah Gillis, a Colorado native who is a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, where she is responsible for overseeing the company’s astronaut training program.

Menon, of Houston, has written a children’s book, \"Kisses from Space,\" which was inspired by her experience preparing for the Polaris Dawn mission and her desire to share her spaceflight experience with her two young children. She plans to read it from space during the mission.\n\nWhat's next for the Polaris Program?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nThe second mission \"will continue to expand the boundaries of future human spaceflight missions, in-space communications, and scientific research,\" according to the program's website. Additional details, including a launch date, have not yet been announced.\n\nWhen the day comes that the third and final Polaris Program mission launches, it's intended to be the first human spaceflight on the SpaceX Starship rocket. The gargantuan rocket, which has so far only undergone uncrewed tests, will one day ferry NASA astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon's surface as part of the space agency's Artemis program.\n\nContributing: Brooke Edwards, Florida Today\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

And Dylan Taylor, a lifelong space enthusiast-turned-investor in the burgeoning private space sector, shared almost the entirety of the journey as viewed from inside the capsule, from the time the passengers strapped in until they touched back down on terra firma.\n\nBess and Taylor flew alongside Good Morning America host Michael Strahan, and the daughter of the late NASA astronaut Alan Shepard, Laura Shepard Churchley, in a flight that took off on December 11, 2021. Strahan and Shepard Churchley both flew free of charge as honored guests, while Bess and Taylor were among four paying customers on the trip. They both declined to share how much their tickets cost.\n\nBess identifies as LGBTQ+ and a furry, which is the term used to refer to people who enjoy anthropomorphic versions of animals and “want to be part of a community about that,” as Bess describes it. They posted their footage, which includes an extensive Q&A about their experience, on their YouTube channel, which Bess named after their furry persona, “MeepsKitten.” Portions of Bess’ and Taylor’s videos are reposted here with their permission.\n\nMuch of their footage was captured by on-board cameras and edited by Blue Origin before being sent to the passengers as a momento, they said, revealing how the passengers reacted to various moments of the experience.\n\nBess notes, for example, that the sunshine from outside the window is blinding during ascent, and the group experiences more than 2.2 Gs pressing them into their reclined seats. As the rocket continues vaulting upward and the sky begins to fade from blue to black, Bess notes “my eyes are watering,” because they didn’t want to take their eyes off the view despite the blinding light.\n\nCNN Business also conducted separate phone interviews with Bess and Taylor about their experiences. Additional comments that Bess made in their YouTube Q&A have been included below.\n\nWhat happened while they were waiting for liftoff?\n\nThe footage Taylor shared from inside the capsule tells it all.\n\n“I feel like a million bucks,” Taylor says.\n\nKevin Sproge, the Blue Origin employee who helped strap the passengers in before launch, tells Shepard Churchley, “Your dad would be so proud.”\n\n“I know,” she responds.\n\nThe passengers on Blue Origin's NS-19 flight in a hand out image from the company. Pictured from left to right: Dylan Taylor, Lane Bess, Cameron Bess, Laura Shepard Churchley, Michael Strahan, and Evan Dick. Dylan Taylor/Blue Origin\n\nBezos also climbs aboard the capsule briefly to address Shepard Churchley as they await launch.\n\n“When your father became the first American to go into space six decades ago, it took the entire resources of a nation state — a determined nation state — to do that. And today, you guys can do it in a completely different way. That, for humanity, is what’s called progress. Big things start small. This is how it starts,” Bezos said.\n\n“I’m happy to be on it,” Shepard Churchley replies.\n\nThey wait about 40 minutes in their seats aboard the capsule, as Blue Origin finishes the necessary technical checks, before the rocket takes off.\n\n“Let’s light this candle!” Shepard Churchley screams before adding, “My God,” as the capsule begins to soar upward.\n\nHow did training help them prepare?\n\nIn their video, Bess also shared details about the pre-flight training, noting that — because Blue Origin’s rocket and capsule system is fully autonomous — they only have to prepare for emergency scenarios. And, to get acquainted with the visceral experience of riding aboard a supersonic rocket, the passengers would sit inside their training capsule as the sound of a rocket engine firing blared at full volume.\n\nAt the end of the training regimen, the passengers took a multiple-choice test to ensure they’d retained the most important bits of information, which Bess described in their YouTube video as “easier than the written drivers’ test.”\n\nOverall, the training was helpful, though “there’s a big difference between just playing the sounds and feeling it all,” they told CNN Business.\n\nTaylor also told CNN Business “you are fitted with custom earplugs, so it’s not quite loud.”\n\nWhat can you see from space?\n\nThe passengers enjoy weightlessness for only a few minutes, and they’re allowed to scramble from their seats, flipping and gazing out the window to soak in and the most sweeping views of the flight.\n\n“This is heaven. Holy smokes,” Shepard Churchley says.\n\nTaylor said he could recognize the Rocky Mountains below and see out to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n“My perception — and it was just a brief one — was that I could see pretty much the entire North American continent more or less,” Taylor told CNN Business.\n\nBess looks out the window as the passengers experience Zero-G at the top of New Shepard's flight path. Dylan Taylor/Blue Origin\n\nTaylor noted that he looked for the moon, which he couldn’t see. And when asked whether stars were visible while the passengers were in space, Bess says they weren’t.\n\n“It was just black, the blue line of atmosphere around the Earth — which is round,” Bess notes in their YouTube video, “and then just the clouds and the mountains and all of that below.”\n\nWhat really stood out, as Bess, Taylor and numerous other passengers before them noted, is the thin blue line of atmosphere blanketing the Earth.\n\n“It’s like that entire blue is what you look up and see for your entire life,” Bess told CNN Business. “And then now it’s below you — and you can see right right through it.”\n\nHow did it feel to experience nearly 6Gs on the way back down?\n\nAs the capsule begins to fall back toward Earth, the passengers scrambled back into their seats and braced for the most intense G-forces of the journey. Bess and Taylor note that they reached up to about 6 Gs — or the feeling of six times the force of Earth’s gravity — and the footage shows labored facial expressions spreading across the passengers’ faces.\n\nThe NS-19 New Shepard capsule parachutes to a landing in December 2021. Blue Origin\n\n“Your face literally gets pulled back [and] it was hard to breathe a little bit,” Bess told CNN Business. “I personally — nobody else in the crew had this — but I tend to have some blood circulation issues, and I actually started to get the tunnel vision, your vision going black…It wasn’t bad. But, you know, it was intense.”\n\nThey added that they imagined the sensation was similar to being stuffed under a “300 pound weighted blanket.”\n\nThe passengers could only feel all 6 Gs for about 10 seconds, Taylor added, but it was still intense.\n\nWas any of it painful?\n\nBess noted they didn’t experience any issues with inner ear pressure during the rapid altitude change because the cabin was pressurized, though they did experience a bit of motion sickness near the end of their zero gravity experience.\n\n“But it was manageable,” they said.\n\nBess also noted that the landing, while perhaps among the most visually jarring because of the large puff of desert sand the capsule sets off upon touch down, is actually “one of the least rough parts of the entire flight” because air jets that Blue Origin has installed on the bottom of the capsule provided a nice cushion.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket takes flight for the NS-19 mission in December 2021. Blue Origin\n\nBut after the rocket engine then quits firing, and the cabin immediately shifts into zero gravity, there is a jolting thump as the crew capsule separates from the rocket.\n\n“You’re essentially blowing the two vehicles apart,” Taylor told CNN Business. “It’s pretty violent. It kind of felt like a little bit of a slow motion car crash, maybe. Very, very jolting. So that was a bit of a surprise.”\n\nWhat did this mission mean to you?\n\nBess shared their thoughts on what it meant to them to be representing the LGBTQ+ community and furries “in such a big first.”\n\n“I can’t represent these groups perfectly because they’re such diverse groups, and that’s kind of what makes them special,” Bess said in their YouTube video. “But I’m just glad to be providing, you know, a vector of visibility because visibility really leads to normalization. It’s when you’re kept invisible that I think it can lead to a misunderstanding of character or what you stand for.”\n\nThey added that “it’s incredibly special that the book of history of the first parent and child in space is one of a queer child and that their parents are accepting of that and went on this journey with them.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Blue Origin said “it was an honor to fly Cameron and their father, Lane, on New Shepard. In addition to being the first parent-child in space, they’re also early pioneers in Blue Origin’s vision of millions of people living and working in space for the benefit of Earth.”\n\nWould you go back to space?\n\nTaylor is also a ticket holder on Virgin Galactic, the venture founded by British billionaire Richard Branson that uses a rocket-powered plane to brush the edge of space. That company hopes to begin regular commercial flights later this year, though Taylor expects a few hundred people who reserved their seats before him will get to go first.\n\n“I would like to go orbital, and I’m actively considering that,” Taylor told CNN Business, referencing the type of flights currently offered by SpaceX. He declined to share details about those conversations.\n\nShepard Churchley celebrates after the NS-19 mission. Dylan Taylor/Blue Origin\n\nTaylor, who also donated the equivalent of his Blue Origin ticket price to several philanthropies, is also advocating for other wealthy explorers to do the same. And he founded a nonprofit, called Space For Humanity, that will offer a trip to space for “exceptional leaders,” free of charge.\n\n(Sorry, applications closed in February.)\n\n“Hopefully we’ll be flying people soon,” Taylor said.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/22/odysseus-lunar-lander-makes-history-moon-spacex-launch/72660310007/", "title": "Odysseus becomes 1st American lander to reach the moon in 52 years", "text": "For the first time in more than five decades, Americans have returned to the moon.\n\nWell, American robots, at least.\n\nA week after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket, the uncrewed Odysseus spacecraft gently touched down on the surface of the moon late Thursday, ushering in a historic moon landing.\n\nThe lander, designed and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, is now the first commercial spacecraft to ever land on the moon. The lunar landing is also the first by an American-built spacecraft since NASA's final Apollo mission in 1972.\n\n\"Houston, Odysseus has found its new home,\" Stephen Altemus, president and CEO of Intuitive Machines, said shortly after the landing at 5:23 p.m. CST.\n\nThe announcement came about 10 minutes after it happened after some communications challenges. Tension built as the team behind the IM-1 mission waited for confirmation with bated breath.\n\n\"I know this was a nail-biter, but we are on the surface and we are transmitting,\" Altemus said. \"Welcome to the moon.\"\n\nWhat is the Odysseus lunar lander?\n\nNicknamed for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" the Odysseus lander hitched a ride to orbit last Thursday aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nRead more: What Odysseus will do now.\n\nIntuitive Machines built the Odysseus to carry cargo for NASA and other private customers to the lunar surface for its IM-1 mission.

An engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nThe tests set the Odysseus craft up to enter lunar orbit Wednesday ahead of its landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region. Scientists have long been interested in studying the south pole because of the water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines is working with NASA\n\nIntuitive Machines' lunar mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface. The success of Intuitive Machines in putting a lander on the moon will now pave the way for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon. The instruments will collect valuable data for NASA as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its Artemis program for the first time since the last Apollo mission 52 years ago.\n\nNASA's Artemis program mission delayed\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon ahead of a moon landing itself a year later for Artemis III. But the Artemis program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues, including a battery flaw on the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the moon.\n\nOnce NASA is back on track in the years ahead, the agency intends to send a crew to the moon's south polar region, where it will will lay the groundwork for NASA to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of future missions to Mars.\n\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers and Mike Snider.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The mission is the first crewed orbital test flight for Boeing after two previous demonstrations with no astronauts on board.\n\nNASA, which provided live coverage of Wednesday's launch, is expected to provide coverage of the landing as well, which is projected to occur a little over 24 hours after launch.\n\nHere are updates from the launch and what to know about the mission.\n\nA year behind and over budget:Timeline shows Boeing Starliner struggles and scrubs\n\nBoeing announces Starliner is in 'safe, stable' orbit\n\nBoeing Space shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, at 11:44 a.m. confirming the launch.\n\n\"After today's launch at 10:52 a.m. ET, #Starliner has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test,\" the post said. \"NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are on their way to (the) Space Station.\"\n\nIf all goes to plan, Starliner will dock Thursday morning on the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module. Once it reaches the space station, the crew will spend a little over a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.\n\nThe craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nStarliner reaches orbit\n\nAccording to NASA's livestream, the Starliner safely entered orbit around 11:24 a.m.\n\n\"The names of Wilmore and Williams now join Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper as American astronauts to launch into space atop Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral,\" ULA officials said in a blog post.\n\nStarliner orbital insertion burn\n\nAround 11:23 a.m., the Starliner engaged in an orbital insertion burn – a process in which a craft is slowed enough in relation to the velocity of the target body to allow the craft to enter its orbit.\n\nThe burn took Starliner out of its suborbital trajectory and pushed it to an altitude that will allow it to enter proper orbit to catch up with ISS.\n\nThe capsule broke away from the rocket after reaching orbit and began firing its own engines as it powered onward to the International Space Station, NASA said.\n\nBoeing Starliner launches from Florida: 'Let's get going'\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft was perched atop the Atlas V rocket when it launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nIn the moments leading up to the launch, astronaut Wilmore delivered a speech while strapped into his seat on the craft next to fellow astronaut Williams.\n\n\"We saw many American flags and many of you were waving flags at us ... also one on the side of the rocket itself,\" Wilmore said. \"We know that that represents unity and resilience, and unified efforts for the common good. And that's what Suni and I have witnessed this last month.\"\n\n\"Each of you displays what this nation's forefathers envisioned, a people committed to God, family and country, a people who use their gifts and talents for the common good and are passionate and tough. And we all know when the going gets tough, and it often does, the tough get going, and you have. And Suni and I are honored to share this dream of space fight with each and every one of you.\n\n\"So with that, let's get going. Let's put some fire in this rocket, let's push it to the heavens where all these tough Americans are prepared to be.\"\n\nWho is on board the Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts on board the Starliner are Wilmore and Williams, both Navy test pilots who have ventured to space twice before.\n\nWhat happened on past Boeing test flights?\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe follow-up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple concerns as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later, Florida Today reported.\n\nBoeing competes with SpaceX to make low-Earth orbit trips\n\nA successful mission would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecrafts capable of making crewed scientific trips to low-Earth orbit, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it has also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo era. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and carried out a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional in time for Artemis III, slated for sometime in 2026.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the space station. The eighth crew of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

I can hardly wait,” Funk said in an Instagram video posted by Bezos.\n\n“Nothing has ever gotten in my way,\" she added. \"They said, ‘Well, you’re a girl, you can’t do that.’ I said, ’Guess what, doesn’t matter what you are. You can still do it if you want to do it and I like to do things that nobody has ever done.”\n\nIn a cosmic twist, she'll beat the late John Glenn, who set a record at age 77 when flying aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998. Glenn pooh-poohed the idea of women flying in space, shortly after he became the first American to orbit the world in 1962.\n\n“No one has waited longer,” Bezos said via Instagram. “It’s time. Welcome to the crew, Wally.\"\n\nMore:Plenty of elbow room and the largest windows in space: A deeper look at Jeff Bezos' trip to space\n\nThe Amazon founder is stepping down as the company's CEO on Monday.\n\nThe upcoming launch — which follows 15 successful test flights — will open the door to paying customers. Blue Origin has yet to announce ticket prices or when the public might strap into the spacious six-seat capsule, which reaches an altitude of about 65 miles, just beyond the edge of space. The up-and-down flights last 10 minutes.\n\nThe reusable rocket is named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and July 20 is the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nFunk was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and grew up in Taos, according to the Albuquerque Journal. She now lives in Texas.\n\nFunk was the first female inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration and the first female air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. In the posted video, she said she has 19,600 flying hours and has taught more than 3,000 people to fly.\n\nShe was among two dozen female pilots who underwent six days of rigorous physical tests — the same ones administered to the Mercury astronaut candidates — in 1960 and 1961. The doctor who had tested the Mercury 7 men had heard the Soviets planned to send a woman to space and he wanted to see if women could endure the effects of weightlessness.\n\nThe candidates had to spend hours in an isolation water tank, swallow rubber hose, and get needles stuck in their heads, among other things.\n\nMore:Dirty clothes get trashed in space. NASA and Tide are working on a detergent to stop that\n\nThirteen of the women — including Funk — passed. But the program was abruptly canceled, and the Soviets went on to launch the first woman into space — Valentina Tereshkova — in 1963.\n\n“They told me that I had done better and completed the work faster than any of the guys,” Funk recalled. \"So I got hold of NASA four times. I said I want to become an astronaut, but nobody would take me. I didn’t think that I would ever get to go up.”\n\nIt wasn't until 1983 that the first American woman soared into space — Sally Ride, who died in 2012. And it wasn't until 1995 that an American woman piloted a spaceship — Eileen Collins aboard shuttle Discovery. Many of the Mercury 13 women gathered at Cape Canaveral for that launch.\n\nKeen to get to space, Funk reserved a seat years ago on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket ship. She remains on the passenger list; the company plans three more test flights from New Mexico, one of them with Branson on board, before launching customers.\n\nMore:Branson mum on when he’ll launch to space on Virgin Galactic\n\nIn the video, Bezos describes to Funk how the four Blue Origin passengers will experience zero gravity for a few minutes, then land gently on the desert surface and open the hatch.\n\n“You step outside. What’s the first thing you say?” he asked her.\n\n“I will say, 'Honey, that was the best thing that ever happened to me!” Funk replied, embracing Bezos in a big bear hug.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/01"}]}

Charles Moulden, a young black man from Sevier County, was fishing for trout with white friends on the Tellico River near Tellico Plains. He was threatened by a local man who said he’d kill him if he didn’t leave.\n\n\n\n“It never crossed my mind that he’d shoot me,” Moulden says 46 years later.\n\n\n\nBut he did.\n\n\n\nNo outcry followed the attack, just days after the assassination of America’s civil-rights leader. Almost nothing appeared in the newspapers, even after the suspect was acquitted, despite overwhelming evidence. Instead, the incident was ignored and, through the years, faded into the past — until now.\n\n\n\nNews Sentinel columnist Sam Venable had long heard whispers of what happened that day, and this year he determined to find the truth. What he uncovered is a powerful story of hate, courage and, ultimately, healing.\n\nTELLICO PLAINS, Tenn. — Charles Moulden didn’t hear the sound at first. That comes later, he explained; it takes a second or two for your subconscious to process what just happened.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, all he knew was (1) he was face-first in the gravel of a narrow road alongside Tellico River and (2) his left thigh was stinging intensely.\n\n\n\n“It was like a mad hornet on steroids,” Moulden related a few days ago as he strode the same roadway, now paved with asphalt.\n\n\n\n“I thought I must have gotten into some bees. I pushed myself back up on my feet and looked down at my leg. I thought I’d find some kind of huge stinger poking out.”\n\n\n\nAll Moulden saw was a hole in his pants. He squeezed the flesh beneath it. Instead of a stinger, out came a trickle of blood. Immediately, excruciating pain erupted in the back of his leg.\n\n\n\n“That’s when I looked up and saw him again,” Moulden continues, gesturing toward a small rise in the bend of the road up ahead.\n\n\n\n“He had stepped out from behind the bush. His arms were straight down by his side. Then he raised one arm, and I saw the pistol.”\n\n\n\nMoulden makes a circle with his fingertips.\n\n\n\n“Man, the end of that thing looked like it was three inches wide.\n\n\n\n“He aimed directly at me. I shut my eyes and grimaced.”\n\n\n\nThis time, Moulden heard the gun’s report. Forty-six years after the fact, he considers that a good omen:\n\n\n\n“If you hear the ‘pow,’ it means you didn’t get hit. By the time the sound gets there, the bullet is long gone.”\n\n\n\nIt was Wednesday, April 10, 1968, and the news was riveting.\n\nOne day earlier in Atlanta, 150,000 marchers followed a mule-drawn wagon carrying the casket of Martin Luther King Jr. to a service at Morehouse College, shortly after his funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\n\n\nIn Memphis and throughout the U.S., teams of investigators were sorting through tips — some intentionally misleading, as it turned out — in their frantic search for the gunman who had assassinated the civil-rights leader six days earlier.\n\nIn Chattanooga, a curfew was in effect after looting broke out following an MLK memorial service.\n\n\n\nIn the highlands of East Tennessee, however, the mood was a bit more festive, despite gray skies and sporadic showers. It was the long-awaited opening day of trout season.\n\n\n\nMoulden, a 24-year-old brick mason from Sevierville, was among the army of anglers who turned out.\n\n\n\nA few of these sportsmen deployed fly rods and tiny, hand-tied insect imitations in hopes of catching rainbow, brown and brook trout. The vast majority, like Moulden, used spinning equipment and an array of “live bait” — everything from nightcrawlers to doughballs to the ever-popular yellow kernels of canned corn.\n\n\n\nYet there was one major difference between Moulden and the other fishermen. A difference that transcended equipment and tactics. A societal difference that mattered greatly in those not-so-good old days.\n\n\n\nHe was black.\n\n“I’d been fishing all my life,” says Moulden, now 70, an Oak Ridge resident and site superintendent for Summit Contractors in Knoxville. “Douglas Lake, Cherokee Lake, I was all over them. But I never had fished for trout.”\n\n\n\nHe pauses to chuckle and shake his head. “When they told me you could catch trout on corn, I was like, ‘Aw, c’mon!’ But Bill, ‘Arvilee’ and Leroy insisted it worked. They invited me to come along with them that morning.”\n\n\n\nThat would be Bill Williams, Arvil Lee Parton and his son Leroy.\n\n\n\nArvil ran a masonry and concrete-finishing business in Sevier County and often sought Moulden’s skills. Williams and the Partons were white but saw nothing unusual about including a black friend on the trip.\n\n\n\nParticularly if that friend was Charles Moulden — born, raised and widely known by folks of all races throughout Sevier County.\n\n\n\nBy the standards of that era, of course, such mingling ceased at the schoolhouse door.\n\n\n\nMoulden and his five siblings attended the all-black Pleasant View Elementary School in Sevierville. At the ninth grade, their only educational option — and that of most black students throughout the region — was to be driven into Knoxville to the all-black Vine Junior and Austin High schools.\n\nThat changed for Moulden in the fall of 1963, aided and abetted by the fact he was a gifted athlete.\n\n\n\nIn his senior year, he was in the first group of black students to enroll in Sevier County High School. As a quick, muscular Smoky Bears running back, he also was the first black athlete to play football in the old Knoxville Interscholastic League. Moulden was popular with classmates, graduating in 1964 along with a blond bouffant country music singer — another Parton, this one named Dolly.\n\n\n\n“I never really thought anything about going fishing with white guys,” he says.\n\n\n\n“I already had a fishing license, but I went to Carl Owenby’s hardware store in Sevierville to buy a trout stamp. On the way down to Tellico, we stopped somewhere to buy a daily permit. I remember it cost one dollar.”\n\n\n\nMoulden doesn’t recall much else about his inaugural trip into the rugged Monroe County mountains. Not because of mental erosion during the intervening years. He simply never had a chance to see the landscape:\n\n\n\n“Me and one of the other boys rode in the bed of Arvilee’s pickup truck. He had a camper shell on it. It didn’t have any windows, except one in the very back. Arvilee had busted up a couple of bales of straw in there, so me and whoever else it was slept most of the way.\n\n\n\n“It wasn’t until 2010, when I rode with some friends to Tellico Plains on our motorcycles, that I even knew how to get there. I had to look it up on a map.”\n\n\n\nThe foursome attracted some unwanted attention from the start.\n\n\n\n“It was still early, and me and Charlie were walkin’ down the road, goin’ from one pool to another,” says Leroy Parton, now 66, who still lives in Sevierville.\n\n\n\n“This old white man walked up to us. I’ll never forget the look on his face. He had a long, white beard that must have gone to his waist. He looked at us and said, ‘You’re gonna have to git outta these mountains!’\n\n\n\n“He glanced over at me and said: ‘Not you! Him!’ He pointed to Charlie, and then he stomped off.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Charlie, what are you gonna do?’\n\n\n\n“He shrugged, ‘Why, I’m goin’ fishin.’ ”\n\n\n\nEven today, the mood of that unsettling moment is fresh on Leroy Parton’s mind: “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, these people down here must even hate their own mothers!’ ”\n\n\n\nIt took Moulden awhile to get the hang of drifting his bait through moving water instead of casting into the placid environs of a reservoir. Soon enough, though, everything clicked.\n\n“I caught a couple of little ‘cigar’ trout and threw ’em back,” he says. “Then I realized I’d do better if I fished in the slow, deep holes instead of the rapids. I caught four good trout real quick.\n\n\n\n“I had just come up out of the river and was walking down the road to find another place to fish. That’s when he drove up.”\n\n\n\nThe car that approached was a black, early-1950s model Chevrolet, Moulden recalls. It may have had some green paint on the fender or hood. But he has vivid recall of what transpired between him and the driver.\n\n\n\n“He came all the way across the road and brushed my leg with his fender. He revved the engine real loud. Then he started cussing me. It was ‘nigger this’ and ‘nigger that.’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden felt an immediate flush of rage. Instinctively, his fists began to clench. In another place, he might have punched the driver senseless through the car’s open window. But he had the presence of mind to know he was in foreign territory.\n\n\n\n“I could smell alcohol on him, but he wasn’t what you’d call drunk. He knew exactly what he was saying and doing. Finally, he said, ‘Didn’t you see the sign?’\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘What sign is that, sir?’\n\n\n\n“He said, ‘The sign in town that says: ‘Nigger, read and run. Don’t let the sun set with you in this town.’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden was all-too familiar with warnings of “the sign,” real or fictive. He’d heard them all his life. Thus, he adopted a ploy that had often worked in similarly tense situations.\n\n\n\nHe played Stepin Fetchit dumb.\n\n\n\n“I said: ‘No, sir; I didn’t see no sign. I was ridin’ in the back of this here truck when we came through town. Besides, it wouldn’t have done me no good to see it ’cause I can’t read or write.’ ”\n\n“That figures!” spat the angry driver, who then issued an ominous warning before speeding away: “You get outta here! Next time I see you, you’re a dead nigger!”\n\n\n\nMoulden’s friends quickly gathered. Leroy asked again, “What are you gonna do, Charlie?”\n\n\n\n“I’m tellin’ you, I’m goin’ fishin’!” Moulden reiterated, now more determined than ever.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Leroy, if I paid attention every time a white man called me a nigger or threatened me, I’d be too scared to come out of my house.’\n\n\n\n“Oh, I was sensitive to the N-word, all right. I didn’t like it. I knew how to fight. But it’s like my dad had always said to me: ‘Son, you can’t fight ’em all.’\n\n\n\n“I told Leroy: ‘All I can do is hope the Good Lord is riding with me today. That’s the only protection I got. That’s the only protection I need.’ So I went on fishing.”\n\n\n\nAfter a few hours, the party moved several miles upriver to a spot just above the old Tellico Lodge. They found a promising stretch of water. Arvil pulled his truck to the side of the road. Everyone got out.\n\n\n\nAt virtually the same moment, the black Chevrolet flew by.\n\n\n\n“One of the boys said, ‘Charlie, there goes your buddy,’ ” Moulden recalls.\n\n\n\n“He drove on around the bend, and I figured he hadn’t seen me. I saw a nice eddy in the river and started walking up the road to reach it.”\n\n\n\nThat’s when one of his friends uttered four words Moulden will never forget:\n\n\n\n“Charlie, there he is.”\n\n\n\n“I looked up and sure enough, there he stood. He was on a little bit of an incline, trying to hide behind a bush. I could see him plain as day from the waist up.”\n\n\n\nMore than four decades later, Moulden’s eyes bore holes through that same rise in the terrain. He is temporarily silent. The only sound comes from the rushing river nearby. Finally, he speaks.\n\n\n\n“I remember thinking, ‘Well, I wonder what’s he gonna do?’\n\n\n\n“ ‘Is he gonna come out here in the road and we go fist-to-fist?’ That would’ve been fine with me. I was a boxer, and I knew he’d been drinking. I was sure I could take care of myself.\n\n\n\n“Then I thought, ‘Is he gonna throw a rock? Bring a stick?’ The wheels in my mind were just spinning.\n\n\n\n“I knew some people hated me for the color of my skin. Even though they didn’t know me or know what I did or anything, they were just mad at me for my color. Still, it never crossed my mind that he’d shoot me.\n\n\n\n“So I sorta lowered my head and kept walking.”\n\n\n\nOne second, Moulden was striding confidently. The next, his left leg blew backward just as his right leg was coming forward. His body crashed into the roadbed.\n\n\n\n“Ain’t it funny?” he says. “I remember crushing that can of corn as I fell. Corn spewed out all over the road. My fishing pole broke. My knuckles were bloody.”\n\n\n\nHe struggled back to his feet and began looking for that imagined “mad hornet stinger.” The assailant stepped into the road, re-aimed, launched a second (albeit errant) round, pointed the muzzle of his pistol skyward, fired twice more into the air and vanished into the woods. It was over in an eyeblink.\n\n\n\nMoulden tried to walk, but his legs betrayed him. He fell again and began crawling toward the only cover available: a steep bank to his left.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t know if maybe he was coming back around to shoot me from above,” Moulden recalls. “I just remember lying on my back and looking up through the trees, trying to find him.”\n\n\n\nAt that very moment, the heads of two young boys popped up from the river. Moulden shouted for them to get down. They vanished, only to reappear and run by him seconds later.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think they had anything to do with the shooting,” he says. “Maybe they were upriver somewhere, fishing with their dad. That’s the last I ever saw of them.\n\n\n\n“My buddies had taken cover. They were hollering: ‘Charlie! Charlie! Did he just shoot you?’\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Yeah!’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden gathers himself once again as the shocking event replays in his mind. He chooses his words deliberately, every syllable punctuated by the anger and pain he felt that day:\n\n\n\n“I yelled real loud back over my head, toward the woods: ‘Yeah, that SON OF A BITCH just shot me!’ ”\n\n\n\nHe adds in retrospect: “I guess that wasn’t the smartest thing to say, knowin’ he was probably right above me. But honestly, I was hurtin’ so bad by then, I didn’t care if he came back around and killed me.”\n\n\n\nThe next few minutes are a blur.\n\n\n\nMoulden’s friends were afraid to come to his aid for fear the shooter was perched above. Waiting. Pistol cocked. Aiming. Who knew?\n\n\n\nSummoning what was left of his strength, Moulden crawled back across the road and down to the parked truck. He opened the passenger door, pulled himself into the floorboard and pushed the clutch pedal with one hand. The truck rolled rearward a few feet.\n\n\n\n“They kept telling me how to cut the steering wheel,” he says. “I’d turn the wheel and push the clutch and move closer to them.”\n\n\n\nEventually the distance closed enough for his friends to sprint from hiding.\n\n\n\n“Arvilee climbed over me and got hold of my belt,” Moulden says. “He pulled me inside. The others jumped into the bed. Arvilee cranked the engine and sped around the curve.”\n\n\n\nAbout that time “a government man” pulled up in his car. Moulden doesn’t know if it was a game warden or a Forest Service worker. He does know the man wasn’t armed.\n\n\n\n“My buddies kept yelling, ‘Give us your gun!’ The guy kept saying, ‘I ain’t got one!’ But at least he called an ambulance.”\n\n\n\nFor all the good that would do.\n\nAs soon as the situation was explained and radioed to civilization, rescue workers said no way were they coming into the national forest to pick up a black man who’d been shot by a white man — especially one who might still be hidden, poised to attack again.\n\n\n\n“They had to drive me down to Tellico Plains (a distance of 18 miles),” says Moulden. “Once they got me loaded into the ambulance, the rest of the boys took off for Sevierville.\n\n\n\n“I was riding along in that ambulance, begging them to give me a shot for pain. Nobody would. I finally asked where we were going. The only hospitals I knew were Baptist and UT.\n\n\n\n“The driver said, ‘We’re going to Blount Memorial.’ I asked, ‘Where’s that?’\n\n\n\n“ ‘Maryville,’ he said.”\n\nMoulden can’t help but laugh at his memory of that moment, terrifying as it was.\n\n\n\n“Maryville was 10,” he says, referring to the numeral 10 on Blount County license plates back in the day.\n\n\n\n“Ten was where the Klan was! I used to see ‘10’ on cars whenever there was a cross-burning. I kept thinking: ‘Oh, Lord! I’m out of the frying pan and into the oven!’ ”\n\n\n\nHappily, no ill will came Moulden’s way at Blount Memorial. “They treated me real nice,” he says.\n\n\n\nHe remained hospitalized five days and was discharged on crutches. The bullet was still embedded in his thigh.\n\n\n\nIt still is.\n\n“The doctors told me it had fragmented into at least six pieces,” he says. “They said they’d have to do a lot more damage to the muscles in my leg than the bullet itself. Those pieces cut me. They hurt me for a long time. Sometimes they still do.”\n\n\n\nMoulden was married with one daughter. He couldn’t work. His wife applied for welfare.\n\n“I hated that,” he says. “I’d never been on welfare.\n\n\n\n“After I could finally get up and move around on crutches, I asked Arvilee for some work, any work. I said I’d even hose out the wheelbarrows, whatever I could do to make some money. He had just gotten the job to pour the foundation for a motel between Pigeon and Gatlinburg, so he hired me.\n\n\n\n“I taped a board to my leg. That way, I could get down on one knee and stick that leg out. I was able to start finishing concrete again.\n\n\n\n“The going wage back then was $16-$18 a day. At the end of the first week, Arvilee paid me $20 a day. I told him he didn’t have to do that, but he said I was out-working everybody else on the crew.”\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Moulden was hired at K-25 in Oak Ridge. He stayed at the government facility until it closed 14 years later. He worked a variety of masonry jobs after that, even had his own construction company for a while.\n\n\n\nHe retired at age 66, only to be subsequently hired by Summit. The crews he supervises have built more than 75 Dollar Tree stores all over the United States.\n\n\n\n“The first thing I did after Arvilee paid me was to go downtown and get off welfare,” he said. “Bullet or no bullet, I wasn’t gonna be on no welfare.”\n\nMADISONVILLE, Tenn. — If there were any doubts in Charles Moulden’s mind about prejudicial feelings, they were settled the morning of Sept. 4, 1968, as he limped into the Monroe County Courthouse on crutches.\n\n\n\n“When I came in, there was this white lady standing in the hall,” Moulden recalls. “I smiled and said howdy to her, how are you doing?\n\n\n\n“She said: ‘I’d be doin’ a lot better if you wasn’t here. We don’t want no niggers down here. He shoulda killed you.’\n\n\n\n“I told her, ‘Well, he didn’t.’ I wasn’t smiling by then.”\n\n\n\nOut on the courthouse lawn, rib-poking good ol’ boy commentary was even more blunt, more biting.\n\n\n\nMoulden still has a vivid memory of those humiliating statements:\n\n\n\n“Some of ’em were saying stuff like, ‘You know Fred didn’t shoot at that nigger. Fred’s a better shot than that. If he’d shot at that nigger, he would’ve killed him.’ Then they’d laugh.”\n\n\n\nLittle wonder, then, why the jury reached a quick verdict.\n\n\n\nTestimony in the case lasted a little more than half the day. In just under a half-hour — 3:25 p.m. until 3:50 p.m. — the all-male, all-white panel came to a unanimous decision:\n\n\n\n“Not guilty, your honor.”\n\nForty-five-year-old Fred William Ellis — a previously convicted killer already infamous in the East Tennessee backcountry for frequent brushes with the law — was free to go.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Judge James C. Witt dismissed all charges and sent a smug and smiling Ellis on his way.\n\n\n\n“Ellis was always acting nonchalant (on the stand),” said Moulden. “My attention was on him all the time. Whenever he looked at me, I could see the anger in his eyes.\n\n\n\n“I will tell you this: I tried to make as much eye contact as possible, just to make him mad. I thought, ‘Surely they won’t let him shoot me here.’ ”\n\n\n\nBy one measure, Moulden says today, he was surprised by the decision.\n\n\n\nBy another, it was nauseatingly predictable.\n\n\n\nCase number 3030 appeared airtight. The state had four eyewitnesses on its side.\n\n\n\nThere was 24-year-old Moulden, the victim who was black, along with his three white fishing buddies: Bill Williams, Arvil Lee Parton and Leroy Parton, all from Sevierville.\n\n\n\nOn April 10, Williams and the Partons had watched and listened as Ellis, a lifelong resident of the nearby Coker Creek community, cursed and angrily threatened their friend on opening day of trout season in the Cherokee National Forest. Later that same day, they had seen Ellis’ car roar past their fishing party and then Ellis appear seconds later in a bend of the road ahead.\n\n\n\nAgreed, only Moulden — cut down as the first shot was fired — had actually watched the assailant re-aim his pistol and squeeze off a second round. By then, the three others had ducked for cover.\n\n\n\nStill, it was pretty strong evidence, especially considering that an intoxicated Ellis had been arrested at Tellico Lodge shortly after the assault occurred. He was charged with attempted murder and jailed under a $5,000 bond.\n\nOfficers believed Ellis sprinted up the ridge from the site of the shooting, hid his gun, dropped into a low gap and emerged where Bill White’s rustic hunting and fishing resort was located.\n\n\n\nIt’s a quite plausible theory. Anyone familiar with these hills and hollows could eclipse the distance in a matter of minutes.\n\n“Right before the trial started, the sheriff had us walk through the courtroom, one at a time, and look around,” said Moulden. “Then he had us walk out through another door and describe what the shooter looked like.\n\n\n\n“All four of us identified Fred Ellis. I thought this was going to be a slam-dunk.”\n\n\n\nIt was a slam-dunk all right. Just 180 degrees in the other direction. Which underscores why Moulden wasn’t surprised by the outcome.\n\n\n\n“The whole thing was a farce, a dog and pony show,” he said.\n\n\n\nLeroy Parton, 66, who still lives in Sevierville, remains as bitter in 2014 as he was in 1968 when the not-guilty verdict was announced.\n\n\n\n“They should’ve hung that son of a bitch,” he said. “Instead, they let him go free.”\n\n\n\nVeteran criminal court reporter Jack Harrill recorded the spellbinding testimony on Edison Voicewriter vinyl discs — cutting-edge technology in its era but audio antiques today.\n\n\n\n“That jury wasn’t going to convict Fred Ellis of anything,” he said grimly.\n\n\n\nCharles Moulden: Court testimony\n\n\n\nMoulden concurs:\n\n\n\n“It was either because I was black or all of us were outsiders from Sevier County. Or maybe everybody was afraid to testify against him. It didn’t matter.”\n\n\n\nJust how poisonous was this atmosphere?\n\n\n\nThe Sevier Countians received so many threats, veiled and direct, they had to be driven to the courthouse by deputy escort.\n\n\n\nThe defense, led by Knoxville attorney Calvin N. Taylor, planted seeds of doubt in the jury’s mind at every turn. Such as:\n\n\n\nHow could Moulden and the Partons distinguish Ellis’ black 1952 Chevrolet from other possible black 1952 Chevrolets on the road that day?\n\n\n\nHow could they identify Ellis from 50-75 yards away and yet not be able to describe the kind of gun he used?\n\n\n\nHad it not been foggy?\n\n\n\nWas there not enough emergent vegetation to obscure the shooter?\n\n\n\nWho knows if “this colored boy” was even telling the truth about being shot? Why was there no doctor to testify about the extent of his injuries?\n\n\n\nEllis himself took the stand and repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nHe swore he didn’t own a pistol. He insisted he had only pulled his car off the road to consume “a half-pint of bonded whiskey some feller give me up on North River.” He said he ran into the woods in fear for his own life when he heard shots being fired down the road.\n\n\n\nAttorney General Tom J. Taylor of Cleveland re-examined often, allowing the victim and his friends to reiterate their eyewitness versions.\n\n\n\nIt was during his closing argument to the jury, though, that the prosecutor cut to the chase.\n\n\n\n“You gentlemen are not stupid,” his voice can be heard on the scratchy recordings, recently found in the Monroe County Courthouse’s archives.\n\n\n\n“You know what happened. You know what this case is really about.\n\n“I don’t know how you feel about mixing colored and white,” Taylor continued, his voice rising with emotion. “But if you are so prejudiced (as to turn Ellis free), you might just as well put a badge on him and let him go back to terrorizing whoever he wants!”\n\n\n\n“What if it had been your own (son) who’d been shot?” he pleaded with the panel. “How would you feel then?”\n\n\n\nThe attorney general’s final sentence to the jury, delivered in the politically correct jargon of the day, reverberated through the courtroom like a fire-and-brimstone sermon:\n\n\n\n“You might let (Ellis) go free because he ‘just shot a Negra,’ but I tell you, it might not be a Negra next time!”\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\n\n\nAlthough originally accused of attempted murder, Ellis was ultimately tried for felonious assault. On May 6, 1968, the Monroe County grand jury had returned a true bill on that charge.\n\n\n\nHis first trial was held May 24. The outcome was a hung jury.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 4, as soon as the second jury announced its not-guilty verdict, Moulden saw no further use trying to beat the system.\n\n\n\n“The attorney general told me it was my duty to come back and we’d fight this thing in federal court,” Moulden remembered.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘No, sir. I’ve had enough. I wasn’t comin’ back no more. The only way I’d do that was if they gave Fred Ellis a fishing pole and me a pistol.\n\n\n\n“I told him, ‘These people want this man down here more than they want me down here. A person with no more intelligence than that, he’ll probably never leave this area.\n\n\n\n“Besides, my friends had a concrete-finishing business in Sevierville. They were losing money every time we came to Madisonville. I couldn’t ask them to keep doing that.”\n\n\n\nMoulden’s final message to the prosecutor proved hauntingly prophetic:\n\n\n\n“Now you’ve got to contend with him. Who’s he gonna shoot next? He’s already showed he doesn’t mind pulling the trigger on another human being.”\n\n\n\nEllis belonged to a hillbilly family with a reputation for “law-bending” — mostly hunting and fishing violations, as well as making and drinking moonshine.\n\n\n\n“I never personally arrested Fred,” said former Monroe County Sheriff Frank White, 82, who still works as a courthouse officer when his health permits. “But it seems like my deputies were picking him up all the time, mostly for drinking. I remember he could really aggravate you.”\n\n\n\nBy all accounts, the clan’s patriarch, Ben Ellis, was a soft-spoken mountain man who supplemented his meager farm income as a bear-and-boar hunting guide — “in season or out,” the late News Sentinel staff writer Willard Yarbrough once quipped in print.\n\n\n\nAs Ben’s sons came of age, however, they turned to violence.\n\n\n\nTwo of them, Ed and Benton, died in separate outbreaks of gunfire. A third, Roy, was wounded in another shootout. Roy died at age 75 in 2008, although it is not clear whether those injuries contributed to his death.\n\n\n\nBy far, Ed Ellis’ death attracted the greatest media attention. He was a major player in a 20th-century, East Tennessee version of the Hatfields and McCoys.\n\n\n\nTrouble began brewing when another Coker Creek native, Korean War veteran Myles Witt, returned to Monroe County and started a construction business. Witt hoped to develop some of the region into vacation homes and retreats. He attracted outside investors, formed the Unicoi Mountain Corp. and set up operations.\n\n\n\nAnger, jealousy, confrontation and retribution — “mountain justice” in local parlance — quickly followed.\n\n\n\nThe common denominator was a clear liquid dispensed in Mason jars.\n\n\n\nThe licensed making of corn liquor became legal in Tennessee in 2009; it has blossomed into a lucrative tourist attraction. But for two centuries prior, this art was practiced on the sly throughout these rough, misty highlands.\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s, the notion that flatlanders might start prowling around where stills were located — let alone take up residence — was a recipe for disaster. Here’s what Yarbrough wrote about the situation in an analysis from Sept. 8, 1974:\n\n\n\n“The Ellis and Witt clans have been involved in court actions for the past 21/2 years, both civil and criminal — ranging from allegations of cabin burnings and shooting into buildings owned by the Witt interests, damage suits and earlier bloodshed.\n\n\n\n“The saga is complex,” Yarbrough noted, “but it involves moonshining and little law enforcement, which at times is non-existent.”\n\n\n\nThe conflict smouldered back and forth before exploding savagely. On Aug. 17, 1974, Ed Ellis was killed in a rural road shootout with Myles Witt and two of his associates.\n\n\n\nWitt and his men were charged with murder. Three trials resulted in hung juries. Prosecutors pushed for a fourth. But in November 1978, the Tennessee Supreme Court ordered all charges dismissed because “the probability of any future jury reaching a verdict of guilt or innocence is almost non-existent.”\n\n\n\nThe death of Benton (“Babe”) Ellis was even more grisly and mysterious.\n\n\n\nOn April 13, 1988, his body was found in the woods about one mile from his house. He had been struck at close range by a shotgun blast to the back of his head.\n\n\n\nMonths passed with no arrest, prompting investigators to attempt loosening lips another way.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 5, 1988, the News Sentinel reported that a $2,500 state reward had been posted for information about the killing.\n\n\n\nStill nothing. Money may be an effective lubricant for solving crime in some settings. Not here.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t until 1997 that a suspect was brought into custody. He was a Kentuckian, Roy E. Browder.\n\n\n\nHe also was Babe Ellis’ nephew.\n\n\n\nBrowder’s trial was postponed several times. Finally, on April 19, 1999, he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was paroled on Christmas Eve of that year and returned to Kentucky on probation.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s, long before the Moulden case, Fred Ellis had served 17 months in North Carolina for voluntary manslaughter. A decade later, he continued to be implicated as the Monroe County feuding, arson and gun battles raged.\n\n\n\nIn 1977, he received a two-to-five-year prison sentence on attempted murder charges — this time involving a shootout with Myles Witt and his wife, Dixie — but was granted probation after serving 60 days. During that same era, he racked up a litany of other arrests, everything from public drunkenness to attempted jailbreak.\n\n\n\nMany longtime employees of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency also recall a brief — albeit terrifying — standoff near Waucheesi Lookout between the Ellises and the late game warden John French.\n\n\n\n“The way I heard the story,” says retired wildlife biologist Dick Conley, “the boys had been drinking when John stopped them. One of ’em got out of the truck and started to point a shotgun at him. John grabbed his own pistol and stuck it in one of Ellis boy’s ears and hollered, ‘If you mother------s shoot me, I’ll shoot him!’ Everybody backed off pretty quick, but it rattled John to the day he died.”\n\n\n\nIronically, on Sept. 4, 1969 — one year to the day after Fred Ellis was declared not guilty in the shooting of trout fisherman Charles Moulden — he was found guilty of possessing moonshine and fined $10 and court costs, a total of $69.85.\n\n\n\nDespite his lengthy association with violence, Fred Ellis did not die at the end of a gun. He passed away Oct. 3, 1986, at Athens Community Hospital.\n\n\n\nSome say due to heart attack, others cancer. The Tennessee Department of Public Health would not release the cause listed on his death certificate.\n\nAt any rate, he appears to have been a very old man at the relatively young age of 62.\n\n\n\nMoulden has paradoxical feelings about the person he believes wounded him that spring day nearly half a century ago.\n\n\n\n“Don’t get me wrong. It took me well over a year to get rid of my worst anger,” he says.\n\n\n\n“I was one mad man. I kept saying to myself and my friends, ‘That’s fine if he stays down there in Monroe County. But if I ever catch him in Sevier County, I’ll plant him.’ ”\n\n\n\nThe years have softened his attitude and refocused his perspective.\n\n\n\n“Fred was a product of his environment, his culture and the times,” said Moulden. “That’s just the way it was. I’m sure he was saying (in court) what his lawyer told him to say.\n\n\n\n“Of course, he was a coward who hid behind a gun. I would have been happy to fist-fight him, man to man. But I do have a strange kind of respect for him. He told me to my face how he felt about me and what he was going to do to me. I was just young enough and dumb enough to believe it never would actually happen.”\n\n\n\nAt this point, Moulden can’t help but inject some gallows humor: “You know, Fred was a pretty good shot, wasn’t he!\n\n\n\n“When I went down, he probably thought he’d killed me. It was 50-75 yards between us. Maybe he had aimed for my chest and the bullet dropped and hit me in the leg.\n\n\n\n“I’m just glad he missed the second shot.”\n\n\n\nRacial prejudice still exists today, Moulden acknowledges. Instead of being expressed openly, though, bitter feelings often are veiled.\n\n\n\n“What’s worse?” he asked, “for somebody to come right out and say they hate you for the color of your skin? Or to smile at you and be polite and then say bad things as soon as you turn your back?”\n\n\n\nIf given the chance, what would Moulden say in 2014, not only to his attacker but the jurors who set him free?\n\n\n\nHe thought for a moment. Sighed deeply. His gray-bearded face finally settled on a resolute countenance:\n\n\n\n“If they were willing to shake my hand and say they were sorry, I’d shake theirs. If the Good Lord can forgive them, surely I can, too.”\n\n\n\nWhat’s his opinion of the current social and political climate sweeping America, a stance that advocates carrying concealed weapons and stand-your-ground resistance?\n\n\n\n“I certainly understand it,” he answered, “and I suppose if anybody oughta be carrying a gun, it’s me. But I don’t.\n\n\n\n“Think about it: Nobody announces he’s going to shoot you.\n\n\n\n“They didn’t at that movie theater in Colorado or at that school in Connecticut. They just started shooting, the same way I got ambushed. By that time, it’s too late to reach for your gun.”\n\n\n\nThen Moulden was asked what he would have done if he had had a gun that day.\n\n\n\n“Hmmph,” he responded, a grim smile on his lips. “You know the answer as well as I do.\n\n\n\n“In 1968, it wouldn’t have mattered if Fred Ellis had put six holes in me and I only returned one shot in his general direction. A black guy shootin’ at a white man back then?”\n\n\n\nHe shakes his head wistfully.\n\n\n\n“They would’ve strung me up to the nearest tree.”\n\nMADISONVILLE — A stroll around the Monroe County Courthouse speaks volumes about the past.\n\n\n\nAt all four corners of the lawn, as well as on street-side utility poles, there are memorials to soldiers from this area who died in service to their country.\n\n\n\nThe street banners, complete with color photos and pertinent personal information, honor men who have fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThose who perished in the Korean and Vietnam wars are listed alphabetically, including the date of their death.\n\n\n\nSomething stark, however, stands out on the memorials from World Wars I and II.\n\n\n\nThe warriors commemorated here are separated. On each granite face, there’s a long, main list. Then a smaller one beneath.\n\n\n\nUnder “colored.”\n\n\n\nSuch an observation should not be construed as New Age, politically correct judgment of Monroe County. Nor of small towns throughout America, particularly in the South, that continue to divide the memory of military service in this manner.\n\n\n\nThis practice is understandable. It is accurate. It is historical fact.\n\n\n\nU.S. armed forces were segregated during those wars. So were many of the societies whence these brave men lived, worked, raised families, were drafted or volunteered their last measure.\n\nThey grew up separately, served separately, died separately, are memorialized separately.\n\n\n\nSome communities have erased these old lines by posting new plaques that combine the victims into a single group. Some communities have not chosen to do so. To each its own.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, it does strike the casual visitor ironic that at this very courthouse, race — not damning testimony — determined the outcome of a long-whispered-about criminal trial.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 4, 1968, jurors decreed a local white man not guilty of felonious assault in a heinous, cowardly attack. In so doing, they disregarded the testimony of law enforcement officers and four eyewitnesses.\n\n\n\nEyewitnesses who were “not from around here.” Including the victim, who happened to be “negro,” in the language of the day.\n\n\n\nLife is neither fair nor perfect. It won’t ever be. Here or anywhere else.\n\n\n\nBut, locals say, if nothing else positive came out of the trial of Fred Ellis, accused in the shooting of Charles Moulden, it did spark a social awakening.\n\n\n\n“Nobody is proud of that trial,” says 89-year-old Charles Hall, revered businessman and historian who served 16 terms as mayor of Tellico Plains until stepping down from office in 1990.\n\n\n\n“Attitudes have changed immensely since then. Tellico Plains has made a lot of progress. So have communities all around here.”\n\n\n\nHall recalled a high school basketball game, not long after the trial, pitting Tellico Plains against a Knoxville team with a lone black player.\n\n\n\n“I met with our boys before the game and said, ‘There aren’t going to be any problems, are there?’\n\n\n\n“They assured me no. And there weren’t. They just played basketball.”\n\n\n\nMarty Cook, longtime Monroe County Circuit Court clerk, says she was in high school when Jim Crow-era restrictions fell by the way.\n\n\n\n“I don’t remember it being a big deal for any of us students,” she said. “If there were any concerns, it was among a few adults. Everybody else got along. They still do.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, I remember those times,” says Monroe County sheriff Bill Bivens, “but I can assure you it’s not like that now. It’s changed a lot.”\n\n\n\nA black deputy, Chris Francis, serves on Bivens’ staff.\n\n\n\n“Chris is as fine an officer as you’ll find,” said the sheriff. “He came here from the Sweetwater Police Department. He has great respect in this community.\n\n\n\n“I’ve also had a couple of black female deputies. One retired, and one moved on to another job.”\n\n\n\n“I came to Tellico Plains in 1968,” said Pennsylvania native Dick Conley, a retired biologist for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency who now lives in Madisonville.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take Conley long to realize he had moved into a hotbed of bigotry: “Honest to gosh, I thought I’d stepped back in time.\n\n\n\n“But it’s not that way now,” he emphasized. “Things certainly have changed for the better.”\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, Conley cited Leon Tillman, who serves Blount and Monroe counties as a representative for the USDA’s National Resource Conservation Service.\n\n\n\nTillman, who is black, frequently calls on farmers and timberland owners deep in the wilderness. This is the same remote territory where his skin color would have invited inevitable trouble in years gone by.\n\n\n\n“One time I asked Leon if he wanted me to ride with him on some of those calls,” Conley says with a laugh.\n\n\n\n“He shrugged it off. He didn’t need any help. It was sort of like, ‘Why?’ He’d never had a problem.”\n\n\n\nFifty-six-year old Monroe County Mayor Tim Yates recalled “a few” racially charged incidents from his teenage years.\n\n\n\n“It’s sad things used to be like that,” he said. “It’s sad the way the Indians were treated long before that, too.\n\n\n\n“But that’s in our past. It’s history. I hope that’s where it stays.”\n\n\n\nAll of which brings the casual visitor back to those courthouse monuments. Specifically, the one memorializing veterans of the Civil War.\n\nNo individual names are listed here. Just the battalions, regiments and companies to which they belonged.\n\n\n\nIt is not lost on the observer that a single stone now blends these combatants from opposite sides of a bitter, four-year campaign dividing the nation.\n\n\n\nThey are divided no more.\n\n\n\nOne sculpted side of the monument reads: “Monroe County Confederate.” A few inches away, the script says: “Monroe County Federal.”\n\nThis stone was erected in 2004, a full 139 years after hostilities ceased.\n\n\n\nWho knows?\n\n\n\nPerhaps after sufficient time, all of the Monroe County soldiers who lost their lives in World Wars I and II finally will be memorialized as one.\n\nMore:Coverage of Monroe County shooting barely made a sound in 1968\n\nMore:Getting in the game: How one man became first black player on team\n\nMore:Sam Venable column: A story finally told — this one's for Big Sam\n\nMore:A Series on fragments of hate: Prejudice and healing in East Tennessee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2023/01/27/25-best-romantic-restaurants-jacksonville-florida-beaches-valentines-day-anniversary-dinner/69834527007/", "title": "25 best romantic restaurants in Jacksonville, Florida and the beaches", "text": "Whether you're celebrating Valentine’s Day or a 10th anniversary – or perhaps even just a first date – Jacksonville has plenty of restaurants perfect for your special night.\n\nFrom rooftops to waterfronts to suburban strip shopping centers, here are some of our favorite restaurants for a romantic dinner for two on Feb. 14 or any of the other 364 days of the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/27"}]}

The American automaker has a 50% stake in Ford (F) Sollers, a joint venture that employs at least 4,000 workers and is shared with Russian company Sollers.\n\nA Ford dealership and service center. Artyom Geodakyan/TASS/Getty Images\n\nThe company has plants in St. Petersburg, Elabuga and Naberezhnye Chelny but said it had “significantly wound down” its Russian operations in recent years. The automaker said it was “deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine,” and noted it has “a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working at Ford around the world.”\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) said it was halting all exports to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nGM doesn’t have a significant presence there: It sells only about 3,000 vehicles a year through 16 dealerships, according to a spokesperson. That’s out of the more than 6 million vehicles the Detroit-based automaker sells annually.\n\nToyota announced it would stop making cars in Russia or importing them to the country “until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions.”\n\nVolkswagen (VLKAF) is stopping production of vehicles in Russia and has suspended exports to the Russian market. The decision applies to the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nNissan (NSANF) has suspended the export of vehicles to Russia, adding that it “anticipates that production will stop soon at our plant in St. Petersburg.”\n\nAviation\n\nBoeing (BA) said it would suspend support for Russian airlines.\n\nA company spokesperson confirmed the aircraft maker was pausing “parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,” and had also “suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv.”\n\nAirbus (EADSF) followed Boeing with a similar move. In a statement, the company said it has “suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country.”\n\nBig Tech\n\nAirbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that his company was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)’s cloud division, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, said March 8 it would halt new sign-ups for the service in Russia and Belarus.

There is no other public information available and we will have no further comment.\"\n\nThe FBI’s involvement in the Baltimore bridge collapse was expected as the bureau has the lead for terrorism investigations, according to a senior government official. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, characterized the FBI’s work on the Dali as standard operating procedure.\n\nIn the hours after the crash, terrorism was quickly deemed unlikely by government officials who focused on the loss of power aboard the ship as the likely cause for the accident. However, the FBI is the agency that makes the final determination on terrorism and will thoroughly investigate the possibility, the official said.\n\nAccidents involving ships generally are conducted by the Coast Guard, and, at times, the National Transportation Safety Board, the official said. Both agencies have been involved since the early days of the investigation. Given the overlapping concerns in Baltimore about possible criminal negligence, a foreign-flagged vessel in U.S. territorial waters, and at least the possibility of terrorism, several agencies will be involved in a joint investigation.\n\nSome agencies will likely drop out when investigation of their concern is completed, the official said.\n\nThe investigation will also focus on the events leading up to the collapse and whether federal laws and regulations were followed, an anonymous source told the Associated Press.\n\nA different source not authorized to comment publicly told the AP that the Dali experienced apparent electrical problems hours before ever leaving port. Video of the collision with the bridge shows the ship's lights cutting out in the moments before, but the source told AP that alarms had also gone off with some of its refrigerated containers while at the dock, signaling issues with the power supply.\n\nErek L. Barron, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY, “My office generally will not confirm the existence of or otherwise comment about investigations. However, the public should know, whether it’s gun violence, civil rights abuse, financial fraud, or any other threat to public safety or property, we will seek accountability for anyone who may be responsible.”\n\nOn the same day the FBI personnel boarded the ship, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced the city's plans to take legal action against the owner, charterer, manager and the manufacturer of the Dali, \"as well as any other potentially liable third parties,\" according to a press release.\n\nThe announcement comes after Grace Ocean Private Limited, the ship's owner, and Synergy Marine Private Limited, its manager, filed a petition in Maryland District Court earlier this month in a preemptive attempt to exonerate the two companies from any claims or damage costs they incur above $43 million as a result of the disaster.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything in our power to support everyone impacted here and will continue to recognize the human impact this event has had,\" Scott said. \"Part of that work needs to be seeking recourse from those who may potentially be responsible, and with the ship’s owner filing a petition to limit its liability mere days after the incident, we need to act equally as quickly to protect the City’s interests.”\n\nAdam Levitt, the co-founder of DiCello Levitt, a trial firm representing the city, said the city's attorneys would bring \"significant economic and environmental loss claims\" against the owner, manager and others \"to hold them accountable for causing one of the largest inner-city maritime disasters in U.S. history.\"\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, told USA TODAY in an email, \"We again extend our deepest sympathy to all those impacted by this incident. Due to the magnitude of the incident, there are various government agencies conducting investigations, in which we are fully participating. Out of respect for these investigations and any future legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board told Congress that it interviewed personnel on the cargo ship as part of its own investigation into the crash.\n\nThe 984-foot-long ship collided with a support column of the bridge just after 1:20 a.m. on March 26, plunging the structure into the depths of the Patapsco River, along with eight workers who were repairing potholes on the roadway. Two workers were rescued, but six were pronounced dead.\n\nOfficials working on the collapse site recovered the body of Maynor Yasir Suazo-Sandoval, 38, on April 5. The bodies of two other victims, Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, 26, and Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, were discovered in a red pickup truck submerged 25 feet deep in the channel.\n\nAuthorities have not recovered the bodies of the three remaining victims, Miguel Luna, Jose Lopez and Carlos Hernández.\n\nMoore told reporters after the incident that the ship was traveling at a \"very rapid speed\" when it issued a \"Mayday\" distress signal shortly before it collided with the bridge.\n\nA pilot and special navigator, along with a crew of 21 people, were on board the ship at the time of the disaster.\n\nAn unclassified Department of Homeland Security report stated that the ship's crew notified officials at the Maryland Department of Transportation that they had lost control of the vessel and that a collision with the bridge was \"possible.\"\n\nThe ship's pilot also sent a VHF radio call requesting the assistance of nearby tugboats when the ship's power began to falter.\n\nMore:Pittsburgh barges break loose in Ohio River, damage marina\n\nCleanup continues\n\nThe Dali's crews remain about the vessel as cleanup is underway on the ship. As of last week, Maryland reported 136 other foreign nationals are aboard seven other ships in the port of Baltimore.\n\nMaryland officials put the estimated weight of the collapsed steel and road debris at an estimated 27,000 tons, or 54 million pounds. In addition to the bridge debris, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland Butler Jr. has said there’s at least one larger sized vehicle “completely encapsulated” by the bridge’s superstructure underwater.\n\nPartners in a joint response team being steered by the Coast Guard have stated they are monitoring and testing for any potential spills or contamination from the Dali and its cargo, but have detected no threat to the public.\n\nCrews are still working to unload cargo containers from the Dali, which still sits in the water where it collided with the bridge.\n\nOf the 4,700 cargo containers on board the ship when it crashed, 56 carry 764 tons of material classified as \"hazardous,\" including soaps, perfumes, mineral oil, corrosives and lithium ion batteries, according to the Coast Guard and NTSB. The bridge's collapse already damaged 14 of the containers carrying hazardous material, posing the risk of a fuel leak or other hazardous material during the removal efforts.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, a total of 39 cargo containers have been moved from the Dali to a barge to create a safety zone aboard the ship as workers continue to remove the bridge wreckage and debris on the bow, Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Himes said.\n\nThe Coast Guard and others established a 2,400-foot containment boom around the Dali in the days immediately after the bridge collapse, in an effort to prevent any pollution from the ship or its cargo from spreading into the surrounding waterway.\n\nA sheen initially reported in the water around the Dali may be from a bow thruster on the front of the ship that “normally allows it to turn to port or starboard” as it’s approaching the dock, according to Coast Guard Rear Adm. Shannon Gilreath. “We think there were roughly 80 liters of oil in that area,” Gilreath said, but it’s “too dangerous” to reach, given the cargos and bridge structure hanging off the front and sides of the ship.\n\nIn addition to the risks of a leak of fuel or other hazardous material, workers are also grappling with concerns about gas escaping from soybeans fermenting on the ship.\n\nThe Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported in a press briefing last week that crews bagging fermented soybeans from containers on board to remove them had about 50 tons to unload.\n\n“The previous concerns of hazardous gasses from fermenting soybeans cargo is nearly addressed,” the department reported.\n\nOn Sunday, Himes, responding on behalf of the joint information center for the Dali response, confirmed that the workers' efforts to remove the soybeans were nearly complete.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

The organization has researched documented cases of racial lynchings in the county dating back to the 1880s. Members propose placing a monument in downtown Linn Park, which is home to a Confederate memorial that city leaders want removed. The monument would be a local version of the national lynching memorial in Montgomery, which honors about 4,000 people who were lynched nationwide. The national site includes steel slabs that can be obtained by groups or governments for local monuments. A news release says descendants of lynching victims are involved in the Birmingham project.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s Head Start early childhood education program is preparing to close pre-K classrooms and cut jobs due to budget vetoes. The Anchorage Daily News reports the program has lost its $6.8 million in state funding, which is used to unlock federal funds. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy last month vetoed line items equaling $444 million in cuts to the state operating budget. The federal program is Alaska’s largest provider of early childhood services, offering free pre-K, meals, medical care and other services to low-income children up to age 5. Alaska Head Start officials say they’re trying to quickly cut spending and take other measures before the school year begins. Officials say they hope legislators reverse the budget veto to the program.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: After confusion and outrage over Tempe Police Department’s new “positive ticketing” campaign, police officials promise no one will be pulled over for following the law. The department started an initiative Monday called the “Positive Ticketing Campaign.” KPNX initially reported officers would pull over and issue Circle K drink coupons to people following traffic laws. The social media response was swift and critical. Several hours later, Tempe police spokesman Greg Bacon clarified that officers won’t actually be pulling anyone over. He said a school resource officer may give a helmet-wearing, bike-riding student a coupon if they see the student around campus, or a patrol officer might hand a coupon to someone in line at an eatery if they saw them properly yield to a pedestrian. “No one is under any obligation to have a conversation with a police officer,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding $10.5 million to help pay for improvements to a rail line corridor in southern Arkansas. The funding was announced by members of Arkansas’ congressional delegation. The project calls for improvements along the freight corridor, which runs from McGehee, Arkansas, to Tallulah, Louisiana. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the project aims to provide faster and more affordable shipment for crops, fertilizers and other materials. Supporters say repairing the train tracks will create more business opportunities in Mississippi River Delta communities in Arkansas. The rail line was built in 1878 by the Memphis, Helena and Louisiana Railroad.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Three pharmaceutical companies collectively are agreeing to pay the state nearly $70 million to settle allegations that they delayed drugs to keep prices high, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Monday. The bulk of the money will come from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and its affiliates for paying to delay a generic narcolepsy drug, Provigil, from entering the market for nearly six years. Teva is paying $69 million, which Becerra says is the largest pay-for-delay settlement received by any state. Such agreements let the developers of brand-name drugs keep their monopolies over the drugs after their patents expire, thereby letting them continue to charge consumers higher prices. The drug developer pays the generic manufacturer to keep the cheaper version of the drug from entering the marketplace for an agreed period of time.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Federal land managers say they’re reviewing a protest letter from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources over the Trump administration’s management plan for public lands in the southwest corner of the state. Department Director Dan Gibbs sent the U.S. Bureau of Land Management a letter Monday saying the plan doesn’t do enough to protect the which is a threatened species, or migrating wildlife. Gibbs also objected to the way the plan was developed, saying the bureau gave state officials only one day to review it before making it public and opening a 30-day protest period. Bureau spokesman Steven Hall says the agency is considering the letter. The plan covers federal public land in Delta, Gunnison, Mesa, Montrose, Ouray and San Miguel counties.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Politicians and company executives have joined to flip the switch on the state’s newest power plant. Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit No. 5 was officially celebrated Monday with the flip of a giant switch, even though it has been providing power to Fairfield County for about a month. PSEG Power Connecticut LLC’s natural gas-fired plant overlooking Long Island Sound will provide 485 megawatts of power and replace the nearby coal-fired plant, which is scheduled to be retired in June 2021. The new plant can also run on ultra-low sulfur distillate as a backup. Construction began in June 2017. The new plant represents an investment of more than $550 million.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Gov. John Carney has signed the state’s plastic bag ban into law, moving to decrease single-use plastic and litter while protecting the environment. The law signed Monday goes into effect Jan. 1, 2021. News outlets report it will restrict establishments with more than 7,000 square feet of sales space or those with more than three locations from giving out single-use, noncompostable plastic bags. Business can instead provide customers paper, fabric or reusable plastic bags. Restaurants will be exempt, allowing them to supply plastic bags for some foods. Chemicals and live animals also can be contained in plastic bags. A second law Carney signed Monday will increase penalties for illegal dumping and create a fund for enforcing litter laws.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House is preparing to hold its first full committee hearing since 1993 for a bill proposing to recognize the district as the nation’s 51st state. The hearing was postponed to avoid conflicts with congressional testimony by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The Washington Post reports both events initially were planned for July 24. Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton announced Monday that the hearing has since been rescheduled for Sept. 19. The bill has more than 200 co-sponsors in the House and calls for districtwide elections of two senators and one House representative. It says all district territory would be included in the declaration, save for specific exclusions of federal buildings and monuments. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, of Maryland, has said he’s supportive.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Insurance companies have yet to pay about 15% of claims made from Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle. Florida’s top insurance regulator told Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet last week that insurers have yet pay out more than 21,000 claims from last October’s Category 5 storm. Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner David Altmaier says the figure is discouraging. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the law requires insurance companies to pay claims within 90 days of being filed, provided the claims are not contested.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Thousands of petitioners are hoping to stop the demolition of a downtown building where the first country hit song is believed to have been recorded. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Fiddlin’ John Carson likely recorded “Little Log Cabin in the Lane” in the building in 1923. Last month, a Myrtle Beach-based developer planning to build a 21-story, Margaritaville-themed hotel obtained a permit to tear the building down. The lot where the building currently stands would be used for dumpsters and grease traps next to the hotel’s first-floor restaurant. So far, more than 8,000 people have signed an online petition to preserve the building. Atlanta resident and architect Kyle Kessler, who started the petition, says he may stand between the building and the demolition crew if it stops the destruction.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city may lose $220 million in federal flood protection funding if local and state officials cannot agree on terms. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the Army Corps of Engineers must find a sponsor for its $345 million Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project by Wednesday. The corps has proposed to build a wall around Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal and install watershed flood-control structures. Officials say the corps needs the state or city to become project signatories, but neither has finalized the deal. The state has committed in theory to pay $125 million to receive $220 million in federal matching funds, while the city has agreed to serve as the project’s sponsor. Honolulu officials say the city is working out capital funding details with the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The federal government has paid $24 million to farms and dairies in the state in an effort to help them survive financial losses caused by President Donald Trump’s trade wars. But farmers and industry leaders across the state say the payments – ranging from $2 to $300,000 – don’t begin to cover what they’ve lost. Ririe wheat farmer Gordon Gallup told the Idaho Statesman the payments weren’t worth the drive into town. He received about $4,700 last fall. Farms and dairies are still feeling the effects of last summer, when several countries placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported products like steel. The first round of payments for the 2018 crop year sent $24 million to Idaho farms and their local and out-of-state owners. On Thursday, the USDA said an additional $16 billion will be distributed to U.S. farmers this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot marked the 100th anniversary of the 1919 race riots by vowing the city will chart a more equitable future. Lightfoot made the pledge during a commemoration of the violence that has become known as Red Summer, when race riots spread across the United States as whites attacked blacks seeking equal rights, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. In Chicago, a black teen swimming in Lake Michigan was struck in the head with a rock and drowned after drifting toward the white section and angering beachgoers. A week of riots followed the death of 17-year-old Eugene Williams, with 38 people killed and more than 500 injured. Lightfoot on Monday spoke about the “forces of justice and injustice” that Chicago is “still reckoning with a century later.” She pointed to endemic poverty, inadequate health care and violence as problems the city must overcome.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Public Schools district is looking to shift high school students away from traditional school buses to the city’s bus system. The district and the IndyGo transit system will offer city bus passes to about 5,000 students in grades 9-12 as a two-year pilot project starts in August. WFYI-FM reports the passes will let the students travel by regular city bus routes to and from school but also use it year-round for traveling to jobs or extracurricular activities. District official Dennis Tackitt says the district spends more than $12 million a year on high school transportation. That could be cut to about $500,000 annually, or $100 per student, in payments to IndyGo. Tackitt says the plan is to end traditional high school bus service by fall 2021.\n\nIowa\n\nClinton: State safety regulators are proposing fines for two companies involved in a fire and explosion at a grain silo that killed a firefighter and injured another. Clinton fire Lt. Eric Hosette was killed in the Jan. 5 blast and fire at the Archer Daniels Midland Co. silo, and firefighter Adam Cain was injured. The Clinton Herald reports ADM is contesting the nearly $56,000 in penalties proposed by the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Bill Whitter’s Construction is contesting a penalty of nearly $7,800. Iowa OSHA issued ADM five citations, including one that said firefighters were not given adequate information to combat the fire. The agency says Bill Whitter’s Construction was cited because its employees assigned special tasks at the facility, such as bin entry and the handling of flammable or toxic substances, were not trained to safely perform the tasks.\n\nKansas\n\nSedan: A 15-foot-wide fiberglass eagle that perched for 21 years atop a rotating sign at The Wichita Eagle’s former building is getting a new home at a Boy Scouts of America camp. The Wichita Eagle reports that the eagle was removed during a 1988 attempt to modernize the exterior of the building, which later was demolished. From there it went to Camp Tawakoni near Augusta, where it honored the highest rank in Scouting – the Eagle Scout. But when the camp was sold in 2004, it wound up in storage at the Quivira Scout Ranch, where it was rediscovered this year when staff needed the shelf space it occupied. Ranger Paul King says the southeast Kansas camp plans to mount the bird on a pole or pedestal to greet future visitors.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State education officials say a growing teacher shortage has become critical, and they are launching a recruitment campaign. Education Commissioner Wayne Lewis says recruitment efforts could include using programs like Teach for America, working with universities on alternative certification routes and hiring based on work experience. Department of Education spokeswoman Jessica Fletcher says open teaching positions climbed from 6,200 in 2014-15 to 8,800 in 2016-17. The department says there were 5,000 openings earlier this year. News outlets report several issues are mentioned as possible reasons for the shortage, including pensions, politics, pay and the pursuit of higher test scores. Officials say the shortage is caused by teachers leaving the field and fewer college students pursuing an education degree.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s first medical marijuana products are one step away from pharmacies, with final testing planned for this week. Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain says if the product collected Monday from GB Sciences is free of contaminants, medical marijuana could reach patients early next week. Strain says he’s hopeful the testing will clear the product for release. Patients have been waiting years for medical marijuana, after lawmakers created the regulatory framework for dispensing therapeutic cannabis in 2015. Regulatory disagreements slowed getting the product to shelves, with patients, their advocates and lawmakers growing increasingly frustrated with the delays. Only the LSU and Southern University agricultural centers are authorized to grow medical marijuana.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state kicked off its celebration of its 200th birthday – and its separation from Massachusetts – by raising flags statewide Tuesday. The kickoff of Maine’s bicentennial coincides with the 200th anniversary of the vote to separate the District of Maine from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in July 1819. Maine became a state in March 1820. Gov. Janet Mills traveled with the Maine Bicentennial Commission on Tuesday to flag raisings at Presque Isle, Bangor, Portland and Augusta. The governor announced upcoming events that will mark the bicentennial over the next year and a half, including a time capsule, smartphone app and concert series. Sen. Bill Diamond, the Maine Bicentennial Commission chair, said grants are also available for community projects from parades to historic preservation efforts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials who visited public housing communities in the state capital over the weekend heard from residents expressing concerns about gun violence, mental health and living conditions. The Capital reports state Sen. Sarah Elfreth, Del. Alice Cain and Del. Shaneka Henson visited public housing communities in the Annapolis area Saturday. The lawmakers represent the area in the General Assembly. Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman joined them, as well as activists for gun-violence prevention. The campaign was prompted by the recent deaths of Edward Montre Seay, a rapper, and 16-year-old Elijah Wilson, who both were gunned down near public housing communities. Pittman says everyone with whom he spoke said fewer guns are needed. He says that “some said get rid of them altogether.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Newly released data shows city police are monitoring nearly 5,000 people – almost all of them young black and Latino men – through a secretive gang database. A summary provided by the department shows that 66% of those on its database are black, 24% are Latino, and 2% are white. Black people comprise about 25% of all Boston residents, Latinos about 20% and white people more than 50%. A lawsuit brought last fall by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups says Central American youths are being wrongly listed as active gang members “based on nothing more than the clothing they are seen in and the classmates they are seen with.” They say that’s led some to be deported. Boston police haven’t provided comment after multiple requests.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: A woman says she was suspended from her job with the state because she posted a customer service number on a billboard to help people cut through red tape at the Department of Health and Human Services. Kim Ehl was a general office assistant in Flint until she resigned this month. In April 2018, she rented a billboard to display a customer service number to provide answers about public assistance benefits. She says she was frustrated because office policy required that people leave messages with five levels of management before staff could provide the help line information. Spokesman Bob Wheaton told MLive-The Flint Journal that the department doesn’t discuss personnel matters but has a policy requiring all advertising to be approved by the department’s communications office.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State lawmakers have agreed on a plan to get emergency insulin to people who need it, but not on how to pay for it. A bipartisan working group started meeting after a bill to provide emergency insulin to diabetics failed to pass during the legislative session. Democratic Sen. Matt Little of Lakeville said Monday that the group has agreed on how the program would work. The plan calls for providing a 20-day supply to people who have a past or current insulin prescription and who meet certain financial requirements. Some could get an additional two months’ supply, depending on their circumstances. The Star Tribune reports the emergency medications would be available at most pharmacies. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz repeated his support Monday for a fee on drugmakers for insulin assistance.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: This city in the Mississippi Delta is installing speakers to play the blues and other types of regional music near downtown shops and restaurants. Mayor Carolyn McAdams tells the Greenwood Commonwealth the music will bring another mood and ambience to downtown. The city is installing 38 speakers that should be ready in time for the Bikes, Blues & Bayous ride on Saturday. In 2011, the city updated Howard Street with brick sidewalks and crosswalks and period lighting. At the same time, it installed conduits carrying electrical wiring underground for a future speaker system. Greenwood City Councilman Johnny Jennings says he has enjoyed outdoor speakers in other Mississippi cities. The controls for the Greenwood speakers will be in his office.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A proposal to restrict drink specials in this college town has lit up protesters. The Columbia Missourian reports that more than 100 people participated Monday in what was dubbed “A Protest Against Prohibition.” Seven bars and restaurants hosted the protest Monday before a public information meeting to discuss the proposed ordinance. If approved, the ordinance would prohibit drink specials, such as free samples and two-for-one drinks, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. Backers say it would reduce underage drinking, alcohol-related crashes and crime. But Alex Campbell-Graves, who performs as DJ Requiem at several Columbia bars, says he believes the City Council is trying to take away American rights that were fought for in the 1920s.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The city won’t be pursuing criminal charges against Secretary of State Corey Stapleton for using a state pickup truck to travel home to Billings on weekends. Legislative auditors found Stapleton put nearly 28,000 miles on the state vehicle for personal travel from January 2017 through June 2018, costing taxpayers $5,700. The attorney general’s office referred the investigation to Helena Police. City Attorney Thomas Jodoin wrote to the state Department of Criminal Investigations on Monday saying that the one-year statute of limitations on the alleged misdemeanor expired last month, so the city wouldn’t be filing charges. Auditors noted their findings didn’t account for any travel that may have occurred from July 2018 through April 2019, when auditors questioned the use of the vehicle and it was returned to the state motor pool.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city has been awarded a $2.6 million federal grant to buy more electric-powered public transit buses. The grant is from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration. The city plans to use the money to replace six diesel-powered buses. The grant will also fund three charging stations and additional training. The electric buses are expected to be in service the summer of 2021. Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird thanked Nebraska’s federal congressional delegation – especially U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer – for helping secure the grant. Manufacturer New Flyer says an electric bus saves 100 to 160 tons of greenhouse gases per year compared to a 40-foot diesel bus. StarTran Transit Manager Mike Davis says the newer buses will also improve overall reliability.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A jump in winnings by casinos in June helped push statewide revenue figures up a tick, to more than $11.9 billion to end the fiscal year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board on Tuesday reported total “gaming win” of a little more than $1 billion last month, up nearly 11.6% compared with June 2018. That pushed what had been a flat 12-month revenue comparison up to 0.8% from fiscal 2018. A year ago, the state reported a 3.2% increase from fiscal 2017. Gambling is second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state’s $14 billion annual budget. The report says Nevada collected $55 million in percentage fee taxes based on June figures. That was up 15.9% from a year ago.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A police officer says the kitten he was trying to pick up in a parking lot turned out to be a bobcat, which then jumped onto the roof of a Burger King. Stratham Officer Matt Callahan tells Seacoastonline.com he was on patrol Saturday and saw the “kitten” run under a car. It eventually climbed a tree near the restaurant. Once Callahan realized he was dealing with a young bobcat, he called state Fish and Game officers. He also stood in the drive-thru line to alert customers in case the bobcat decided to come down, but it climbed onto the roof and took a catnap. Callahan says he and the conservation officer climbed the roof and put the bobcat in a crate. The bobcat was released at a wildlife refuge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A federal judge has upheld the state’s law that lowers the number of bullets a gun can hold. The judge sitting in Trenton on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun rights group. New Jersey passed a law last year that made it unlawful to possess firearm magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, with some exceptions. The state says that’s enough for self-defense, and anything more could prove dangerous to bystanders. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs argues that the law only hurts law-abiding gun owners and homeowners because criminals will ignore it. An attorney for the group says it will appeal the ruling. Previously, a federal appeals court declined to grant an injunction to stop the law from taking effect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Less than a third of all students in the state are proficient in reading, and only about one-fifth are proficient in math, according to numbers released Friday. The results from a revamped test in 2019 show that public school districts and charter schools saw a small jump in reading from the year before but a slight drop in math – though the scores are from separate exams. According to the results, only 32.7% of all New Mexico students tested proficient or better in reading. Meanwhile, just 20.3% tested proficient or better in math. Last year, results from the test called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers showed that about 31% of students tested were proficient or better in reading, and more than 21% were proficient or better in math.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A judge says the owners of the Woodstock music festival name can license it to create a marijuana brand marking the 50th anniversary of the famed gathering. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe on Monday rejected a claim that the deal would infringe on the name of another company, Woodstock Roots. Gardephe concluded the nature of the planned Woodstock-branded recreational marijuana and a competitor’s cannabis-related smoking paraphernalia are different. Woodstock Ventures, which produced the 1969 Woodstock festival, and Woodstock Roots sued each other last year. Woodstock Roots does business as Woodstock American Products. Woodstock Ventures argued recreational marijuana falls within its “natural zone of expansion” under federal trademark law. It is working on a deal with a major dispensary.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Tar Heel State now has a new state park and three new state trails. Earlier this month, Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill adding Pisgah View State Park in Buncombe and Haywood counties to North Carolina’s state parks. He also signed bills adding three state trails: Northern Peaks State Trail in Watauga and Ashe counties; the Wilderness Gateway State Trail in the South Mountains range in McDowell, Rutherford, Burke and Catawba counties; and the Overmountain Victory State Trail, which stretches across nine counties. The Division of Parks and Recreation will also conduct a feasibility study that will further refine a corridor for the new Wilderness Gateway State Trail in Burke and Catawba counties. The division will report to legislators by Dec. 1.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A recent study by the U.S. Geological Survey says it could take hundreds of years for the salt concentrations in the Williston Basin to return to normal levels in groundwater. Brine makes its way up to the earth’s surface when oil and gas is extracted. Today, saltwater is injected back underground for storage. Decades ago, brine was dumped into temporary “reserve” pits at well sites or at central collection facilities known as “evaporation” pits. The Bismarck Tribune reports that brine contamination can make water wells unusable as global amphibian populations are in decline. The research analyzed water quality, sediment and tadpoles at 32 wetland sites across Montana and North Dakota in the Williston Basin. Some areas in the basin can meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s “acute” toxicity benchmark by 2045.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State prison officials say inmates may soon be offered tattoo removal services. The Dayton Daily News reports Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Director Annette Chambers-Smith says the state is researching costs and logistics of removing tattoos on prisoners’ faces, necks and hands. She says tattoos can hurt inmates’ job prospects once they are released. Chambers-Smith says funding could come from the department’s medical budget or from fees collected from inmates when they buy items from prison commissaries. She says the state will seek proposals from those who provide removal services. Department rules bar inmates from having tattooing equipment and from getting tattoos inside the prisons. The use of non-sterile equipment for tattooing can cause infections and spread diseases. Tattoos also can signal gang membership.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPawhuska: Director Martin Scorsese has visited the state and met with the principal chief of the Osage Nation to discuss filming his upcoming adaptation of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The Tulsa World reports Scorsese and others involved in the film met with Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear and other Osage representatives for about two hours to discuss how the movie will accurately portray the tribe’s culture, history and language. The movie is an adaptation of David Grann’s nonfiction book “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.” It documents the 1920s slayings of wealthy Osage tribal members after the discovery of oil on their land. Standing Bear said Scorsese told him Robert DeNiro will play cattleman William Hale. Leonardo DiCaprio is also set to star.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city is finalizing an $80,000 settlement to end a lawsuit by a former employee who alleged “extreme hazing” by city transportation workers. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Adam Rawlins said in U.S. District Court that he was subjected to verbal and physical hazing for several months in 2016, including one incident in which Rawlins was photographed while bound by zip ties and duct tape inside a city shed. A consultant later hired by the city found a “don’t snitch” culture within the maintenance operation of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. But city officials said the incident appeared to be isolated. The proposed settlement heads to the Portland City Council for approval Wednesday. The city’s risk management division found that “there is risk the city may be found liable.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A regatta that has been a tradition in the city for more than four decades has been canceled days before its scheduled opening. Attorney Charles Scholz told reporters Tuesday that the EQT Three Rivers Regatta’s promoter, LionHeart Event Group, hadn’t secured proper permits or paid vendors, including the state for use of Point State Park and police. Scholz said the regatta board had no choice but to withdrew its permit application. Officials said investigations had begun, and legal remedies would be pursued with an eye to bringing the regatta back next year. A summer tradition since 1978, the regatta features powerboat races, an “Anything that Floats” race, and various water stunts and concerts.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has enacted a “student loan bill of rights” to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices. The law took effect with the governor’s signature last week. Treasurer Seth Magaziner says it provides important consumer protections. The law sets standards for student loan servicing to prohibit predatory behavior. It requires that student loan servicers register with the state and allows state regulators to examine their business practices. The state could penalize violators. Democratic Rep. Joseph McNamara, of Warwick, and Sen. Dawn Euer, of Newport, sponsored the legislation. Magaziner’s office says more than 133,000 Rhode Island residents, including 16,000 senior citizens, have a combined $4.5 billion in student loan debt. About $470 million of that is delinquent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 100 students who are in juvenile jails across the state are getting their high school diplomas. The Department of Juvenile Justice said a ceremony with caps and gowns will take place Wednesday at the agency’s main prison in Columbia. DJJ Director Freddie Pough said in a statement that getting a high school diploma is an important step to show juvenile offenders that education can open up opportunities and change the direction of their lives. The agency has fewer high school graduates than in recent years. But officials say nearly two-thirds of the offenders in South Carolina’s juvenile prisons are in eighth or ninth grade, and many of them are on track to finish high school.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A political activist wants a federal judge to block a new state law that would place requirements on groups promoting ballot measures. Cory Heidelberger requested a court order Monday to prevent a bill passed by lawmakers from taking effect. The bill passed in the last session and is set to become part of South Dakota’s election laws July 1, 2020. Heidelberger argues the bill was intended to make it harder for groups to launch successful ballot measures. The lawsuit names Gov. Kristi Noem, Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg and Secretary of State Steve Barnett, all Republicans. In May, Heidelberger succeeded in getting an initiated measure that South Dakota voters passed in 2018 declared invalid. That measure placed restrictions on out-of-state money on ballot measures.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: A group of eight Girl Scouts from across the country spent part of their summer volunteering in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Their efforts included rehabilitating trails, cleaning campgrounds, removing invasive plants and providing educational programs to visitors. The park says the high schoolers worked alongside female leaders who taught them how to operate equipment and use hand tools. They also explored career opportunities in conservation and park management. The program was a collaboration among the Student Conservation Association, the Girl Scouts of America and the National Park Service.\n\nTexas\n\nWestphalia: A historic rural Roman Catholic church that had served its surrounding Central Texas farming community for more than a century has burned to the ground. Photos posted on the Austin Catholic diocesan Facebook page show the Church of the Visitation in Westphalia fully engulfed in flames Monday morning, being reduced to nothing more than ashes. The parish has served the faithful of southwestern Falls County, many of them immigrants from the northwest German region of Westphalia, since 1883. The church building dated to 1895 and was said to be the largest all-wood church in the state. Its stained-glass windows, more than 20 in all, were shipped to Westphalia from Germany. No injuries were reported. A statement from the diocese says the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: San Juan County paid a consulting firm nearly $500,000 to lobby against the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument and for the downsizing of it after it was created, according to newly released public records. The small county paid New Orleans-based Davillier Law Group $485,600 in 2016-2017 to prepare information packets sent to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Davillier also researched how the creation of the monument would affect uranium mining in the area and if a president could rescind a monument based on national security concerns related to the uranium, the documents show. Davillier attorneys charged $500 an hour, and sometimes their bills included air travel.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Hikers and climbers can once again enjoy the state’s cliffs starting Thursday, as a crucial nesting season for one bird species comes to a close. For several months toward the end of spring through July, some cliffs around Vermont are closed so peregrine falcons can stand a fighting chance against extinction in the state. The falcons call those cliffs home, so the sensitive population could be harmed unless their habitats are closed off to human use during the birds’ nesting season. Since early May, the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife had closed 14 sites around the state so the birds could nest safely. The falcons were removed from the Vermont endangered species list in 2005 but are sensitive. Their decline is believed to be linked to the insecticide DDT, which wasn’t banned until the 1970s, and to human interference.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Collecting tolls in the Hampton Roads region generates about $180 million a year – nearly twice the size of the region’s fishing and farming sectors combined, The Virginian-Pilot reports – and it’s set to rise. The Virginia Department of Transportation and the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization are considering how far to extend Norfolk’s High Occupancy Toll Lanes. In addition, the Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission is looking to HOT lanes to pay for about 10% of its $3.5 billion commitment to fix the area’s worst bottleneck at the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel. The panel’s six-year plan projects collecting between $3.5 million and $4.5 million a year, beginning in fiscal 2023.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap: A state law enabling individual criminal records to be cleared has taken effect. The New Hope Act took effect Sunday after unanimous passage in both houses of the Legislature. Officials say the new law streamlines and modifies the process for people with criminal records to vacate convictions. The law allows multiple misdemeanors to be vacated, rather than the previous law allowing removal of only a single misdemeanor. The law also adds some felony offenses to a list of convictions that can be removed. Those with criminal records are required to wait for specific time periods during which they must repay legal fees and exhibit good behavior. The waiting periods of three, five and 10 years are dependent on the crimes committed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Some state employees are getting a pay raise next month. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the move comes after the state Personnel Board voted last week to update salary schedules for the first time in a decade. Personnel Director Sheryl Webb said because it had been so long, the government’s first three pay grades were below minimum wage and unusable. She said officials had to balance the need for more competitive salaries with the reality that the state can’t afford multimillion-dollar pay adjustments. Under the new plan, the minimum salary at the lowest pay grade will increase from $16,008 to $18,249, and the maximum salary at the highest pay grade will increase from $114,888 to $117,182. There also will be proportionate increases for other pay grades.\n\nWisconsin\n\nBayside: Schlitz Audubon Nature Center is about to undertake the biggest land improvement project in its nearly 50-year history. The project, scheduled to begin Thursday and run through mid-September, will restore ravines that have deteriorated due to heavy storms, as well as aim to prevent those ravines from further damage. Audubon Center officials are particularly concerned about the north ravine area, the highest-quality natural area on the 185-acre property and home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the rusty-patched bumblebee, a federally endangered species, and the blue-stemmed goldenrod, a state endangered species. The north ravine has been destabilized in recent years as erosive stormwater has washed away the soil.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An American Indian tribe opposes a company’s plan to dump oil-field wastewater upstream of a river in central Wyoming. The Northern Arapaho Tribe says Aethon Energy’s plans to put more than 8 million gallons of polluted water into two creeks would affect tribal business opportunities. The creeks flow into the Wind River and Boysen Reservoir. Tribal officials tell Wyoming regulators in a recent letter that the pollution could harm tribal fishing and rafting guide businesses. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has concerns. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality is reviewing public comments on the plan. Dallas-based Aethon says it would follow all regulations and offer more water protections than those required under previous permits. The Wind River flows through the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/09/smokey-bear-tarantula-trek-censoring-adam-eve-news-around-states/39932141/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Some residents of a rural community are complaining about a Spanish-language event planned for this weekend featuring live music and bull riding, but a local official says he worries such comments appear “anti-Latino.” News outlets report people from the Snowdoun area near Montgomery have asked county and city leaders to block the Festival Latino, scheduled Sunday in a field. They say a similar event in July was so loud and raucous it traumatized livestock. But Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange says organizers haven’t violated any zoning rules. County Commissioner Dan Harris says he voted against a move to block the festival because opposition appears to be “anti-Latino” even if it isn’t. Harris says he doesn’t want to be part of that, particularly after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A wildlife monitoring group is seeking citizen scientists to help track beluga whales off the state’s coast. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Alaska Beluga Monitoring Partnership is offering volunteers an opportunity to help scientists understand more about Cook Inlet beluga whales. The partnership is a collaboration of several organizations including Beluga Whale Alliance, Defenders of Wildlife and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Monitoring events are expected to take place between Aug. 14 and Nov. 15. Planned monitoring locations include Twentymile River and Bird Point near Girdwood, Ship Creek in Anchorage, and the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers. Officials say volunteers will learn about the conservation needs of Cook Inlet beluga whales and receive training on identifying and recording data on beluga distribution and behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials have approved placing a “sanctuary city” measure on the ballot, but not without some pushback. KVOA-TV reports the Tucson City Council voted Tuesday night to allow the initiative on the November ballot, which could potentially lead to Arizona’s first-ever “sanctuary city.” Councilmembers were required to vote after the measure got more than the minimum required number of petition signatures. The initiative would add protections for people living in the U.S. illegally. Video shows a woman wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat repeatedly shouting that the initiative defies U.S. immigration law. The footage has since gone viral on social media because of an man in a green polo shirt laughing nearby. #GreenShirtGuy was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is asking lawmakers to approve $25 million for a new state grant program aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the creation of the Arkansas Rural Connect program, which will provide grants to qualifying communities with at least 500 people to deploy high-speed broadband to residents. Hutchinson, who announced the program at a meeting of the Arkansas Sheriffs’ Association in Rogers, says he’ll ask the Legislative Council to approve $5.7 million for the program this year, and the remainder will need to be appropriated by lawmakers in next year’s legislative session. In May, Hutchinson released a plan to expand rural access to high-speed broadband by 2022.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Actor Danny Trejo played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after two cars collided at an intersection in the Sylmar neighborhood Wednesday. Video aired by KABC-TV shows Trejo at the crash scene. Trejo says he crawled into the wrecked vehicle from one side but couldn’t unbuckle the child’s car seat from that angle. He says another bystander, a young woman, was able to undo the buckle. Together they pulled the baby safely from the wreckage. The Los Angeles Fire Department says three people were taken to a hospital, and there were no life-threatening injuries. The 75-year-old Trejo, an L.A. native, is perhaps best known for playing the character Machete, originally from the “Spy Kids” series.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: State wildlife officials say thousands of tarantulas are expected to start their annual migration through the state soon. The Gazette reports the migration is expected to begin this month through early October. Officials say the Oklahoma brown tarantulas migrate through La Junta, about 176 miles southeast of Denver. Scientists say the majority of the spiders are 10-year-old males looking to mate with females hidden in Colorado’s grasslands. Officials say the peak time to view the migration is mid-September near Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta off U.S. Highway 109. Officials say tarantulas are mostly harmless to humans but have bites that can cause injury or allergic reaction and hairs that can be irritating to the eyes, mouth and nose.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The federal Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into the state’s policy allowing transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. The investigation follows a complaint by the families of three girls who say they were discriminated against by having to compete in track against two athletes who were identified as male at birth. They say that violates Title IX, the federal law designed to ensure equal athletic opportunities for females. The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by their gender identification. Transathlete.com says Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Everyone’s a critic, including Delaware Air National Guard officials who wanted nude images of Adam and Eve depicted in a 50-year-old mural by famed artist Jamie Wyeth to put on some pants. Someone apparently isn’t mooning over the huge, 10-by-30-foot mural that shows the bare buttocks of the Garden of Eden couple. It hangs on a wall of a building at the guard’s 80-acre base at the New Castle County Airport. The mural was created by Wyeth when he served with the Delaware Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Air National Guard officials have had recent talks about possibly altering or covering up part of the artwork by the well-known painter. Wyeth is the scion of three generations of widely celebrated American artists, including his illustrator grandfather N.C. Wyeth and his late father Andrew Wyeth, one of the best-known painters of the 20th century.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An internal review of D.C. public schools shows more than 30% of employees have expired background checks. News outlets report Chancellor Lewis Ferebee shared the review’s findings with parents Tuesday and in a letter Wednesday. The district launched the review in June after an employee of a private before- and after-school program allegedly kissed and fondled a 13-year-old student on multiple occasions. The district says it discovered the company didn’t conduct proper background checks. Ferebee says by the end of October, all after-school staff, school staff and central office staff will have active background checks. He also says staff will receive more training on how to spot and respond to sexual misconduct cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state is expanding its efforts to eradicate invasive pythons in the Everglades and is working with the federal government to get snake hunters to remote areas of Big Cypress National Preserve. DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida will double its resources for python removal and that the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Agriculture have a new agreement to begin hunting pythons in 130,000 acres of state parks. He’s directing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the South Florida Water Management District to work together to research ways to eliminate pythons and to make a python challenge an annual event instead of once every three years. The challenge awards python hunters who capture the most snakes, which have decimated native species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMilton: A farmer says his beloved miniature donkey named Sammy was literally scared to death by this year’s Fourth of July fireworks. Now he and an animal rights group want Georgia to ban rockets that go boom. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker David Ralston and others Wednesday asking for a “Sammy’s law” limiting fireworks to the non-explosive, non-aerial varieties. John Bogino tells WGCL-TV that Sammy and his other farm animals are like pets to him. His pet donkey of 22 years died last month, and he says Sammy wasn’t his first animal to die because of fireworks. He says one of his horses fled explosions in late July several years ago and had to be euthanized due to severe injuries.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists have discovered that a growing pond of water inside a crater is being heated by the Kilauea volcano. The U.S. Geological Survey says temperature readings taken last weekend show that the pool of water in Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, the former home of a popular lava lake, is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit. For the first time in recorded history, the presence of water in the crater was confirmed last week. Since then, scientists have found two other small pools of water nearby. The crater floor collapsed about 2,000 feet, and the lava lake disappeared last summer as Kilauea stopped erupting for the first time in over 30 years. USGS geologist Matt Patrick told the Associated Press it’s hard to determine how deep the magma chamber is beneath the bottom of the crater floor where the water was found.\n\nIdaho\n\nSpokane: A study by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has found that cougars kill more elk than wolves in the state. The Spokesman-Review reports the study found that wolves accounted for 32% of adult female elk deaths and 28% of elk calf deaths. The study found that cougars accounted for 35% of adult female elk deaths and 45% of elk calf deaths. The study published earlier this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management examined 15 years of data. The study also found that food availability and the severity of winter is the most important factor for elk calf survival. Idaho Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife research biologist Jon Horne says the findings are also likely applicable for Washington, Montana and Canada.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Officials are showcasing one of the most popular attractions of the Illinois State Fair. The butter cow was unveiled Wednesday afternoon at the fairgrounds. The sculpture has been a part of the state fair for almost 100 years. This year’s cow has been sculpted from 800 pounds of recycled butter. The cow stands near the word “Future” to incorporate the theme of the fair, which is “Building Our Future.” The cow is on display at the Dairy Building. Last year, hundreds of pounds of butter were sculpted into a cow by the same Iowa artist, Sarah Pratt. The base had “Land of Lincoln” written on it and included a stovepipe hat, as a nod to Abraham Lincoln. The fair started Thursday and ends Aug. 18.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Rainbow-colored streamers welcomed students back for the first day of classes Thursday at Cathedral High School, a show of support for a gay teacher fired from the Catholic school over the summer. The brightly colored streamers were a silent twist on a long-held Cathedral tradition to decorate “the hill” with toilet paper on the first day of school, but they still spoke volumes. The private high school has been embroiled in a debate over LGBTQ rights since it fired longtime teacher Joshua Payne-Elliott because of his same-sex marriage. Cathedral officials have said they only did so at the order of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which began requiring employment contracts with “ministerial language” and morality clauses to be used at its schools four years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: They’ve built it. Now they’re coming. Major League Baseball is headed to town in 2020. The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees announced Thursday that the two teams will play an official big-league game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site Aug. 13, 2020. “It’s definitely exciting,” says Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go the Distance Baseball, which owns the Field of Dreams movie site. “There’s nothing more American than the Field of Dreams and America’s pastime.” The 1989 movie centers on the 1919 White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson. Jackson, who was banned by MLB along with seven of his teammates for his alleged role in the White Sox throwing the 1919 World Series, inspires a farmer, played by Kevin Costner, to build a baseball field. The site has since become a tourist attraction, with fans from across the globe flocking to the Iowa cornfield to see it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to impose what some tax experts say would be the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting taxes on online sales, possibly inviting a legal battle. The Department of Revenue issued a notice last week saying any “remote seller” doing business with Kansas residents must register with the department, collect state and local sales taxes, and forward the revenues to the state, starting Oct. 1. It cites a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year allowing states to collect sales taxes on internet sales. Most states now have policies to collect such taxes, but almost all set minimum annual sales or transaction thresholds to exempt small businesses, according to groups tracking tax laws. Kansas is the first to attempt to collect the taxes without exempting any businesses, they said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Amid major legislative efforts to restrict or end abortion in the state, a new poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood finds a majority of likely voters in the commonwealth believe the procedure should remain available. Asked whether it’s important for women to have “access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion,” 65% said yes, according to the poll. Also, 65% said they’d have doubts about a law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion. Just 18% said they believe all abortions should be illegal – though another 37% said abortion should be allowed only in “extreme cases,” such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. And 43% said abortion should be legal with some regulations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPride: A highway marker honoring blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy has been recovered, months after it disappeared. News outlets report Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office received a tip Wednesday that the sign was at a person’s house in Pride, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. Lt. Craig Dabadie says investigators believe a driver ran off the road and knocked the sign off a pole in May. Someone else picked it up as a souvenir. The sign was posted along Louisiana 1, marking the spot where Guy recorded a music video. The marker honors the Louisiana native’s legacy in music. Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 23 on its list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists.” No arrests were made, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal program designed to help farmers suffering due to trade disruption is unlikely to assist the state’s wild blueberry growers. Maine is the sole commercial producer of wild blueberries in the United States. The industry has struggled in recent years with falling crop sizes and low prices to farmers. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal has called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include the crop in its Market Facilitation Program, which is slated to provide billions to growers negatively impacted by foreign trade retaliation. But the USDA said in a statement that the program is intended for crops that aren’t easily used in school food programs or through food banks. Wild blueberries sometimes fill those needs. The agency says the blueberries remain eligible for other USDA assistance programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The news of Toni Morrison’s death led a west Baltimore artist to create his own version of an ancestral shrine. The Baltimore Sun reports that 50-year-old Ernest Shaw Jr. completed a mural of the celebrated artist and Nobel laureate by Tuesday, just a day after Morrison’s death. Shaw says he considers the death of the 88-year-old Morrison to be the acquiring of an ancestor. He says creating the mural was his way of pouring libations, a reference to a ritual used to honor ancestors and deities. He says there’s no death in dying as Morrison has just transitioned to now work with “the other side.” The spontaneous mural dedicated to “TONI M” covers a Graffiti Alley wall behind Motor House and took several hours to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Ever since “Boston Strong” became a rallying cry after the Boston Marathon bombing, the idea of “strong” has become an inescapable part of how this country heals after tragedy. People mourning this past weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas have rallied around the slogans “Dayton Strong” and “El Paso Strong.” After many tragedies, the mantra has been used in social media posts, memorials, pins, stickers and other mementos. Massachusetts resident Christopher Dobens co-created the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” T-shirts that helped rocket the phrase into the national lexicon. He says the idea was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong cancer foundation and the U.S. Army’s “Army Strong” slogan. Dobens says it’s heartbreaking to see so many places have had to adopt the “strong” mantra because of violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: State and federal agencies are gearing up for a celebration of Smokey Bear’s 75-year legacy of preventing forest fires. Smokey will join staffers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other partners Friday at Straits State Park in St. Ignace. A family-friendly birthday party is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. It will feature a fire truck open house, displays of wildland fire equipment, fire-prevention games, refreshments and an opportunity to meet the iconic bear. Smokey has shared fire-prevention messages with the signature phrase, “Only you can prevent wildfires.” Debbie Begalle of the Michigan DNR’s Forest Resources Division says the slogan is still relevant. Nine out of 10 wildfires are started by people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Natural Resources has denied requests to reconsider the tailings dam permits that it issued for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The DNR said Wednesday that opponents did not raise any new issues that materially affect its 2018 decision granting the permits. The Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa and environmental groups asked the DNR to reconsider in light of tailings dam failures elsewhere. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a statement that her agency studied the failures but remains confident in the safety of the PolyMet dam. The DNR issued its decision one day after the Minnesota Court of Appeals stayed a different permit for the mine, governing water pollution, pending a court investigation into potential irregularities in how state and federal regulators handled that permit.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Hurricane Katrina left lasting scars on the Hurricane Camille Memorial at the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. The church reached out to the Biloxi Fire Department, which, in turn, reached out to Lodging and Leisure Investments for help in returning the memorial to its best condition in light of the storm’s upcoming 50th anniversary. Officials tell WLOX-TV restoring the tile mosaic is the greatest challenge in the project. Other work includes power washing and cleaning each name on the memorial’s walls. Camille’s 50th anniversary will include a memorial service at the memorial site at 5 p.m. Aug. 17. Afterward, a program will be held at the Seafood & Maritime Industry Museum at 6 p.m.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Attorney General Eric Schmitt says counting of untested rape kits in the state is nearly complete. Schmitt said Wednesday that 95.6% of law enforcement agencies and 98.5% of hospitals and Veterans Affairs medical facilities have completed their inventory of sexual assault evidence kits. Former Attorney General Josh Hawley began an audit of the backlog in 2017 after the Columbia Missourian reported Missouri had never done a statewide review of untested rape kits. Schmitt began a SAFE Kits Initiative in February and appointed Judge M. Keithley Williams to lead the effort to eliminate the backlog of sexual assault kits. The counting project received funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Rape kits contain DNA samples and other evidence from medical procedures conducted immediately after an attack.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do, his attorney says. Attorney Lance Jasper told the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who became caught up in the heightened animosity and rhetoric gripping the nation and convinced himself he was following the president’s orders. “His commander in chief is telling people that if they kneel, they should be fired, or if they burn a flag, they should be punished,” Jasper said. He said Brockway “certainly didn’t understand it was a crime.” Brockway suffered a traumatic brain injury in a vehicle crash in 2000 that has affected his decision making, and Jasper said he plans to raise that in his client’s defense.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The remains of twins who joined the Navy together have been returned to the city for burial, decades after their deaths on a battleship at Pearl Harbor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports two ceremonies will be held in succession Saturday at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery for Rudolph Blitz and brother Leo Blitz. There will be two flag-covered caskets, two 21-gun salutes, two invocations, two flags presented to their surviving sister, 93-year-old Lincoln resident Betty Pitsch. Her DNA contribution helped bring her older brothers home. The 17-year-old twins left Lincoln High to join the Navy in 1938 and had been stationed at Pearl Harbor for a year and a day before the USS Oklahoma went down during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. Their remains were buried at a Honolulu cemetery and later identified after being unearthed in 2015.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A jumbo jetliner that sparked controversy at last year’s Burning Man festival when it got stuck in the desert for nearly a month has returned for this year’s event after organizers agreed to post a bond for the popular art installation. The Bureau of Land Management granted a special permit to the foundation that converted the 747 into a nightclub. Burning Man officials reviewed the Big Imagination Foundation’s plans before it transported the multi-ton aircraft last weekend to the Black Rock Desert, 100 miles north of Reno. Group leaders haven’t disclosed the cost of the performance bond. They get the money back if they comply with the permit. Critics say the plane severely damaged the playa floor last year when it dug holes into the soft alkali dust and got stuck.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a bill to help the state’s dairy farmers. The purpose of the bill is to provide a way to support dairy farmers by buying specially labeled milk for an extra 50 cents per gallon. The measure creates a dairy premium fund that replaces the milk producers’ emergency relief fund. Money remaining in the fund after payment of the premiums would be available to promote the program. It’s anticipated that the premium milk will be available this fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: Two actors from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” visited federal immigration detainees at the Hudson County jail Thursday. Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver met with two female detainees from Jamaica. The actors, whose show tackled issues of immigration detention and family separation in its final season, said they wanted to draw attention to the plight of immigrants in such facilities. The visit was organized by Freedom for Immigrants, an organization that aims to abolish immigration detention and was featured in the final season of the show, and First Friends of New Jersey and New York, a nonprofit that sends volunteers to visit immigrant detainees. After leaving the jail, Tarver recounted the story of the woman she met, a victim of domestic violence who sought help from the police and wound up detained, for four months so far, when her immigration status came into play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSan Antonio: A federal agency is taking advantage of high water levels in the Rio Grande to help a tiny minnow listed as an endangered species. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation workers recently aided in creating more habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow on the Middle Rio Grande, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Reclamation crews worked from January to March to lower and widen the riverbank on the southern end of private property near Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They excavated 46,000 cubic yards of dirt to create water channels where minnows could escape the fast-moving river. The tiny fish, listed as endangered in 1994, was once abundant throughout the Rio Grande Basin from Colorado to Texas and into Mexico. It’s now found only in a fraction of its historic habitat as the river system has seen dam building and the straightening of its once meandering channels over the past 150 years.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has approved legislation aimed at bolstering the health and safety standards for all pet dealers operating in the state. The bill signed Thursday calls for separate spaces for pregnant animals and requires all enclosures be cleaned daily and disinfected at least once every two weeks. “Pet dealers must be held to standards that will promote the safety, good health, and overall well-being of the animals in their care,” says a memo attached to the bill. Under the new law, which takes effect in 90 days, pet dealers are required to regularly groom animals to prevent matting and flea and tick infestations and provide animals with diurnal lighting cycles, which mimic natural, 24-hour light patterns. And any for-profit dealer selling, or planning to sell, at least 25 cats or dogs in a year must provide an annual veterinary checkup for each animal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: The city is being recognized for its commitment to preserving monarch butterflies. Wake Forest announced Wednesday that the recognition was awarded by Monarch City USA, a nonprofit organization that promotes the species and recognizes areas that work on recovering butterfly populations. The nonprofit group says that the butterflies rely on milkweed and nectar plants. The butterfly’s population has declined as the plants have dwindled. Wake Forest, northeast of Raleigh, features the plants that attract the butterflies at E. Carroll Joyner Park. The town has installed signs that identify the butterfly habitat and one noting Wake Forest’s designation as a “Monarch City USA.” The nonprofit says it’s the first in the state to receive the designation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two environmental groups who say regulators should have intervened in the location of an oil refinery near the state’s top tourist attraction, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, are taking their case to the state Supreme Court. The Public Service Commission last year declined to review whether the refinery could be built just 3 miles from the park in the western Badlands, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators concluded the proposed $800 million Davis Refinery would be too small to warrant review under state law. The Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council don’t believe developer Meridian Energy Group is being forthright about the refinery’s size and asked a state judge to force the commission to hold a hearing. South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick refused in May, ruling that the PSC followed state law.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringdale: A long-standing community event is facing backlash on social media. A Facebook post promoting Springdale’s annual Goldfish Swim has garnered more than 3,500 comments, most outraged, since it was posted Aug. 1. The end-of-summer event has been going on for almost 40 years. More than 4,700 people have signed a Change.org petition to stop the event, saying it is “obvious” animal abuse. City officials take 1,000 feeder goldfish and put them in the Springdale Community Center Pool. Children under the age of 12 try to catch the fish with their bare hands, take them home and care for them. “No nets, poles or help from mom and dad. Bring a plastic bucket to take your new pet home,” the post about the event says. The event is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Springdale Pool.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Police were justified when they fatally shot a black teenager who was naked and unarmed, an attorney for the city argues in a response to a civil rights lawsuit filed by the teen’s parents. The parents of Isaiah Mark Lewis contend in their federal lawsuit that Sgt. Milo Box and Officer Denton Scherman used excessive force and acted “unnecessarily and unjustly” when they hit their 17-year-old son with a stun gun and then fatally shot him April 29 after he allegedly broke into a home. In a response filed Wednesday on behalf of the city, attorney Taylor Clark denies that the city violated Lewis’ constitutional rights and says: “Lewis was justifiably shot by a service weapon after being ineffectively tasered.” “Edmond also admits that Isaiah Mark Lewis was naked and unarmed when he was shot and that verbal commands were given to Isaiah Mark Lewis prior to the shooting,” Clark wrote. The officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Taylor declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge has ruled that the state Fish and Wildlife Commission illegally reversed an earlier decision granting endangered species status to the marbled murrelet, a small seabird that nests in old-growth forests. Environmental groups say Oregon has sought to avoid protections for the bird, allowing clear-cut logging in its habitat. A spokeswoman for the wildlife department said it won’t comment on legal matters. The ruling was by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Holland in Eugene. Conservation groups said they petitioned the wildlife commission to list the marbled murrelet as endangered, and it voted to do so, concluding the bird was likely to go extinct. But the commission reversed itself without explanation. Holland said the commission was required to explain its reversal and failed to do so.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia’s Music Alliance will induct musicians spanning a wide range of genres to its Walk of Fame, including The Philadelphia Orchestra, R&B group The O’Jays and ’80s rock band The Hooters. The class of 2019’s other honorees include Philadelphia socialite and philanthropist Dorrance “Dodo” Hamilton, who died in 2017; disco queen Evelyn “Champagne” King; and Jody Gerson, the current CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and the first woman to run a major music-publishing company. Longtime rock-radio DJ Pierre Robert is this year’s dual Radio Row Award recipient and Walk of Fame inductee. The announcements were made Wednesday at the Independence Visitor Center. The group will be formally inducted Oct. 22 during a gala at The Bellevue.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state will begin offering a gender-neutral option for residents to put on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates. Rhode Island will join the ranks of about a dozen other states already offering an option of “X” instead of the standard “M” or “F.” The option is in response to the governor’s conversations with the transgender and LGBTQ community. The Democratic governor says this is “just basic fairness” in order to ensure all residents are being recognized for who they are. The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health echoed the governor’s remarks. The governor adds that the biggest hurdle has been the implementation of the change. Residents could potentially see the option available within a year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAiken: Officials say the U.S. government followed a requirement to remove weapons-grade plutonium from the state. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 1 metric ton of nuclear material has been shipped out of the Savannah River Site near Aiken. The U.S. Energy Department was ordered in 2017 to remove that much plutonium by January. Federal court records said half the plutonium was sent to Nevada. Wilson’s statement Wednesday didn’t say where the other half was shipped. South Carolina sued the federal agency after it halted a plan to turn plutonium once used to make nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors. The Energy Department owes the state $200 million in fines in part because 11 metric tons of plutonium remain at the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: As this small town recovers from a tornado that destroyed its civic center and caused other extensive damage, some residents are asking why the community’s warning siren wasn’t sounded. The EF-1 tornado with 100 mph winds ripped through Burke on Tuesday night, ripping roofs off buildings and homes, uprooting trees and leaving the school building unusable for the beginning of classes. Two men suffered minor injuries when a garage collapsed. Gov. Kristi Noem visited the community Wednesday and called the damage “unbelievable.” Noem promised the state’s help in the community’s restoration efforts. Burke Mayor Thomas Glover says the siren is sounded when officials get notification of a tornado sighting or that one is imminent. Glover says that did not happen.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Add Glen Campbell to the list of late country music legends with a museum in their honor in the city’s downtown. Clearbrook Hospitality LLC announced plans Thursday to open The Glen Campbell Museum and Rhinestone Stage, a live music venue, at the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue. It’s slated to open in early 2020. Campbell died in 2017 at age 81 following an extended battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The 4,000-square-foot venue will feature immersive, interactive displays showcasing different stages of Campbell’s career. He was a studio musician in The Wrecking Crew; the singer of many hit records including “Rhinestone Cowboy” and “Southern Nights”; and a television and film actor. In the evenings, the museum will transform into live music venue The Rhinestone Stage, where national and local acts can perform intimate shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is coming this weekend. The Texas Comptroller’s Office says the tax break begins Friday and runs through Sunday. Customers can buy most clothing, footwear, school supplies and backpacks – sold for less than $100 – tax free from a Texas store or from an online or catalog seller doing business in the state. The sales tax exemption applies only to qualifying items. The tax break does not include products such as jewelry, handbags, briefcases, luggage, computer bags, umbrellas, wallets and watches. The Texas sales tax holiday weekend started in 1999.\n\nUtah\n\nRiverton: Administrators from more than 60 schools in northern Utah gathered ahead of the first day of classes to assemble “care kits” for students in need. The Deseret News reports administrators from the Jordan School District met Wednesday to pack more than 2,400 kits, which include food, personal hygiene products and backpacks loaded with school supplies. Walmart donated the supplies. Event organizer Peggy Margetts said the kits help students in a discrete way and show students their school cares about their well-being. Students will receive the kits at the start of school. Administrators said they will keep some on hand to use during the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets says the state’s cheese producers won 44 ribbons at the American Cheese Society’s annual awards competition. Officials say this is Vermont’s best showing yet. The results were announced at the society’s annual conference last week in Richmond, Virginia. Agriculture officials say five Vermont cheeses were finalists for the best in show. A total of 25 Vermont companies submitted cheeses to be judged among the more than 2,000 total entries. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott congratulated the state’s cheesemakers on their “impressive achievement.” He says their “commitment to excellence is helping Vermont grow its economy by creating jobs and further strengthening our great Vermont brand.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Town officials are cracking down on an unsanctioned Virginia Tech fraternity they say is operating in violation of zoning rules. Blacksburg officials recently determined the house is being used as a base for the rogue frat Omega Alpha Kappa. Zoning Administrator Paul Patterson said frat activities at the house must stop. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fraternity is not recognized by the university and was formed by members of Kappa Delta Rho when that chapter was suspended for violating alcohol policies. The fraternity has a history of trash citations and accusations that members made female guests at social events feel uncomfortable. The Roanoke Times reports the university has advised students to avoid the fraternity and seven others for their safety.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A $219 million property-tax levy that would abolish overdue fines in the Seattle Public Library system is heading toward approval. The Seattle Times reports the seven-year levy supporting the library system had 73% of the vote in returns Tuesday. The measure proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan would authorize additional property taxes and replace a $123 million library levy set to expire at the end of this year. The levy would collect about 12 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value in 2020. The additional library funding would support seismic renovations, new programs for children, more social workers, extended operating hours and the elimination of fines for overdue items. About $167 million would be used to maintain current services.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Public Port Authority board has decided to consider lease proposals and bids for the Heartland Intermodal Gateway Facility in Prichard. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board made a motion Wednesday in Charleston to delay a possible public sale. West Virginia Transportation Secretary Byrd White says the board discussed selling it because of a funding shortage. Wayne County Commissioner Jeff Maddox says the county’s economy isn’t the best, but a sale for “pennies on the dollar” would be “a grave error.” The board will further discuss options at its September meeting. The $32 million facility opened in 2015 on 76 acres donated by Norfolk Southern railroad. It’s designed to move containers more efficiently by rail through a double-stack method while offering a cheaper alternative to gas-guzzling trucks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State prison officials say they illegally released information that could reveal whether inmates are in substance abuse treatment. The Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials responding to an open records request released records June 24 that contained 1,041 inmates’ personal identification numbers and locations. No names were released, but DOC officials say someone could use the numbers and locations to learn whether an inmate is at a substance abuse facility or receiving treatment. The agency says that information is confidential under Wisconsin law. Only two people saw the information, and they’ve since confirmed the data has been destroyed. DOC spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn’t answer emailed questions asking who received the questions and what information they actually wanted.\n\nWyoming\n\nMeeteetse: A ranch where black-footed ferrets were discovered in the 1980s is being preserved. The Nature Conservancy recently announced a conservation easement agreement to restrict the Lazy BV ranch’s 2,300 acres near Meeteetse from being subdivided or developed. The ranch is in the area where the ferrets were discovered in 1981 after they were thought to be extinct. The ferrets were used to start a captive-breeding program that has restored black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and elsewhere in the western U.S. Jim Luchsinger of The Nature Conservancy tells Wyoming Public Radio it had been a dream of the ranch owners to protect the ranch and bring ferrets back. The protected land is also home to greater sage grouse, mule deer, antelope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/11/coal-miners-crawfish-offer-full-capacity-opry-news-around-states/116104458/", "title": "Coal miners, crawfish offer: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Public health officials are urging people to get COVID-19 shots as soon as possible, after the White House informed governors last week that it might reallocate supply from states with decreasing demand. Distribution has been in steady decline for several weeks, according to Alabama Department of Public Health data. “Y’all, we want shots in the arms and off the shelf,” Gov. Kay Ivey said. “If you have not made it a priority to schedule a vaccine, I encourage you to go get the shot as soon as you are able. If you are hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine, please speak to a physician you trust and ask if he or she would recommend it for you. If we don’t use it, we could lose it. This is our ticket back to normal. The vaccine is free and could possibly save your life.” In the early stages of the vaccine rollout, the Alabama Department of Public Health heavily targeted vulnerable areas, particularly those with large minority populations that have been historically underserved medically and seen disproportionately severe, deadly COVID-19 outcomes. The strategy paid off, with Alabama outperforming its neighbors earlier this year at reaching its most vulnerable citizens. The state’s highest county vaccination rates are in the Black Belt. But Alabama is now running into serious “vaccine hesitancy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials have reported that the city’s sewer system is clogging up because people are flushing wipes and other items – a problem worsened by the pandemic as people continue to spend more time at home. Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility spokesperson Sandy Baker said up to 6,000 pounds of wipes have entered the sewer system daily since the coronavirus pandemic started, Alaska’s News Source reports. “We saw a small uptick in wipes when the pandemic started,” Baker said. “But this is a year-round problem for us.” The wipes combine with grease, oils and fats, which can block pipes if not removed and even cause sewage to back up into residential neighborhoods and homes. Baker said the problem, in part, is that many brands of wipes claim to be flushable on their packaging but for practical purposes are not because they “don’t break down” after flushing. Crews have also retrieved masks, gloves, dental floss, hair and other items from sewer pipes, Baker said. “We had a surprising number of people doing extensive cleaning with toothbrushes and then flushing toothbrushes,” she said. “We had a lot of that showing up … and those are horrible for our system.” Baker urged people to be mindful of what they flush down toilets and remember the three P’s – “pee, poo and toilet paper.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An elected utility regulator has shared discredited conspiracy theories while trying to persuade energy and power providers not to require their employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Arizona Corporation Commission member Jim O’Connor said the government and news media are covering up the shots causing numerous deaths and people becoming “human vegetables,” but there’s no evidence of such problems. O’Connor, a Republican, was elected last November to his statewide office as one of five commission members. He served as a presidential elector for then-GOP nominee Donald Trump during his successful campaign in 2016. O’Connor said one source of his information was Ryan Cole, an Idaho physician who has made false and controversial statements about COVID-19. The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania debunked several of Cole’s claims about COVID-19 vaccines on its website. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the vaccines are safe. Besides mild side effects such as soreness and fever, the only serious side effects so far are very rare blood clots associated with one of the three vaccines and even rarer allergic reactions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Sluggish COVID-19 vaccination rates for prison workers are raising concerns about the state prison system’s ability to ward off disease during the pandemic’s next phase and against more-contagious variants, according to public health and incarceration experts. About 42% of the more than 4,700 employees of the Arkansas Department of Corrections have received at least one shot, an agency spokeswoman said. The corrections department set a goal of vaccinating 80% of employees after shots were offered Jan. 5, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. More than 11,300 people in Arkansas’ custody have contracted the coronavirus, and at least 49 have died, according to Department of Health data. As of May 1, Arkansas’ infection rate among prisoners was the third-highest among states, according to data compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit criminal-justice news outlet. State prisons continue to see new virus cases, with five sites reporting new cases since April 15. Department of Corrections communications director Cindy Murphy didn’t answer questions from the newspaper about why officials think COVID-19 vaccinations lag among workers. In a statement, she said the agency has been affected “more than most” institutions in the state, and workers had “stepped up once again” to get shots.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents will no longer need an appointment for COVID-19 shots at city-run inoculation sites, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Sunday. The city is prepared to administer over a quarter-million vaccinations for the second week in a row, the mayor’s office said. Last week, Los Angeles stopped requiring appointments for some walk-up and mobile locations. As of Monday, appointment-free options are available at all vaccination sites. People can still sign up ahead of time if they prefer. “We stand at a critical juncture in our fight to end this pandemic, and our City will keep doing everything possible to knock down barriers to vaccine access and deliver doses directly to all Angelenos,” Garcetti said in a statement. In addition, the city will provide nighttime appointments at three locations so residents can get vaccinated after work, officials said. At the city’s first night clinic last week, 62% of first doses were given out after 2 p.m., Garcetti’s office said. So far, 48.4% of Los Angeles County residents have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 34.8% are fully vaccinated, according to the Los Angeles Times’ vaccination tracker.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former Amazon warehouse worker has filed a complaint with the state Department of Labor and Employment against Amazon over its COVID-19 policies and allegations that her firing was retaliatory. Linda Rodriguez alleged in her complaint filed Thursday that Amazon fired her in 2020 because she raised concerns about the company’s policies and practices. She said they put Thornton, Colorado, warehouse workers at risk amid the spread of the coronavirus, according to the complaint sent to the agency’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics. The complaint said Rodriguez was fired “for speaking out” after she raised concerns that Amazon was providing health information only in English even though many workers in the facility only speak Spanish and “felt extraordinary pressure to continue coming to work every day, even if they were sick.” In response to the complaint, an Amazon spokesperson said Rodriguez was not fired for speaking publicly but for “timecard fraud” or “time theft,” which they said was confirmed by time records and video footage. Amazon also said that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a federal agency that regulates companies to ensure safe working conditions, confirmed Rodriguez withdrew a complaint filed with the federal agency in early December 2020.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Of the more than 1.4 million residents who are now fully vaccinated, 242 later became infected with COVID-19, according to data released Friday by the state Department of Public Health. Among the 242 so-called vaccine breakthrough cases, 109 people had no symptoms of the disease. DPH reported three deaths among vaccinated individuals who were confirmed to have had underlying medical conditions. All were over 55 years old. Nationally, there have been 132 vaccine breakthrough deaths, DPH said. “The main takeaway is that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and cases of infection after a person is fully vaccinated are very rare,” Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state’s acting public health commissioner, said in a statement. The percentage of cases of COVID-19 in fully vaccinated individuals in Connecticut is less than 0.1%, according to the DPH data. “The best protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 is vaccination, and I strongly urge all eligible Connecticut residents who have not yet gotten vaccinated to do so,” Gifford said. Release of the breakthrough case data comes as more than 50% of Connecticut residents age 16 and older are now fully vaccinated.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As demand returns for activities that were put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses say they are struggling to hire workers. “What we are hearing, of course, are a need for workers to fill unfilled jobs,” said Rachel Turney, deputy secretary at the Delaware Department of Labor. The pandemic-era unemployment system could be contributing to the lack of job-seekers for lower-paying positions thanks to Congress extending extra federal unemployment benefits and the state labor department halting the requirement that beneficiaries actively look for work. Office of Occupational and Labor Market Information Chief Thomas Dougherty said businesses struggling to hire could raise wages in order to compete with unemployment benefits. “When you have the wage going up, you also attract more workers to either enter the labor market or ... attract them from another industry, or maybe attract them from another state,” he said. “If I’m making such and such money from unemployment insurance, I’m reluctant to take a job that pays the same or less.” Democrats in the General Assembly are trying to pass a $15 minimum wage, gradually raising it from the current $9.25 over the course of several years. But many business representatives oppose the measure.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. will lift most COVID-19 restrictions and capacity limits starting May 21 following “dramatic” improvements in health metrics in the city, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Monday that restrictions on public and commercial activities – including capacity limits, types of activities and time restrictions – will be lifted across the city May 21. But the loosening of restrictions excludes bars, nightclubs, and large sports or music venues, which will operate at 50% capacity. Bowser said starting June 11, restrictions will be lifted for all establishments and venues in the district. D.C. will continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s mask guidance. That means wearing masks will still be required, Bowser said. City health officials said community spread of the coronavirus is decreasing after peaking in January. She said the district is going in the right direction when it comes to COVID-19 cases and vaccinations., and residents and businesses have outperformed the metrics. “I am proud of D.C. residents who have followed health guidance, and we see it in the numbers,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Local vaccination clinics have noticed a slowdown in demand for COVID-19 shots. “People who were eager to get vaccinated have been vaccinated,” said Dr. Temple Robinson, CEO of the Bond Community Health Center. “Now we really need to turn our attention to (the) people who are still deciding when or if they want to get vaccinated.” Leon County health officials say the observed vaccination fatigue is concerning and concentrated among young adults. Included in that demographic are nearly 70,000 students who attend local colleges. Despite students residing in Tallahassee for school, they are counted among Leon County’s population for COVID-19 statistics, according to the Florida Department of Health. This pattern holds true across the state. Florida has fully vaccinated about 31% of its adult population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “My concern is the 18-35 population is showing a little more hesitancy than I would have expected early on,” Robinson said, adding that the 65-and-older population has been more eager to get vaccinated. Of the more than 93,000 locals vaccinated, state data shows that only about 8,240 are between the ages of 16 and 24.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s elected labor commissioner said he intends to reinstate the requirement that people must actively search for work to receive unemployment benefits “in the next few months.” Republican Mark Butler didn’t say exactly when the job-search requirement would return. Butler said last week that those getting benefits would get notice of the change. Georgia and most other states suspended job-search requirements to cut down on COVID-19 exposure. Butler said his department is shifting its focus from paying benefits to encouraging recipients to find new jobs. He said employers have 240,000 jobs listed with the state, and the department provides job-search assistance, career counseling and skills testing. “I hear every day from employers who have been forced to reduce business hours, refuse large deliveries, and turn down economic opportunities due to the simple fact that they did not have the staff to support them,” Butler said in a statement. He said hotels and restaurants have particularly critical labor needs. Some officials and business owners have called for ending a $300-a-week federal unemployment supplement, saying it allows too many workers to afford to stay home. However, defenders of the measure say the labor market is still disrupted by COVID-19, particularly among those with children.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is leading the nation in vaccinating its adult population against COVID-19, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Lt. Gov. Josh Green told the outlet that with 70% of residents 18 and up having received at least one dose of a vaccine, Hawaii is ahead of the rest of the United States, taking the No. 1 spot. The state has been seeing daily new coronavirus cases in the high double-digits but expects to see that number drop further as the Aloha State pushes further toward herd immunity, Green said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Department of Health and Welfare is offering funding to groups to establish and operate mobile, off-site, walk-in and special COVID-19 vaccination clinics in underserved populations. That includes communities of high social vulnerabilities, racial and ethnic minority populations, and rural communities, among others. A total of $9 million is available on a first-come, first-served basis to enrolled vaccine providers, who can apply for funding online. Grant money can be used for any COVID-19 vaccine services the recipient provides outside their usual, appointment-based clinics. Examples include, but are not limited to, in-home vaccination for homebound individuals; clinics joined with community and job fairs; and walk-up sites at pharmacies, shopping centers, places of worship, colleges and universities, salons, and other locations. An initial funding cap of $500,000 per applicant will apply for the funding opportunity. Eligible applicants must either be currently enrolled as an Idaho COVID-19 vaccine provider or partner with an enrolled Idaho COVID-19 vaccine provider to administer the clinic.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials on Sunday reported 1,741 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 30 additional deaths. The Illinois Department of Public Health is reporting a total of 1.35 million coronavirus cases in Illinois, including 22,223 deaths, since the start of the pandemic. As of late Saturday, 1,870 people were hospitalized in the state due to COVID-19. Of those, 452 were in intensive care units, and 232 were on ventilators. The preliminary seven-day statewide test positivity rate is 3.4%. A total of 9,908,489 vaccines have been injected into the arms of Illinois residents since mid-December, and 35% of the state’s population, about 4.5 million, is fully vaccinated, according to the public health department.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Advocates for nursing home residents say they worry a new state law expanding COVID-19 liability protections for health care providers will effectively block many lawsuits over neglect and substandard treatment that weren’t caused by the pandemic. The law, which applies retroactively to when Indiana’s first COVID-19 infections were reported in March 2020, was sought by the nursing home industry, which argues it will keep facilities financially viable by shielding them from a potential flood of coronavirus-related lawsuits. Critics of the law, however, maintain it lets nursing homes escape responsibility for deaths and injuries caused by problems that preceded the pandemic, such as inadequate staffing. The new law protects health care providers against any claims “arising from COVID-19.” The definition of that phrase includes the reallocation of staff, delaying or modifying nonemergency medical services, and reasonable nonperformance of medical services due to COVID-19. The measure doesn’t prevent lawsuits over “gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct,” but trial lawyers warn those are virtually impossible to prove. Jody Madeira, a professor who teaches medical law at Indiana University, said the law provides a way for nursing homes to make mistreatment claims go away.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: Gov. Kim Reynolds has removed the chief executive of the state’s nursing home for veterans and their spouses, months after praising his response to the coronavirus pandemic, her office said Monday. Reynolds’ spokesman, Pat Garrett, said Timon Oujiri was “relieved of his duties” as commandant of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown last week. He offered no additional information on the leadership change at the facility, which is Iowa’s largest nursing home. Reynolds appointed Oujiri as commandant in 2017, and the Iowa Senate confirmed him in 2018. In his role, he oversaw one of the nation’s largest state-owned nursing homes for veterans, with about 500 residents and 900 employees. In December, the governor appeared with Oujiri at one of her news conferences and praised the work he had done protecting the home’s staff and residents during the pandemic. “You and your team have done such an outstanding job,” Reynolds said. “Job well done.” Oujiri, 63, returned the support, saying the governor had ensured the home had adequate personal protective equipment and testing supplies. He said then that 21 of the home’s residents tested positive for the coronavirus in 2020 and that five of them died.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Identity theft rose sharply last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no place was hit harder than the Sunflower State. The Wichita Eagle reports that 43,211 Kansans alerted the Federal Trade Commission in 2020 that someone had stolen or tried to steal their identity. That was 2,272 more cases than in 2019. Kansas’ 1,802% year-over-year increase was the highest among the states and more than three times the national average. Rhode Island was next, with an increase of 1,002%. Of all the 2020 identity theft reports in Kansas, 88% were classified as government documents or benefits fraud. The Kansas Department of Labor has cited a barrage of fraudulent unemployment claims since the coronavirus pandemic began.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Those who get a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at a Kroger or Walmart may be able to get in on a major cash prize. The Kentucky Lottery announced Monday that, starting immediately, people 18 or older who get a first or second dose of the vaccine at more than 170 Kroger and Walmart locations across the state will receive a coupon for a free CashBall 225 ticket. The top prize in the nightly CashBall game is $225,000, according to the Kentucky Lottery. This announcement comes as public officials in the Bluegrass State continue to urge Kentuckians to receive a COVID-19 shot. As of Sunday, 1,867,037 Kentuckians – or 42% of the commonwealth’s population – have been vaccinated. At recent press briefings, Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has said that he will be announcing incentives to encourage people to get the vaccine.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A pound of crawfish is being promised to lure people to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The city is partnering with the local nonprofit Go Propeller to give the vaccines and crawfish from The Original Cajun Seafood on Thursday, WVUE-TV reports. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be available during the event, along with food, music and gift card giveaways, officials said. The crawfish giveaway is one of many different ways health officials and businesses have been encouraging people to get vaccinated. In recent weeks various bars have held “shots for shots” events where people who get vaccinated can get a free shot of booze, while other events have featured music or fish fry giveaways.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposal from a group of Republicans to ban mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for five years is up for consideration by a legislative committee this week. The lawmakers, led by Rep. Tracy Quint, R-Hodgdon, have based their proposal in part on the theory that the vaccines cause reproductive harm. Numerous medical authorities have said the claim lacks merit, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is “no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines affect future fertility.” The proposal is slated for a work session before the Legislature’s Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services on Tuesday. The bill says it “prohibits mandatory vaccinations for coronavirus disease 2019 for 5 years from the date of a vaccine’s first emergency use authorization by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration in order to allow for safety testing and investigations into reproductive harm.” Maine authorities are not currently considering any proposals that would make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for residents. More than 52% of the eligible people in the state have been fully vaccinated, state officials said Monday. Maine was one of the first states in the country to surpass the 50% threshold.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: While taking note of current health threats, a bit of the past will roll through Washington County next weekend. After missing last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Pike Festival and James Shaull Wagon Train will return. “This year, obviously, is going to be different,” said Chad Walker, the organization’s secretary and treasurer. Even though it’s an outdoor event, face coverings will be required because of ongoing COVID-19 concerns. Visitors will be able to pet horses at the stops, Walker said, but they should wear masks. “As well, we’re going to practice social distancing where possible,” he said. The event celebrates the past and tries to educate people about what life was like when it took an hour or so just to hitch up a buggy and prepare for a trip to town. The National Pike Festival commemorates what was once the major route west. Different communities celebrate in different ways. The James Shaull Wagon Train is a nod to Shaull, who farmed with Belgian horses and participated in annual wagon trains and parades. He died in a tractor accident. “He thought it was important to educate the public on how it was to live back then,” Walker said. The wagon train will set off Friday afternoon from Plumb Grove and end Sunday morning in Boonsboro.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s famous Swan Boats are again offering rides after being sidelined last year because of the pandemic. Acting Mayor Kim Janey took her family on one of the foot-powered boats Saturday to celebrate their reopening at the Boston Public Garden. Janey called it “a great way to celebrate our recovery from the pandemic.” “We welcome Bostonians and visitors back to our historic park to enjoy this joyful attraction in keeping with current health guidelines for a safe ride with family and friends,” she said in a statement. Masks are required on the boats, and passengers are being spaced apart in line and on the vessels. The Paget family, which has run the iconic Boston tradition since 1877, said last summer was the first time the entire season had been canceled. The oldest boat in the fleet just celebrated its 111th season. Each Swan Boat weighs 3 tons fully laden and is powered by the driver using a foot-propelled paddle wheel.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state said late Friday that 54% of residents ages 16 and up have gotten at least one COVID-19 shot, a roughly 2.5 percentage point jump after factoring in people who were vaccinated outside the state or at federal facilities. The addition of nearly 227,000 residents to the state’s count put Michigan close to a 55% benchmark Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said is needed to allow in-person work in all sectors, including offices. The reopening step will occur two weeks after the milestone is reached. State officials said a new tracker uses data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can access data from out-of-state providers and federal entities like veterans hospitals. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief deputy for health, said the “Vacc to Normal” tracker provides the most complete vaccination estimate. Nearly 4.4 million Michiganders, 53.9%, ages 16 and older have received one dose. That is higher than 51.5% that was shown on the state’s regular vaccine dashboard Friday. The state health department urged people who were vaccinated in another state to bring their card to their next doctor’s appointment or to their local health department so that their immunization information is updated in the Michigan Care Improvement Registry.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials are trying a range of strategies in an attempt to get people vaccinated and slow the spread of the coronavirus. Volunteer physicians are working with a brewery in St. Paul on a pop-up event that rewards those who get shots with a free beer. Vaccinations are being offered in the downtown bus depot in Duluth. An Elk River clinic is offering shots to patients who are seeking help for other health care needs. Officials are hoping the creativity pays off. Since early April, the statewide average for first COVID-19 vaccine doses administered has fallen from about 40,000 per day to fewer than 14,000 at the end of last week, the Star Tribune reports. “We’re seeing a shift now from the earlier phases of vaccination, where there were folks very eager to get the vaccine and able to go to, sometimes, pretty extraordinary lengths to go find the vaccine wherever it was,” said Jan Malcolm, the state health commissioner. “Now we’re in a situation where we’ve got plenty of vaccine supply, and we need to reach those folks and make it more convenient for them.” Gov. Tim Walz has announced the state’s indoor mask mandate will end July 1 but said it could be lifted sooner if 70% of those age 16 and older receive first doses. That would equal more than 3 million people.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: A hospice care center is working to brighten patients’ pandemic-darkened days with good deeds. Wishing Well Project was started at SouthernCare Hospice in Picayune. “If there’s something specific that will just brighten their day, cheer them up and give them a couple of good memories is what we try to do,” Coordinator Rebecca Silvia told WLOX. The TV outlet reports Nola King of Bay St. Louis just had her garden restored. When she was younger, she used to spend all her time in the garden. “I got garden of the month twice,” King told WLOX. “I’ve had a lawnmower; I weeded my flower beds; I made my flower beds. I’ve done it all.” But lately, King said she has not been able to work in her garden at the house where she’s lived for more than 70 years due to her health. “I miss it so much,” King told the television station. “Gardening helps you grow. I’ve read that plants are the best thing you could do when you’re older.” Silvia said the organization relies on volunteers to complete patients’ wishes, and they’re always looking for more. “I’m always a little surprised at the turnout,” she said. “When you reach out to the need of folks, especially in Bay St. Louis, they just turn up. Especially after a tough year of COVID, it’s nice to see people being nice.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Springfield Public Schools’ summer program is finding a new balance this year. Explore’s offerings for elementary and middle school will largely resemble the courses before the pandemic, with a few changes and extra precautions. High school courses will be almost entirely online. Dana Hubbard, director of summer learning and student experiences, said seated or in-person learning will be an option for kindergarten through eighth grade. “We are really hopeful that we can get our families reengaged in that way,” she said. In a nod to the pandemic, there will also be a virtual learning option for elementary and middle school students. “The new thing we bring with us, after a year of COVID and shifting, is we will also have – starting with first grade all the way through eighth grade – online options for courses,” she said. Elementary courses, in-person and virtual, include “Route 66 Road Trip” and the Earth Explorers. The seated-only courses include Explore Diversity, Life Lab, and the STEAM Works. Hubbard said Central High School will have in-person classes for students with special needs, students with limited English skills, and individuals significantly lagging behind their peers academically. The district will offer two sessions of Explore, one June 7-30 and the second July 7-30.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A nonprofit plans to open a slaughterhouse that will kill and process cattle donated for food banks. The $2.5 million Producer Partnership plant outside Livingston will be able to process 300 animals per month by next year, the Billings Gazette reports. Ranchers who donate cattle for food banks will have access to the processing plant for their own retail sales. The Producer Partnership formed last year to help struggling communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership has donated 80,000 pounds of hamburger in the past year and is shooting for 140,000 pounds a year. The group has struggled to secure space at slaughterhouses, however, limiting how many donated animals it can accept. “We’ve been trying to get kill dates at different plants. That proved to be hard to find a kill date in the first place, and then we wound up with so many animals donated that we couldn’t find enough dates,” said Mayzie Purviance, Producer Partnership program administrator. The processing plant will be federally inspected, meaning ranchers who choose to use the facility for direct retail sales will be able to ship meat out of state, Purviance said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state will issue emergency payments Tuesday to residents who received food stamp benefits in April as part of the federal pandemic assistance law, state officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said it will issue the payments through Sept. 30 to comply with the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law earlier this year by President Joe Biden. Recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will not have to take any action to get the extra support because the increased benefits will go directly to their EBT cards. Under the law, all SNAP households must receive a minimum of $95 in emergency allotments.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. is postponing plans to sell one of its eight Las Vegas Strip resorts until the market further rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps next year, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Caesars officials have said since the company’s merger with Eldorado Resorts that they plan to sell a Strip asset. “We remain convinced that it does not make sense for us to market an asset until we can market it off the cash flow that we’re doing with it, not off a bridge to what we think we can do with it,” Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said. He said it’s possible a sale could happen in 2022. A potential buyer, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, looked at a Strip property before coming to terms on a $650 million deal announced last week to buy the Palms, according to its CEO, Laurens Vosloo, who declined to say which Strip property the band was considering. Caesars posted a net loss of $423 million for the first quarter of the year after collecting $1.7 billion in net revenues for the three months that ended March 31. The company recorded a net loss of $173 million during the first quarter of 2020. Caesars officials said they expect business in Las Vegas will continue to improve as the year goes on.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials expect spending on summer tourism to rebound to near 2019 levels. The state Division of Travel and Tourism Development is predicting there will be nearly 3.5 million visitors to New Hampshire this summer, with spending reaching $1.8 billion. Summer is typically the busiest season for tourism in the state. Last summer, visitation dropped 15% because of the pandemic. But officials expect a rebound based on pent-up demand for travel and the state’s high vaccination rate, strong economy and tourism assets. The state is launching a summer advertising campaign targeting Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio, said Lori Harnois, state tourism director. She said the emphasis will be on hiking, boating, camping and family fun. “We expect this to be a summer of discovery and rediscovery for visitors,” Harnois said. “Our message is to come, explore everything we have to offer, and Discover Your New in New Hampshire.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy will set aside $275million to help small businesses and individuals affected by COVID-19, including $40 million in federal funds for undocumented immigrants and others left out of previous pandemic relief. Murphy announced the funding in a statement Friday and said much of the $235 million in small-business assistance would go toward bars and restaurants, child care centers and others hard hit by a year of coronavirus lockdowns. State lawmakers would still have to approve that pot, but Murphy said legislative leaders are already on board. Cash payments for individuals, meanwhile, would come out of federal stimulus funds over which Murphy has control, the administration said. The money would help New Jerseyans who suffered relatively short periods of unemployment as well as undocumented immigrants, who’ve been largely ineligible for trillions of dollars in federal relief payments as well as state unemployment over the past year. “COVID-19 has created unimaginable challenges for our economy over the past year,” Murphy said. “As we emerge from this pandemic, we need to make targeted investments in both our small businesses and our workforce to lay the foundation for a stronger and fairer future that works for everyone.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state has set a record for the highest monthly royalty earnings from oil and gas leases, according to state officials. The State Land Office reported that nearly $110 million was earned in April – more than any month in state history. The previous record was nearly $109 million in February 2020, just before a global price war and pandemic market forces disrupted the oil industry. Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said the revenue boon will benefit public schools, hospitals and other programs that are funded by drilling and other development on state trust land. Revenue from activities on trust land on average saves the typical New Mexico household an estimated $1,500 per year in taxes that would otherwise be needed to fund state operations, Garcia Richard said. “This is a huge monetary relief for hard working New Mexico families, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic,” she said in a statement. While oil and gas is a driving force of New Mexico’s economy and the state budget, the Democratic land commissioner said the resources are finite and aren’t a stable long-term budgeting tool for the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A political candidate who led protests against coronavirus restrictions in Brooklyn last fall will avoid jail time after pleading guilty Friday to a charge of inciting a riot. Harold “Heshy” Tischler was sentenced to 10 days of community service for egging on a crowd of men that chased and trapped a journalist during the Oct. 7 protest in the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park. Video showed the men surrounding, jostling and taunting Jacob Kornbluh, who had been reporting on resistance to social distancing in the neighborhood. Tischler, not wearing a mask, could be seen screaming in Kornbluh’s face. Kornbluh, who is also an Orthodox Jew, said he was struck and kicked during the incident. Kornbluh was reporting for Jewish Insider at the time and now writes for the Jewish newspaper The Forward. Tischler, an activist and City Council candidate, posted a video on Twitter after his court appearance praising his lawyers who “saved me” and showing himself behind the counter with supporters at a local pizza parlor. Kornbluh tweeted that he welcomed Tischler’s acknowledgment in court “that he incited a riot against me and has been held accountable for his actions. I am looking forward to continuing my work in journalism undeterred.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lawmakers are pressing to ensure that patients at health care facilities can receive visits from family member and clergy, especially during future emergencies. Last week the state Senate and House approved separate measures designed to address situations where patients lacked access to a minister or visits from family during last year’s COVID-19 restrictions and later died. The Senate’s “No Patient Left Behind” bill, approved on a 40-9 vote, tells hospitals and hospice care, nursing home and residential treatment facilities to allow patients to receive visitors to the fullest extent permitted by federal Medicaid and Medicare rules and regulations. If they don’t, the health care facilities will receive a warning. Those who don’t allow visitors within 24 hours of the warning will face minimum daily fines of $500 per incident. Similar rules apply to adult care homes. The House voted 98-19 for a measure directing state-licensed hospitals to allow a clergy member to visit any patient who requests one. A cleric may be subject to health screenings and could be turned away if he or she fails to pass that screening or tests positive for an infectious disease. Each bill still must pass the opposite chamber before being sent to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An annual report using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the state’s rate of workplace deaths remains among the highest in the country. The annual report released by the AFL-CIO shows that 37 North Dakota workers died in 2019 due to on-the-job injuries. The rate of 9.7 deaths per 100,000 workers was the third-highest in the nation, behind Alaska and Wyoming, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “This year’s report is yet another reminder of the dangers facing working people in North Dakota every single day,” North Dakota AFL-CIO President Landis Larson said in a statement. “Now with COVID-19, it’s more important than ever to protect working people.” Nationally in 2019, 5,333 workers were killed on the job, and an estimated 90,000 died from occupational diseases. The overall rate of fatal job injuries was 2.8 per 100,000. according to the labor union federation. It’s the the 30th year the AFL-CIO has released the findings on the state of safety and health protections for workers across the country. North Dakota’s ranking has changed little in recent years. In 2016, the state had 28 workplace deaths and ranked fifth in the nation; in 2017, the state had 38 deaths and ranked second; and in 2018, it had 35 deaths and ranked third.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state will take only 20% of the COVID-19 vaccine doses allocated to it this week amid slumping demand. Ohio was allocated 324,960 first doses this week. The state has ordered just 65,370 first doses to arrive this week, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman said Monday. More could be used this week: The state is banking 139,230 doses of the Pfizer vaccine for use in children ages 12 to 15, once the vaccine receives emergency approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. That’s expected as soon as this week. Those doses will be stored with the rest of Ohio’s stockpile at the federal level. As of last week, Ohio had stockpiled 480,180 first COVID-19 vaccine doses – about 10% of the total number of first doses administered statewide. “Vaccine is precious,” health department spokeswoman Alicia Shoults wrote in an email. “Many providers in Ohio have adequate vaccine supply on hand and requested that additional doses not be shipped to them the week of May 10.” Last week, White House officials said states could request a smaller or larger number of doses than what was allocated to them. Unordered doses could be contributed to a national pool to divert to states and programs in need of more vaccine.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The latest flu season has been especially mild, and experts say COVID-19 precautions likely played a role in keeping the numbers down. Across the state, 221 flu-associated hospitalizations and 10 deaths were reported so far during the 2020-21 season – the lowest numbers in years, aligning with trends across the country. During the previous flu season, 3,580 hospitalizations and 85 deaths were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Masks and social distancing were likely a major factor in keeping the flu at bay this year, said Dr. David Chansolme, medical director of infection prevention with Integris Health. “As people have really questioned the science behind masks, to me, the lack of a significant flu season is the most verification that you need,” Chansolme said. During a presentation at a recent Healthier Oklahoma Coalition news conference, MyHealth Access Network founder and CEO Dr. David Kendrick said there was a significant difference in flu positivity rates in communities where masks were required versus where they weren’t. There are likely other factors, too, Chansolme said: a relative lack of crowds, more people working from home than usual – even fist-bumps versus handshakes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s mass vaccination site is expected to close June 19 after giving hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 shots, organizers said Monday. The All4Oregon site, which was set up by four of Portland’s major hospitals in a joint vaccination effort, has been running since Jan. 20 at the Oregon Convention Center. The site began offering self-scheduling and walk-in appointments for the first time last week, but organizers said a drop in volume made it clear that demand for a mass vaccination site is waning as shots become more widely available elsewhere. Many retail pharmacies now offer walk-in appointments, and health providers are shifting their focus to smaller neighborhood- and community-targeted vaccination efforts as supply begins to outstrip demand for the doses. All4Oregon will offer stop offering first doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine May 27 and will offer second doses only in June. It expects to close completely June 19. The clinic only offers Pfizer. As of Friday, the site had administered 465,000 shots. Oregon has now administered more than 3.3 million doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines statewide, and nearly 2 million Oregonians have received at least one dose, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As federal agencies stand poised to approve COVID-19 vaccines for children 12 to 15, a Montgomery County state legislator is planning to introduce a bill that would allow those 14 and older to consent to receiving federally recommended immunizations without parental approval. Democratic state Sen. Amanda Cappelletti said in a co-sponsorship memo circulated that the legislation would mirror the state’s mental health law that allows minors 14 and older to consent to inpatient mental health treatment. Cappelletti wrote that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended immunizations for children and adolescents that include “vaccines that have been proven to be safe, effective, and necessary to protect and promote public health” and that minors should be able to consent to receive them. According to the CDC, everyone 16 and over is now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Cappelletti offered statistics from the World Health Organization that showed vaccinations prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths annually, and 1.5 million more deaths could be prevented if vaccination numbers are improved.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The mental health and education of the state’s children suffered greatly last year during the coronavirus pandemic, and children of color were the hardest-hit, according to data released Monday by Kids Count, the national child advocacy nonprofit. “Unacceptable gaps continue to exist between children of color and white children in nearly every Factbook indicator,” Rhode Island Kids Count executive director Elizabeth Burke Bryant said. “These gaps have persisted because of systemic racism and barriers to opportunity that must be addressed and dismantled to ensure that every child can succeed. The COVID-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on stark economic, education, and other disparities and challenges to children’s success.” The number of calls to Kids Link RI, a 24-hour emergency mental health and behavioral referral network, was up 22% in 2020 from the previous year, the organization said. The number of children enrolled in kindergarten, considered a critical first step toward fluency in reading and writing, dropped 11% in 2020 from the previous year, similar to national trends as families kept their youngest home or waited for schools to open in person.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nPickens: Pickens County is planning to pay charities and civic groups $250 a mile for cleaning up litter. The county has set aside $75,000 in COVID-19 relief funding for the program, enough to clean up 300 miles, said County Councilman Roy Costner III. The program is designed to help struggling groups that have been unable to do their usual fundraising during the pandemic, Costner said. It would also be a way to use relief money aimed at helping communities, without having officials pick and choose which organizations get the relief, he said. The program aims to clean up at least 25% of the county’s roads while supporting local organizations and businesses, said Jamie Burns, a spokeswoman for the county. It’s a big step in a years­long effort to fight litter, said Chris Bowers, council chairman. Pick Up Pickens is believed to be the first program of its kind in the state, and using pandemic money for this could be a first in the nation, Burns said. Political groups and candidates aren’t eligible, before-and-after photos must show that the area was cleaned, and there would be a limit on how many miles each group handles. The plan is promising and could serve as a model for other counties in the state, said Sarah Lyles, executive director of Palmetto Pride, the state’s anti-litter organization.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two state agencies, the Department of Labor and Regulation and the Department of Tourism, are partnering together to help fill jobs in the tourism industry. Businesses are encouraged to post their job openings on SDWORKS, according to a news release. The database has more than 23,000 job openings. “The success of our tourism industry is a major factor in South Dakota’s economic health,” Gov. Kristi Noem said in the release. “South Dakota’s economic success has led to the lowest unemployment rate in America. While that is excellent news, we have more job openings than workers to fill them – especially in travel and tourism.” Noem initially announced the tourism workforce recruitment campaign at a press conference at Mount Rushmore on May 3 to kick off National Travel & Tourism Week. In 2020, a total of 49,500 jobs were supported by the tourism industry, representing 1 in 12 jobs in South Dakota, the release said. Those jobs include full-time, part-time and seasonal positions. South Dakota expects an increased amount of visitation to the state in 2021 due to a demand for travel and the state remaining open for business amid the pandemic, the release said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two major venues will soon lift capacity restrictions as the city continues to reopen from limitations implemented on businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. News outlets report that Nashville Soccer Club will open at near capacity for its May 23 match. Face coverings will still be encouraged but not required for outdoors. Meanwhile, Grand Ole Opry will begin weekly performances at full capacity Friday for the first time in more than a year. The indoor mask mandate will remain in place. That night’s show will include Opry members Lorrie Morgan and the Oak Ridge Boys. Earlier this year, Nashville officials announced that on May 14 the city would lift all COVID-19 restrictions, except for an indoor mask mandate. The city decided to ease the limits after the COVID-19 vaccine had been available to all adults for several weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Don Huffines, a former state senator from Dallas who has sharply criticized the state’s handling of the pandemic, said Monday that he will challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022. Huffines is a wealthy businessman who has spent the past year rallying with conservative activists around Texas, including outside the governor’s mansion in October. Abbott, who did not have a serious primary challenger in his first two campaigns for governor, has faced pressure from within his party over COVID-19 closures and a statewide mask mandate. Huffines, who served one term in the Senate before losing his seat in 2018 to Democrat Nathan Johnson, did not mention Abbott in his announcement. “Plain and simple, our politicians aren’t getting things done, and Texans have rightfully run out of patience,” Huffines said. Abbott reported having nearly $38 million in his campaign account in January, and his prolific fundraising has been a major obstacle for previous challengers. A Democratic challenger to Abbott next year has yet to emerge, although former congressman Beto O’Rourke has not ruled out running. Actor Matthew McConaughey is also flirting with a run for governor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported 2,340 new coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, down 9.3% from the previous week. Utah ranked 31st among the states where the virus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Across Utah, cases fell in five counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Tooele counties. Meanwhile, the state ranked 34th in the nation in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 40.9% of its residents at least partially inoculated. The national rate is 45.8%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 95,682 vaccine doses, including 37,389 first doses. In the previous week, the state administered 132,249 vaccine doses, including 56,176 first doses. In all, Utah reported it has administered 2,263,595 total doses. Within Utah, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in San Juan, Davis and Summit counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Salt Lake County, with 855 cases; Utah County, with 460 cases; and Davis County, with 296. Across the state, 20 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. In the week before that, 22 people were reported dead.\n\nVermont\n\nVernon: The town is planning to hold its annual town meeting outdoors this year. Earlier this year the Vernon select board moved the community’s town meeting, which is usually held in March, to May 23 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The whole process will be new, but as far as what they’re voting on, should be pretty much the same,” said interim town administrator Wendy Harrison. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the meeting is scheduled for 2 p.m. on May 23 on the lawn outside the town hall. In addition to masking, participants will answer health-related questions upon checking in. Social distancing rules also will be applied. No food sales or table leafletting will be allowed. At the meeting, townspeople will decide a number of economic issues for the community.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: Petersburg Area Transit riders can expect free fares for at least the next year, officials say. The influx of federal funding from the coronavirus relief package passed in March 2020 and other federal dollars allow PAT to ensure free rides until the end of the 2021-22 fiscal year. “We’ve already balanced our budget without the revenue from free fares,” said Charles Koonce Jr., transit general manager for PAT. Free bus fares have been offered since March 2020. Ridership has decreased about 40% since the start of the pandemic, according to Koonce. Nearby localities have followed suit in providing free fares for riders in efforts to protect everyone on board. Greater Richmond Transit Company will operate under free fares until the end of the next fiscal year and hold a board meeting to see whether to continue the free fares the following year. Charlottesville promised its residents zero fares for the next three years. The Commonwealth Transportation Board allocated $3.5 million of the $456 million it received from the first pandemic relief package passed by Congress. A portion of the funds went into purchasing personal protective equipment for all employees and increasing custodial operations.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: More people in the state died of drug overdoses in 2020 than any other year in at least the last decade, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic likely led to a surge in drug use, the department said. The Seattle Times reports fatal drug overdoses increased more than 30% last year compared to 2019, according to the data, marking an increase more than twice as large as any other year in the past decade. Deadly opioid overdoses – from prescription painkillers, heroin, fentanyl and other similar substances – increased even faster, by nearly 40%, according to the data. That represented more than triple the rate of any other increase in the past decade. The Department of Health is still analyzing the preliminary data and causes of death in specific cases, and state health officials expect the number of overdose deaths to grow even higher. “It is reasonable to believe the psychological, social and economic impacts of COVID-19 led to an increase in drug use,” said Kristen Maki, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health. In 2020 the health department reported 1,649 drug overdose deaths, compared with 1,259 the previous year. Many more people reached out for help with drug or alcohol problems during 2020, according to state data.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKanawha County: A clinic formed in 1973 to care for and serve families in the region’s mining communities has been working to vaccinate coal miners against COVID-19. Dr. Jessica McColley, head of medical services at Cabin Creek Health Systems, said she and her colleagues show up at the mines between shifts and catch workers coming and going, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. McColley called the working environment for coal miners “great for an airborne virus.” Underground miners often work in small, low-airflow areas with several other people for extended periods of time. Researchers are learning more about the coronavirus and its variant strains every day, but they agree the lungs are often the main organs affected. “That’s one of the most significant effects we’ve seen from COVID-19,” said Dr. Rayan Ihle, a critical care pulmonologist with Charleston Area Medical Center. Many coal miners already suffer from preexisting lung conditions, such as black lung disease or COPD, Ihle said. COVID-19 poses a serious health risk to miners, Ihle said, and the best protection is a vaccine. “Coal miners ... should really be on the forefront and standing in the front of the line to protect themselves,” Ihle said. “But vaccination not only helps that individual patient not contract (the virus); it protects others. It’s almost a civic duty.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nAppleton: The Fox Cities Exhibition Center vaccine clinic is partnering with three local breweries – Appleton Beer Factory, McFleshman’s and Stone Arch Brewpub – to launch a “Shot and a Beer” campaign to encourage people to get immunized against COVID-19. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the clinic will administer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. People who get their shot will also get a coupon for a free beer at one of the breweries. The coupon may not be redeemed until June, as it takes about 15 days after the J&J vaccine for people to build full immunity to the disease caused by the coronavirus. Those who are under 21 can redeem the coupon for a free root beer or other soda. Residents can make an appointment online at foxcitiescovidvaccine.com or walk in to the clinic without an appointment. The exhibition center clinic will close at the end of May.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state is reopening nine rest stops that were closed last year due to budget cuts, Gov. Mark Gordon said. The state plans to open the locations before the Memorial Day holiday weekend and keep them open at least through this year’s tourism season, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. “With the summer season just around the corner, I’m glad we will be able to reopen these facilities to travelers,” Gordon said in a statement Thursday. “We are glad to have this chance to find a temporary solution.” The rest stops were closed last June in the first budget cuts enacted amid declining revenues caused by the energy slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. The closures were expected to save the state more than $700,000. Gordon said he would work to get federal money to reopen the rest areas. The rest stops that are reopening are near Lusk, Guernsey, Greybull, Moorcroft, Star Valley, Sundance, Upton, Orin Junction and Chugwater.

Duolingo. Here's why.", "text": "Language learning app Duolingo has seen an over 200% spike in U.S. users learning Mandarin \"out of spite\" as many flee to Chinese app RedNote amid the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the decision to ban TikTok in the U.S. On Thursday, TikTok had indicated it was preparing to shut the app down come Sunday if the court ruled against them. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has said he wouldn't enforce the ban, leaving a decision to President-elect Donald Trump. So while it's still unclear what could happen to TikTok this weekend, social media users are already finding their way to other apps, like RedNote.\n\nAmong all free iPhone apps, RedNote, known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese, is currently the top social networking app on the Apple App Store. Many TikTok fans angry about the potential ban took to the platform while searching for alternatives, reveling in the irony of flooding a Chinese-language, Chinese-based app with American users (and data) in response to the U.S. government's concerns about U.S. data filtering through TikTok to Chinese parent company ByteDance.\n\nIt has become something of a meme to hop onto RedNote, with many joking they are looking for a \"new Chinese spy\" or saying \"We'll make SURE they have our data now.\"\n\nSimilarweb, a digital market intelligence company, reported Thursday that RedNote has 3.4 million daily active users on iOS and Android in the U.S., an increase from 654.2K users within 24 hours. Overall, the app has seen a 133.8% week-over-week increase since gaining traction at the beginning of January.\n\nThe second layer of irony is that the majority of the app and its posts are in, well, Chinese Mandarin. Instead of letting that hinder their trolling of the U.S. government, however, American users have simply taken to learning key phrases in Mandarin instead.\n\nAnd, according to Duolingo, a lot of these users seem to be taking learning it pretty seriously.\n\nTikTok refugees:Wondering where to go if TikTok is banned? Here are 10 alternatives gaining traction\n\nDuolingo reports 216% growth in new Mandarin learners\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, made Tuesday, Duolingo joked, \"oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin\" to an audience of 15 million viewers, receiving nearly 190k likes for their efforts.\n\nIn another post the next day, Duolingo said, \"Learning Mandarin out of spite? You're not alone. We’ve seen a ~216% growth in new Chinese (Mandarin) learners in the U.S. compared to this time last year.\"\n\nAccording to a press statement Duolingo sent to USA TODAY, this increase is not only a huge year-over-year uptick for Mandarin itself but also represents a \"much bigger increase than other languages.\" For example, said Duolingo, Spanish, one of its most popular languages to learn in the U.S., grew only 40% over the same time period.\n\nHow did a large influx of these U.S. users decide to log on to Duolingo for the first time? TikTok, of course. According to a \"how did you hear about us\" survey conducted by the company, the spike in Mandarin learners has corresponded with a spike in people selecting \"TikTok\" for their answer.\n\nThe majority of these are under the age of 30, according to the company's data, and 43% said they wanted to learn to connect with people, a substantial increase from the baseline of around 25%.\n\n\"Spite has found its most articulate expression yet,\" said one commenter under Duolingo's Wednesday post. \"Turns out you guys are the biggest winner,\" joked another.\n\nWhat is Chinese Mandarin?\n\nMandarin is the most widely spoken dialect of Chinese and is the official language of Mainland China. While all Mandarin is Chinese, not all Chinese is Mandarin, as the umbrella term \"Chinese\" can refer to one of the roughly 129 other dialects spoken by other ethnic groups in China, such as Cantonese.\n\nBecause of its widespread use, however, Mandarin is often colloquially referred to as \"Chinese\" interchangeably.\n\nAmericans show off their new Mandarin skills\n\nSome users have taken to other platforms to show off their new skills, like one video posted to TikTok with over 5 million views in which user @amphetamineanne says joyfully \"Watch this\" before saying in Mandarin: \"What the (expletive) was the U.S. government thinking?\"\n\nUsers @krisdewdew posted a clip with more than 4 million views in which they shared some new key phrases they had learned, including, \"Hello. This is my cat\" and \"I'm learning Mandarin\" along with the caption \"Me after literally 2 hours on RedNote.\"\n\nIn another clip with over a million views posted by @orionsisters, two American sisters have a simple conversation in Mandarin, joking in their caption, \"Us practicing our Chinese so we can move to China and keep TikTok.\"\n\nAgain, multiple comments beneath the posts joked about the pure \"pettiness\" of Americans suddenly learning the language to hit back at the U.S. government's TikTok ban, saying \"It’s crazy how motivational spite is\" and \"Revenge is the best motivation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/03/17/russia-china-ukraine-virginia-ncaa-insulin-tiktok-st-patricks-day/11490839002/", "title": "China, Russia, Ukraine, TikTok, NCAA, insulin, St. Patrick's Day ...", "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow next week in a demonstration of support for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

That's when she saw it, rolling up Beach 208th Street, a half-mile from the ocean — a wave as tall as she was.\n\nShe ran inside, where her family was eating dinner. \"Dad,\" she cried on her way to the second floor, \"water's coming down the road!\" It was 6:30, two nights before Halloween.\n\nSo began the agony of Breezy Point, a village on a spit of beach in a remote corner of the nation's largest city.\n\nHere, the classical elements of water, wind and fire would reduce the heart of the community to a fourth element: earth. The world would marvel at images of flames shooting from a flood — an inferno amid a tempest named Sandy.\n\nA fire chief said it was like \"a wildfire, a forest fire out West.\" A resident a block from the fire line said it was \"like watching Rome burn.\"\n\nAs Sandy approached, the mayor ordered an evacuation. The subsequent withdrawal of the city's fire and rescue service left a community founded and largely populated by firefighters and cops — which lost more residents per capita on 9/11 than any other — suddenly vulnerable to catastrophe.\n\nBut during Thanksgiving weekend, Breezy Point still had something for which to be grateful.\n\nAlthough fire incinerated 111 houses and water ruined scores more, and although many otherwise law-abiding residents defied the evacuation order, no one was killed or seriously hurt.\n\nThe story of how a single house fire turned into one of New York's worst residential blazes in 150 years begins with bad weather and bad timing (full moon, rising tide) and ends with a good idea: use the water that caused the fire to fight it.\n\nThe Irish Riviera\n\nBreezy Point is a dream of seaside living come to life. Its 2,800 homes range from humble '20s bungalows to proud, new, two-story houses bristling with decks. Sticking into the Atlantic at the west end of the Rockaway Peninsula, it's reachable from the city only by bridge and a single road. A guard shack blocks the entrance.\n\nWhat locals call \"The Wedge\" is an older oceanside district whose houses and paths (there are no streets, just a peripheral parking lot) form a triangle. It's the physical expression of Breezy's tight social structure of extended families, many Irish, mostly Catholic. Some come summer after summer; others, including many retirees, are year-round residents.\n\nThe Wedge is also a perfect place for a fire. Frame houses stand cheek by jowl on small lots, with no streets to serve as firebreaks.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Breezy Point still was occupied by at least hundreds and possibly thousands of people, some who thought they could protect their property; some who had no place else to go; and some who believed Sandy was another false alarm, like last year's Hurricane Irene.\n\nJohn Nies, Elizabeth's father, stayed because he was on the volunteer rescue squad and knew that many of his neighbors, particularly older ones, would not evacuate no matter what the mayor said. His wife and three daughters said, \"If you're staying, we're staying.\"\n\nOther holdouts ranged from U.S. Rep. Robert Turner, R-N.Y., and his wife at their beachfront home, to Michael O'Hanlon, 32, on the other side of The Wedge. \"We built this place,\" he told ABC News. \"We're not going anywhere.\"\n\nThe ocean meets the bay\n\nGlenn Serafin, 62, stayed in his gray clapboard house that Monday because he didn't think the storm would be that bad. The wind wasn't that strong, the rain not that heavy. \"It didn't feel like a hurricane,\" he says. He figured he'd stay until the lights went out.\n\nHe spent the afternoon moving stuff off the floor and making sure the sump pumps were working. A 6:15, he went upstairs for a nap.\n\nWithin a half-hour, Breezy Point was underwater.\n\nThe storm surge came from the Atlantic to the south and Jamaica Bay to the north, \"swishing back and forth like water in a bathtub,\" Nies says.\n\nThe water lifted houses off foundations and pushed them into each other. It ripped doors off hinges, toppled 300-pound breakfronts, pushed freezers filled with beef across the room. It opened sinkholes and dislodged cesspools.\n\nThe water carried away Kathleen Henderson's deck and forced octogenarians Bill and Mary Norton up onto their bed, where they waited for hours to be rescued. On the bay side, it smashed in the windows of Jack Nacmias' basement, driving him upstairs and filling the 8-feet-high room in seconds, like a compartment on the Titanic.\n\nThe power failed, plunging homes into darkness and their occupants into panic.\n\nWater rushed into the Rockaway Point Volunteer Fire Department, disabling both firetrucks and both ambulances.\n\nA rescue team in motor boats responding to a distress call had to turn back; the debris was too thick, the current too strong. The team slipped into the Breezy Point Clubhouse, a community center, where refugees huddled on a stage as the water rose up the wall, saying\n\nThe Lord's Prayer.\n\nSerafin was awakened from his nap by the sound of rushing water, followed by the hissing sound of salt water flowing into electrical outlets. When he looked outside, his house was surrounded. To leave via the front door would mean wading chin-high through a fast-moving stream.\n\nThen he looked out back. Smoke and flames seemed to be coming from a bungalow two houses away. Soon, it spread to Turner's house. \"I said to myself, 'I've got a problem here,'\" Serafin recalls. \"I have water in front of me and fire behind me.\"\n\nHe waded outside, found that a neighbor's water spigot still had some pressure and started using a lemonade pitcher to throw water against the side of his house. When heat from the fires became too much, he retreated inside, dousing his plastic porch storm windows to stop them from imploding.\n\nBy now the fire was moving up Ocean Avenue, the walk next to Serafin's. \"I kept saying, 'Please don't let the next house catch on fire,'\" Serafin said.\n\nBut walls designed to contain fire for two hours were holding for 15 minutes. One by one, the houses on Ocean ignited: No. 165, the Strongs, who'd spent $400,000 on renovations; No. 160, the Dwyers, who'd lived there 23 years; No. 168, summer home to four generations of Tullys.\n\nThe blaze fanned out diagonally to the north and west, rousting people who'd climbed to second floors and decks to escape the flood. Some now jumped porch to porch to stay above the water and ahead of the fire.\n\nThe fire ignited telephone poles, melted siding, bent porch rails. Smoke obscured almost everything, including the sight of the Empire State Building.\n\nThe fire was not just out of control. It was unopposed.\n\nThe New York Fire Department had moved its trucks out of the evacuation zone to protect them against storm surge. When Nies called the city hotline to report smoke, the operator told him \"no resources before midnight\" — the water was too high for trucks to get through.\n\nBreezy Point was on its own.\n\nThe crowd of refugees in the clubhouse rose to around 90. Although the water had receded, now the room was filling with smoke. Cinders were drifting onto the roof. The fire was coming.\n\nSome volunteer firemen decided to wade to the firehouse next door and try to start a firetruck that had been standing in water. When the ignition caught, recalls one of them, Deputy Chief Jimmy Morton, it was a wonderful sound: \"It was a game changer. We had a way out.\"\n\nJammed with people, the truck plowed through flooded streets to the relative safety of a church.\n\nSometime after midnight, Glenn Serafin put down his lemonade pitcher and went out on his second-floor deck.\n\nAll the houses on Ocean had collapsed, affording him a full view of the fire field. It made him think of Nero's Rome. Standing alone in rain and howling wind, he beheld a world of fire, limitless and insatiable.\n\nFire on the water\n\nAssistant Fire Chief Joseph Pfeifer was the first chief at the World Trade Center on 9/11, and he now sorely wanted to be the first at Breezy Point, where his family had summered, where he'd fought his first fire as a teenage volunteer and where he now owned a home.\n\nBut before midnight, he stood helplessly and impatiently near the entrance to the bridge from Brooklyn, watching the red glow in the distance.\n\nWater on the road into Breezy was still too high for his SUV, so he called for an engine to pick him up. It turned out to be No. 10 from Lower Manhattan, the first to respond on 9/11. As the truck plowed through the water, its engine began to smoke. \"Don't stop!\" Pfeifer ordered.\n\nHe arrived at a fire unlike any he'd ever seen. Dozens of houses were gone. Others were exploding into flames from radiant heat. Wind gusts up to 70 mph drove the blaze forward, showering firefighters with embers the size of baseballs and spraying their water back in their faces. Natural gas lines were melting, rupturing and exploding, sending flames 10 stories in the air.\n\nLocal volunteers had managed to get a single hose on the fire; it had been burning, essentially unchecked, for about five hours.\n\nThe storm surge had damaged water pipes, leaving hydrants with little or no pressure, and had created a waist-high moat around the fire. Worse, The Wedge's narrow, debris-clogged lanes were impassable.\n\nPfeifer's only hope was to contain the fire — get ahead of it, outflank it.\n\nFirefighters made the best of a bad situation by pumping up the corrosive, muck-filled saltwater at their feet and shooting it back at the fire. The technique, \"drafting,\" is so unusual that most of them had never done it before.\n\nThe city firefighters were joined by Breezy Point's volunteers, including one whose house already was lost.\n\n\"He stood there on the corner where his house was, and he did his job,\" says Morton, the deputy chief. \"He just pulled hose and kept his composure the best he could.\"\n\nThere was a parking lot on the fire's northern flank that offered a firebreak. Here, Pfeifer stationed 70-foot-high \"tower ladders,\" atop which air-masked firefighters lashed to their posts manned high-pressure hoses.\n\nBut the ladder trucks couldn't maneuver in the tight grid of walks on the western side of The Wedge, where the fire was heading.\n\nThen, luckily, the wind shifted to the north, allowing firefighters time to carry hoses to the western flank.\n\nAround dawn, after almost 12 hours, six alarms and the efforts of 300 firefighters from firehouses across the city, Pfeifer — who'd sustained a second-degree burn on his face from an ember — declared the fire under control.\n\nThe cause of the fire would remain under investigation for weeks, but volunteer fire officers said it may have been started by a transformer that exploded near the bungalow on Ocean when the storm surge hit.\n\nThe Nies family squeezed into one bedroom in a relative's Brooklyn basement. They face weeks of what John calls \"quality bonding,\" while they await the resumption of basic services to their house, which suffered relatively minor water damage.\n\nSerafin spent the night of the fire in his own bed. The first fireman to reach his door the next day regarded him curiously: \"You weren't here, were you?\" He admits he was wrong about the storm: \"The water was bad. The fire was bad. It was all bad.\"\n\nToday, he says, he feels at peace, thankful for his escape from water and fire, thankful it all wasn't worse. In his hallway hangs a sign with a message that speaks of Breezy Point's determination to come back: \"Life is Good at the Beach.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/12/would-tiktoks-downfall-make-snapchat-a-buy/112121380/", "title": "Would TikTok's Downfall Make Snapchat a Buy? | The Motley Fool", "text": "Leo Sun\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nByteDance's TikTok (known as Douyin in China) caught fire after its launch in late 2016. The short video app attracted 500 million monthly active users (MAUs) by mid-2018, then surpassed 800 million MAUs earlier this year.\n\nTikTok's meteoric rise seemingly threatened Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, which targets the same Gen Z market with its ephemeral messages and short videos. TikTok clearly covets Snap's core market: It bought so many ads on Snapchat it became its top advertiser last year, according to MediaRadar, and it poached over a dozen employees from Snap.\n\nThat's why a double whammy of bad news for TikTok recently boosted Snap's stock. First, Indian regulators banned TikTok, along with dozens of other Chinese apps, citing privacy concerns and escalating tensions with China. Second, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the U.S. was also \"looking at\" a ban on all Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, during a recent Fox News interview. Could TikTok's recent regulatory pain generate long-term gains for Snap's investors?\n\nAre Snapchat and TikTok rivals or peers?\n\nSnapchat's core business is built on disappearing apps, photos and videos, and its extended ecosystem includes short Discover videos, AR lenses and video games. Snapchat's main network is focused on private connections with peers, but users can upload public videos to its searchable Snap Map.\n\nMore:Amazon requiring employees to remove TikTok app from their devices\n\nTikTok's platform is built for quickly sharing short videos, usually paired with music clips, to a broad audience of both followers and strangers. TikTok's default settings allow users to share all their videos publicly, and they need to tweak the settings to upload private videos instead.\n\nIn short, Snap and TikTok are both popular with teen users, but they're very different apps. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel actually referred to TikTok as a \"friend\" and a top advertising partner during a conference call last October, and there's no real evidence that TikTok is stealing away Snapchat's users.\n\nBetween the first quarters of 2016 and 2020, Snapchat's daily active users (DAUs) grew from 122 million to 229 million, while its average revenue per user (ARPU) surged from $0.32 to $2.02. Those robust growth rates coincide with TikTok's expansion, and they suggest there's plenty of room for both apps to grow without trampling each other.\n\nBut clipping TikTok's wings could still help Snap\n\nNonetheless, Snap and TikTok still have overlapping interests. Snapchat's Snap Map and Discover videos target TikTok's audience of short video viewers, while TikTok's direct messages compete with Snapchat's messages.\n\nSnap also considers India to be a major growth market (it opened its first office last year); a country that recently banned Tiktok. Snap now offers the app in multiple Indian languages, and is developing more localized and \"culturally relevant\" content for its Indian users.\n\nPenny stocks or fractional shares?:Where to invest just a few dollars at a time\n\nSnap doesn't disclose its exact growth rates in India, but chief business officer Jeremi Gorman declared it was \"growing rapidly\" in the region during last quarter's conference call. That growth could boost Snap's total DAUs in its Rest of World region, which rose 45% annually to 71 million last quarter.\n\nTikTok's troubles in the U.S. could also strengthen Snap's North American business, which grew its DAUs 10% to 88 million last quarter – but still expanded at a slower rate than its European and Rest of World regions.\n\nSnap's investors should maintain realistic expectations\n\nSnap could clearly benefit from TikTok's troubles, but investors should recall that Snapchat also faces fierce competition from Facebook's Instagram, which cloned many of its popular features. It was arguably competition from Instagram, not TikTok, that caused Snap's sequential DAU growth to stall out throughout 2018. Banning TikTok could merely send more short video creators – and their followers – to Instagram.\n\nTherefore, Snap investors should maintain realistic expectations amid a flurry of bullish predictions regarding TikTok's problems, and realize a lot of that potential growth could already be baked into the stock – which has nearly doubled over the past three months and trades at a frothy 13 times next year's sales.\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It allowed council house tenants to buy the homes they lived in and forced local authorities to sell their properties on request at a discount.\n\nUnder the policy as it stands today, council tenants can get up to 70% off the market price, depending on how long they have lived there – but the scheme is much more restrictive when it comes to housing associations.\n\nRight to Buy has proved to be a controversial policy in the intervening years, leading some to wonder if it should be revived.\n\n1. Pro: more on the housing ladder\n\nBetween 1980 and 2021, 1.8 million households in England purchased a home from their local authority using the Right to Buy scheme. The Telegraph said it “achieved its goal of getting more people on the housing ladder in its former years” but its “popularity has waned since”.\n\nThe BBC estimated that 2.4 million people rent from housing associations, so would now be eligible for the scheme. It added that Johnson will also “suggest allowing housing benefit to count towards a mortgage”.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that it ignores the needs of private tenants.\n\n2. Con: fewer affordable homes\n\nHousing experts have warned the policy could significantly reduce the number of affordable homes available to renters amid a cost-of-living crisis, and have instead called for an increase in house building.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, told The Guardian: “There could not be a worse time to sell off what remains of our last truly affordable social homes.” She added that “more people are on the brink of homelessness than homeownership”.\n\nOther experts have warned that the Thatcherite policy “left a trail of destruction in its wake” after the government failed to ensure houses that were being sold to tenants were replaced, leaving little housing stock left for those who relied on social housing, said The Telegraph. Since the launch of Right to Buy, “just 358,350 new local authority properties were built – a replacement rate of less than 20%”. The government is expected to mitigate this when it launches the scheme.\n\n3. Pro: historically popular policy\n\nFor Thatcher, the policy was a “resounding success”, transforming her political fortunes and becoming one of the most popular policies of the era, according to the Daily Mail. It said that in the first year alone, the government received up to 1,000 applications to buy each day. In the first two years of the scheme, more than 107,000 properties were sold to council tenants.\n\nMichael Heseltine, who as environment secretary was in charge of turning the policy into law, said at the time that “no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people”.\n\nEven now, the idea of home ownership is a popular one, with 62% of Britons without property saying they would like to own their own home in the future, according to a YouGov poll last year.\n\nWhen Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities, which put severe pressure on their housing stock, including almost the whole of London. But, as the Daily Mail noted: “Tony Blair’s government never actually attempted to abolish Right to Buy – perhaps wary of the huge backlash that could result.”\n\n4. Con: lack of good rental stock\n\nCritics have said that many of the “decent” housing association properties have already been sold off, leaving current housing association tenants with few tempting options if they were seeking to buy, said The Guardian.\n\nToby Lloyd, a housing consultant and former special adviser, told The Telegraph that the new policy could also prove “extraordinarily expensive” for the government.\n\n“The Conservative party has been promising to extend Right to Buy to housing associations for years, but the reason it has not been successful is because it is much harder,” he said.\n\n“The whole point of housing associations is they are independent charities and not part of the state, and so the Government cannot just help itself to their assets. It will be extraordinarily expensive to persuade them to sell houses off.”\n\n5. Pro: prevents social exclusion\n\nOne argument for proponents of Right to Buy is that it helps create communities of different social classes, and in neighbourhoods where Right to Buy has been taken up it is argued that “the presence of economically active households reduces the social exclusion of an area”.\n\nIt is also argued that people with a financial stake in their neighbourhood and property have “more incentive to look after it and the neighbourhood around it”, said The Guardian.\n\n6. Con: obstacles for tenants\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, Neal Hudson, of BuiltPlace analysts, said that the demographic of social renters coupled with a huge rise in house prices means that a revival of Right to Buy would not be as successful as when it was introduced in the 1980s.\n\nThe paper said that “Hudson warned many tenants living in housing association properties were unlikely to be able to afford current house prices” even if they were given big discounts, as under the current Right to Buy scheme.\n\nHe added that property ownership was not always “suitable” for those using social rented housing, which he said was a “vital safety net for those on lower incomes and the vulnerable who can’t work”. He said that social housing tenants could fall into financial difficulty if they chose to buy their property, as “property ownership does come with additional, and sometimes unexpected, costs such as mortgage repayments and repairs”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/958220/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-19-october-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 19 October 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Truss faces further unrest\n\nLiz Truss is facing even greater unrest from ministers over her plans for “brutal public spending cuts” after the “disastrous” mini-budget put major pledges at risk, including the pensions triple lock, said The Guardian. Truss has told MPs on the right of her party that her tax U-turns were “painful”. The prime minister is attempting to shore up support in her party, but, a former minister told the inews site: “She’s more f**ked than Boris. When your personal ratings are -70 and the party is -33, there’s no way out of that.”\n\nCan Jeremy Hunt’s mini-budget reversal save Truss?\n\n2. ‘Melting ice’ could cause pandemic\n\nThe next pandemic may come not “from bats or birds” but from “matter in melting ice”, said The Guardian. Research of soil and lake sediments from the largest high Arctic freshwater lake in the world, Lake Hazen, suggests the risk of viral spillover is greater close to melting glaciers. In 2016 an outbreak of anthrax in northern Siberia, that killed a child and infected at least seven other people, was blamed on a heatwave that melted permafrost and exposed an infected reindeer carcass.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Inflation back to double figures\n\nNew data is expected to show inflation returned to double figures in September due to the spiralling cost of food. As the Office for National Statistics prepares to reveal the latest increase in the cost of living for UK households, a survey for the BBC found that some 85% of those asked are now worried about the crisis, up from 69% in a similar poll in January. A separate new survey has showed “confidence among British businesses has dropped”, said Sky News.\n\nWhy does inflation matter?\n\n4. Hunt will ‘target banks’\n\nThe chancellor will raid the profits of banks and energy companies in an attempt to fill a £40bn fiscal hole through a mix of tax rises and public spending cuts. Allies of Jeremy Hunt’s say his budget on October 31 will see him target the earnings of lenders and oil and gas companies. Lenders are expected to make “bumper profits from rising interest rates”, said the Financial Times, including from reserves held on deposits overnight at the Bank of England, and from bigger margins on lending.\n\nThe arguments for and against a windfall tax on oil and gas profits\n\n5. China diplomat ‘involved in violence’\n\nA UK MP has claimed that one of Beijing’s most senior UK diplomats was involved in violence against protesters at the Manchester consulate at the weekend. “What we saw was the Chinese consul-general then ripping down posters and peaceful protest,” Alicia Kearns told fellow MPs in the House of Commons. China claims the protestors had “illegally entered” the grounds of the consulate.\n\n6. Fears grow that Putin will go nuclear\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace has flown to Washington for emergency talks with the Pentagon amid mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin will make a “nuclear show of force”, said the Daily Mail. After the new head of Russia’s armed forces Sergei Suvorikin, nicknamed General Armageddon, launched a series of missile and drone strikes, a security source told The Sun that fears are growing that the Russian president is considering detonating a low-yield nuclear warhead over the Black Sea. “The threat has increased recently”, they said.\n\nDoes Syria offer warnings for Russia’s Ukraine escalation?\n\n7. Parental coldness linked to childhood obesity\n\nChildren whose parents lack emotional warmth are more likely to grow up overweight or obese, according to a ground-breaking new study. Researchers at the International Congress on Obesity in Melbourne will announce today that parental warmth is key to a healthy weight. After studying data on 10,000 children in the UK, they found authoritarian and neglectful parenting in early childhood – both characterised by a lack of warmth - were linked with higher weight throughout childhood and adolescence. In England, more than a quarter of four- and five-year-olds are overweight or obese.\n\nWhy might UK scrap anti-obesity drive?\n\n8. Rees-Mogg could be sued over fracking\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg is “facing legal action over his decision to lift the freeze on fracking”, according to The Independent. Climate and community groups have sent a legal letter to the business secretary, seen by the paper, announcing their plan to seek judicial review of his decision. The activists believe they are grounds to suggest that it was “unlawful” to reverse the 2019 ban on the controversial gas extraction method without fresh scientific evidence to prove it is safe. Meanwhile, Labour is pushing for fracking to be banned “once and for all” through a parliamentary vote.\n\nThe pros and cons of fracking\n\n9. Fuel costs put Brits back on bikes\n\nRising fuel prices are putting Brits “back in the saddle”, said The Times. Citing figures from the Department for Transport, the paper said in the past four months cycling levels are 54% higher than before the pandemic and 11% up on the same period in 2020, when people were told to avoid public transport due to Covid. “The surge in people cycling since March, particularly midweek, corresponds with rising costs of fuel and living in general,” said Sarah Mitchell, the chief executive of Cycling UK.\n\nHow high will petrol prices go?\n\n10. Rapper wins Mercury Prize\n\nLittle Simz has won the Mercury Prize, for the best British or Irish album of the last 12 months. The rapper took the £25,000 award for her fourth album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, described by the BBC as a “hip-hop coming-of-age tale delivered with a cinematic sweep”. Accepting the award at London’s Eventim Apollo, Simz, born Simbiatu Ajikawo, said: “Glory to God – God thank you so much; to my family over here, my loved ones right here.”\n\nThe best albums of 2021", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/tech/tiktok-video-recommendations/index.html", "title": "TikTok is removing some of the mystery behind how it recommends ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why TikTok suggested a certain video in your feed, you may start to get a little more clarity.\n\nTikTok on Tuesday said it is beginning to roll out a new feature to add more context about how the platform’s algorithms recommend videos in your “For You” feed. With the new option, you can click on the share button on the video and then select the question mark icon dubbed, “Why this video.”\n\nFrom there, TikTok said you can get more visibility into some of the reasons why a particular video was recommended to you. Some of these reasons include: “user interactions,” which refers to content you watch, like or share as well as comments you post and things you have searched for on the app; “accounts you follow or suggested accounts for you;” “content posted recently in your region;” or “popular content in your region.”\n\nLike other social networks, TikTok relies on algorithms to surface personalized content for users in hopes of keeping them engaged and scrolling as long as possible. But these algorithms are typically black boxes.\n\nThe new feature stops short of truly demystifying that black box by providing more granular details on specific activity or accounts influencing the algorithmic recommendations. But TikTok said that it has plans to build up this feature with more details in the future. “Looking ahead, we’ll continue to expand this feature to bring more granularity and transparency to content recommendations,” the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe new update comes in the wake of renewed scrutiny that TikTok’s powerful algorithm may lead users, and especially its youngest users, down concerning rabbit holes, including directing them to potentially harmful subject matter such as content around suicide and eating disorders.\n\nIt also comes as a growing number of state and federal lawmakers continue to pressure TikTok over its ties to Beijing through its parent company. The criticism ramped up earlier this year after a Buzzfeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China.\n\nLast week, a trio of lawmakers led by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio introduced a bill that aims to ban TikTok from operating in the United States. In a statement announcing the proposed legislation, Rubio accused TikTok of collecting data to “manipulate feeds” and blasted the app as a “CCP [Chinese Communist Party]-puppet company.”\n\nTikTok has been negotiating for years with the US government on a potential deal that addresses national security concerns and lets the app continue serving US customers. TikTok has also taken steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business.\n\nTikTok has made a number of announcements in recent years in an effort to ease concerns, including publishing tools to help users customize content recommendations, rolling out parental controls to give users more options to restrict what their children can see on the app, and pledging more transparency related to its content moderation systems for researchers.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/tech/yoel-roth-twitter-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Twitter is less safe due to Elon Musk's management style, says ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk’s dictatorial management style risks driving the company headlong into unforced business blunders, content moderation disasters and the degradation of core platform features that help keep vulnerable users safe, according to a former top Twitter official who led the company’s content moderation before abruptly resigning this month.\n\nThe social media company’s botched rollout of a paid verification feature “is an example of a disaster that slipped through” amid the chaos Musk brought to Twitter, and the prospect of further disasters made it impossible to stay, said Yoel Roth, the company’s former head of site integrity, during an onstage interview with the journalist Kara Swisher Tuesday in his first public appearance since quitting Twitter on Nov. 10.\n\nRoth and other colleagues tried to warn Musk of the “obvious” problems in his plan to offer a verified check mark to any user who paid $8 a month. But Musk charged ahead anyway through sheer force of will, leading to a wave of new impostor accounts posing as major brands, athletes and other verified users that soon forced Twitter to suspend the feature.\n\n“It went off the rails in exactly the ways that we anticipated,” Roth said, speaking at a conference hosted by the Knight Foundation, a journalism nonprofit.\n\nThe public reflections of a senior Twitter leader who had close contact with Musk in the raw, early days of his ownership of the company — a period marked by internal tumult and a damaging advertiser revolt — provide the latest evidence of a billionaire CEO who leads by his gut at the expense of virtually everyone else.\n\nThere was no explosive confrontation with Musk that led to Roth’s resignation, and the episode involving Twitter’s paid verification feature was only one of many factors that drove Roth’s decision to leave, he said. But the experience exemplified the kind of damage Musk’s freewheeling approach can do, Roth added, likening his final weeks at the company to standing before a leaky dam, trying desperately to plug the holes but knowing that eventually something would get past him.\n\nIn the hour-long interview, Roth warned Musk’s laissez-faire approach to content moderation, and his lack of a transparent process for making and enforcing platform policies, has made Twitter less safe, in part because there aren’t enough staff remaining who understand that malicious actors are constantly trying to game the system in ways that automated algorithms don’t know how to catch.\n\n“People are not sitting still,” he said. “They are actively devising new ways to be horrible on the internet.”\n\nHe urged Twitter users to monitor the functioning of key safety features such as muting, blocking and protected tweets as early warning signs the platform may be breaking down.\n\n“If protected tweets stop working, run,” he said.\n\nFor two weeks after Musk closed his purchase of Twitter, Roth presented himself as a voice of stability and calm at the center of a company undergoing dramatic change. Roth knew that by remaining at the company, Musk was using him to help keep advertisers from abandoning the platform. But Roth also suggested that he and others who did not leave Twitter may have been able to influence Musk and keep him from making damaging unilateral decisions, which he had “multiple opportunities” to do.\n\nEven as he spent his initial days in the new regime battling a “surge in hateful conduct on Twitter” apparently meant to test Musk’s tolerance for racism and antisemitism on the platform, Roth sought to reassure the public that Twitter’s trust and safety work continued unhindered.\n\nHe shared data on the platform’s ongoing enforcement efforts, and downplayed the impact of Twitter’s mass layoffs on its content moderation team, saying the job cuts were less severe in that department compared to the wider organization.\n\nAs late as Nov. 9, Roth spoke alongside Musk during a public Twitter Spaces event intended to persuade advertisers not to flee the platform. In the hour-long session, which was attended by more than 100,000 listeners, including representatives of Adidas, Chevron and other major brands, Roth waxed optimistic about Twitter’s plans to fight hate speech.\n\nThe very next day, Roth abruptly resigned, joining a slew of other senior executives including Twitter’s chief privacy officer and chief information security officer.\n\nIn a subsequent New York Times op-ed, Roth said his reason for leaving came down to Musk’s highly personal and improvisational approach to content moderation. Roth’s essay accused Musk of perpetuating a “lack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-length pronouncements about Twitter’s rules.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Roth said the popular narrative that describes Musk as a villain is wrong and doesn’t reflect his own experiences with him. But, he said, Musk surrounds himself with those who rarely challenge him.\n\nBefore Musk took over Twitter, Roth wrote down several commitments to himself that would trigger the decision to quit. One limit, he said — one that was never reached — was that Roth would refuse to lie for Musk. Another limit, one that was ultimately reached and drove his decision to resign, was “if Twitter starts being ruled by dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.”\n\nRoth’s role at Twitter came under intense scrutiny in 2020 after the company appended a fact-check message to false tweets by then-US President Donald Trump.\n\nTweets that Roth sent in 2016 and 2017 that were critical of President Trump and his supporters were dug up and used to argue that Roth and Twitter were biased against the president.\n\nAmong Roth’s tweets was one he wrote on Election Day 2016 that read, “I’m just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.”\n\nTwitter defended Roth at the time, saying, “No one person at Twitter is responsible for our policies or enforcement actions, and it’s unfortunate to see individual employees targeted for company decisions.”\n\nWhen Roth was still working at Twitter in October, Musk was asked about Roth’s old tweets.\n\n“We’ve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs,” Musk tweeted.\n\nRoth also became the personal face of Twitter, and a target of harassment, after the company decided to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden, a decision then-CEO Jack Dorsey has since said was a mistake.\n\n“It’s widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden story. That is not true. It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue,” Roth told Swisher on Tuesday.\n\nRoth did not feel removing the content from Twitter was appropriate, he said, but at the time the story seemed to bear the hallmarks of a hack-and-leak information operation. Roth also said Tuesday that, in retrospect, suppressing the Hunter Biden story was a mistake.\n\n“They were on alert from what happened in 2016 and all the hacked emails and things,” Swisher told CNN Wednesday morning, reflecting on her discussion with Roth.\n\nWhile Roth may have disagreed with suppressing the Hunter Biden story, he defended Twitter’s other decisions to ban Trump for his activities around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, as well as a personal account belonging to Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and an account belonging to the satirical website Babylon Bee.\n\nAll three cases involved obvious violations of Twitter’s publicly accessible, written policies, Roth said, making them a much clearer case for enforcement.\n\nAmid the layoffs that have decimated Twitter’s content moderation team, Musk has said he intends to rely much more heavily on crowdsourced fact-checking of tweets to provide context to misleading claims. But Roth said that in doing so, Twitter risks abdicating its responsibility to the public, which should still apply despite it being a private company.\n\nPolicymakers should require platforms to share data with academics and researchers, he said, preempting privately owned platforms such as Twitter from shirking a duty to transparency.\n\nAsked to give a single piece of advice to Musk going forward, Roth paused for the briefest of moments.\n\n“Humility goes a really long way,” he said.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n- CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/alabama/2023/08/15/riverfront-brawl-videos-spark-cultural-moment-about-race-solidarity/70592213007/", "title": "Alabama riverfront brawl videos spark a cultural moment about race ...", "text": "Aaron Morrison, Aisha I. Jefferson and Kim Chandler\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAs bystanders trained their smartphone cameras on the riverfront dock while several white boaters pummeled a Black riverboat co-captain, they couldn’t have known the footage would elicit a national conversation about racial solidarity.\n\nYet, a week after multiple videos showing the now-infamous brawl and valiant defense of the outnumbered co-captain were shared widely on social media, it’s clear the event truly tapped into the psyche of Black America and created a broader cultural moment.\n\nAndrea Boyles, a sociology professor at Tulane University, said a long history of anti-Black racism and attacks and current events likely magnified the attack’s impact and response.\n\n“Especially at a time like now where we see an increase in anti-Black racism through legislation and otherwise, whether we’re thinking about history, the banning of Black history and curriculum and all sorts of things across the state of Florida” and elsewhere, Boyles said. “So this is why it is on the forefront of people’s minds. And folks are very much tuned in, Black people in particular.”\n\nMany see the Aug. 5 ordeal on the riverfront dock in Montgomery, Alabama’s capital city steeped in civil rights history, as a long-awaited answer to countless calls for help that went unanswered for past Black victims of violence and mob attacks.\n\n“We witnessed a white mob doing this to him,” said Michelle Browder, an artist and social justice entrepreneur in Montgomery, describing the attack by boaters on the Black riverboat co-captain.\n\n“I call it a mob because that is what it was, it was a mob mentality,” she added. “It then became a moment because you saw Black people coming together.”\n\nAfter being inundated with images and stories of lethal violence against Black people, including motorists in traffic stops, church parishioners and grocery shoppers, the video from Montgomery struck a chord because it didn’t end in the worst of outcomes for Black Americans.\n\n“For Montgomery to have this moment, we needed to see a win. We needed to see our community coming together and we needed to see justice,” Browder said.\n\nVideos of the brawl showed the participants largely divided along racial lines. Several white men punched or shoved the Black riverboat co-captain after he took a separate vessel to shore and tried to move their pontoon boat. The white boaters’ private vessel was docked in a spot designated for the city-owned Harriott II riverboat, on which more than 200 passengers were waiting to disembark.\n\nThe videos then showed mostly Black people rushing to the co-captain’s defense, including a Black teenage riverboat crew member who swam to the dock. The videos also showed the ensuing brawl that included a Black man hitting a white person with a folding chair.\n\nAs of Friday, Alabama police had charged four white people with misdemeanor assault. The folding chair-wielding man turned himself in Friday and was charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nJim Kittrell, the captain of Harriott II, told The Daily Beast that he thought race might have been a factor in the initial attack on his co-captain, but the resulting melee was not a “Black and white thing.”\n\n“This was our crew upset about these idiots,” Kittrell also told WACV radio station.\n\nHe later explained that several members of his crew, seen confronting the pontoon boat party after the riverboat docked, “felt they had to retaliate, which was unfortunate.”\n\n“I wish we could have stopped it from happening but, when you see something like that, it was difficult. It was difficult for me to sit there in the wheelhouse watching him being attacked,” Kittrell told the station.\n\nKittrell told The Associated Press by phone that the city had asked him not to talk about the brawl.\n\nMajor Saba Coleman of the Montgomery Police Department said on Tuesday that hate crime charges were ruled out after the department consulted with the local FBI. But several observers noted the presence of a hate motivation, or lack thereof, on the part of the pontoon boat party was not why the event resonated so strongly.\n\n“All these individuals having smartphones and cameras have democratized media and information. In the past, it was a very narrow scope on what news was being reported and from what perspectives,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said.\n\nThe technology, Johnson added, “opened up an opportunity for America as a whole to understand the impact of racism, the impact of violence and the opportunity to create a narrative that’s more consistent with keeping African Americans and other communities safe.”\n\nMore:'Black Aquaman' and the 'Boston Tea Party': World watches Montgomery riverfront brawl\n\nThe riverfront brawl spawned a multitude of memes, jokes, parodies, reenactments and even T-shirts. “Lift every chair and swing,” read one shirt in a play on “ Lift Ev’ry Voice And Sing,” the late-19th century hymn sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem.\n\nAnother meme likened the co-captain’s toss of his hat into the air to sending the “bat signal,” a reference to the D.C. Comics character Batman. One image of the scene captured from bystander video was altered to imitate Marvel Comics’ Avengers characters assembling through magic portals on the dock to defend the Black co-captain.\n\nMany observers on social media were quick to point out the significance of the city and location where the brawl took place. Montgomery was the first capital of the Confederacy and the riverfront is an area where enslaved people were once unloaded to be sold at auction. The area is a few blocks from the spot where Rosa Parks was arrested for disobeying bus segregation laws.\n\n“Much of (the riverfront brawl reaction) is emblematic of the history of Montgomery,” said Timothy Welbeck, the director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\n“This is the home of the bus boycott; this is the home of intense, racialized segregation and various forms of resistance today,” he said. “Even if there wasn’t an explicit mention of race, many people saw a white man assaulting a Black man as a proxy for some of the racist behavior that they’ve seen before. It brought about a sense of solidarity and unified fate, too, in this particular moment.”\n\nThen there’s the lingering trauma of seeing past Black victims of violence and mob attacks suffer without help or intervention. Here was the rare event in which bystanders not only chronicled the moment but were able to intervene and help someone they saw being victimized.\n\nIn other notable instances, such as George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, bystanders were restrained because the perpetrators were law enforcement officers. In a video of Floyd’s encounter with police filmed by Black bystander Darnella Frazier, people can be heard pleading for the Black man’s life as he gasped for air with a white officer’s knee held to his neck.\n\nPhysically intervening in Minneapolis would have invited arrests and placed the would-be rescuers at risk for harm themselves.\n\nHistorically, lynching victims were often taken from their families as the Black community had to stand by mutely. Emmett Till’s family members in Mississippi were haunted by their inability to stop the white men who kidnapped and killed him.\n\nBowder, the Montgomery artist, said the conversation needs to continue.\n\n“I’m hoping for a hopeful message out of this,” she said.\n\nKatrina Hazzard, a Rutgers University professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice, said she has seen that hopeful message in the comments of support that have crossed racial and ethnic lines in identifying the aggressors and the right for people to defend themselves and the crewman.\n\n“That’s just been refreshing for me to see and for me to hear across the board,” she said.\n\nAisha I.

The product is currently sold out on many online shops.\n\nIts sudden surge in popularity prompted Dalian Leasun Food, one of the country’s largest canned food manufacturers, to clarify in a Weibo post that canned yellow peaches don’t have any medicinal effect.\n\n“Canned yellow peaches ≠ medicines!” the company said in the post published Friday. “There is enough supply, so there is no need to panic. There is no rush to buy.”\n\nThe People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, also tried to set the record straight.

On Monday, the Beijing city government warned residents that it was facing “great pressure” to meet demand for drug and medical services because of panic buying and an influx of patients at clinics.\n\nIt urged the public not to hoard drugs or call emergency services if they have no symptoms.\n\nStock frenzy\n\nThe rising demand and shortage of supply of Covid remedies have fueled bets on drugmakers.\n\nShares of Hong Kong-listed Xinhua Pharmaceutical, China’s largest manufacturer of ibuprofen, have gained 60% in the past five days.

It is also known as Advil, Brufen, or Fenbid.\n\nThe drug shortage has spread from mainland China to Hong Kong, a special administrative region which has a separate system of local government. On Sunday, the city’s health chief urged the public to refrain from panic buying cold medicines they do not need and urged residents “not to overact.”\n\nIn some Hong Kong drugstores, fever drugs such as Panadol, the local brand name for Tylenol, have sold out. Most of the buyers were sending the medicines to their families and friends in the mainland, sales representatives told CNN.\n\nShares of Shenzhen-listed Guizhou Bailing Group Pharmaceuticals, known for making cough syrup, have gained 21% this week and risen 51% so far this month. Yiling Pharmaceutical, the sole producer of Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional Chinese medicine recommended by the government for treating Covid, has also jumped more than 30% in the past month.\n\nEven providers of funeral services and burial plots have gotten a huge boost.

Trump, who defeated Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, in November, will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20.\n\nBiden’s 13-minute address marked not only as his departing words after four years in the nation’s highest office, but also served as a coda to a career of public service that spanned more than half a century.Here are five key takeaways from his speech:\n\nBiden celebrates Gaza ceasefire deal\n\nMuch of Biden’s time in the Oval Office has been consumed by events on the international stage, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip.\n\nJust hours before he addressed the nation, Biden announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal after more than 15 months of war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The Biden administration brokered the deal, along with Qatar and Egypt.\n\nBiden started his speech by reflecting for a few minutes on that agreement, which he said had resulted from eight months of nonstop negotiations.\n\nWhile the plan was developed and negotiated by his team, Biden noted that it will be largely implemented by the incoming Trump administration. Biden said he had instructed his team to keep Trump and his staff fully informed about the agreement “because that’s how it should be – working together as Americans.”\n\nBiden also noted that, under his watch, “Ukraine is still free” nearly three years after it was invaded by Russia. NATO has been strengthened, he said, “and we pulled ahead of our competition with China.”\n\nExclusive:In sit-down with USA TODAY, Biden reveals his biggest regret and the compliment Trump gave him\n\nBiden touts job creation, other successes\n\nBiden used his address to tout what he sees as his accomplishments on the domestic front.\n\nWhen he came into office four years ago, the nation was still reeling from the deadly COVID pandemic that had wreaked havoc on the economy. The pandemic wiped out 22 million jobs because businesses were forced to shut down temporarily.\n\nBut through resilience, he said, the country bounced back, creating 17 million new jobs in the process, with entrepreneurs and companies setting up new businesses and industries hiring American workers using American products.\n\nMissile strikes and deadly storms:How cascading crises engulfed Biden's final months as president\n\n“We’ve launched a new era of American possibilities,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to his administration’s campaign to modernize the nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels, bring high-speed internet to rural Americans and invest billions of dollars to bring semiconductor supply chains back to the United States “where they belong.” He also cited efforts giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for millions of seniors and the passage of the most significant gun-safety law in three decades.\n\n“It will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together,” Biden said, “but the seeds are planted. And they'll grow and they'll bloom for decades to come.”\n\nBiden warns 'oligarchy' threatens democracy\n\nWhile he celebrated the past, Biden also warned of dangers in the future – particularly the potential rise of a “tech industrial complex” and an “oligarchy” of “extreme, wealth and power” that he said threatens American democracy.\n\nAmericans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, he said, enabling the abuse of power. The free press is crumbling, he said, while social media is giving up on fact checking.\n\n“The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,” he said, stressing that social media platforms must be held accountable to protect children and families from abuse of power.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the most consequential technology of our time, he said, but could spawn new threats to individual rights and privacy unless safeguards are put in place.\n\nBiden also warned of “a dangerous concentration of power” in the hands of a few ultra-wealthy people who he said must be forced to pay their fair share of taxes and play by the same rules as everyone else.\n\nBiden and Trump:President says he urged president-elect not to 'settle scores'\n\nBiden calls for constitutional amendment\n\nHe never mentioned Trump by name, but Biden called for the passage of a constitutional amendment to make sure that no president is immune from crimes he or she commits while in office.\n\nIn July, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents cannot be prosecuted for \"official acts\" during their time in office. The court's ruling stemmed from the Justice Department's case against Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump, who was impeached twice during his first term, became the first former president to hold a criminal record after he was convicted in New York last year on 34 felonies involving hush-money payments to a porn star.\n\nHe also was indicted on multiple felony charges related to his handling of classified documents after he left office and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election leading up to an attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nBut three weeks after Trump's victory in November, a judge acting on the request of special counsel Jack Smith − who deferred to Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president − dismissed the charges that Trump tried to steal the election in 2020. Smith also effectively ended the classified documents case by dropping his appeal of a separate judge’s dismissal of those charges.\n\nBiden, however, said the president’s power is not “unlimited.”\n\n“It’s not absolute, and it shouldn’t be,” he said.\n\nTarnished legacy?How Biden’s age and refusal to pass torch earlier hang over his exit\n\n'May you all be the keeper of the flame'\n\nDuring almost every speech he has given during the past four years, Biden has ended with soaring language intended to lift up Americans and inspire them to reach for the sky.\n\n“We are the United States of America – there is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together,” he often said.\n\nHe chose different words for his sign-off on Wednesday, but the sentiment was the same.\n\nBiden said that after 50 years of public service, he still believes in the ideals for which the nation stands, that the strength of its institutions and the character of its people matter and must endure.\n\n“Now it’s your turn to stand guard,” he said. “May you all be the keeper of the flame.”\n\n“I love America,” he concluded. “You love it, too. … Thank you for this great honor.”\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Refresh often for updates.\n\nAfter three campaigns for president, the day Biden finally became president ended with a bang.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his inauguration day watching a massive firework show above the National Mall with his family from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House.\n\nSinger Katy Perry performed her song “Firework” as the first family looked on, the stunning display lighting up the Washington Monument.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, watched from the Lincoln Memorial, where she earlier had spoken.\n\nThe show was the finale to the \"Celebrating America\" primetime special that replaced the usual inaugural balls, which were scrapped this year due to COVID-19 concerns.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nBiden: 'I will give my all to you'\n\nIn a coda to his inauguration speech, President Joe Biden made one more plea for the nation to come together during an appearance Wednesday night at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n“This is a great nation. We're good people,” Biden said during the “Celebrating America” program that was the final event of a day of inaugural activities. “To overcome the challenges in front of us requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity.”\n\nCalling the pandemic and the economic, racial justice and climate crises threats to the democracy, Biden cast the current moment among past chapters in history that divided the nation. Behind him was the statue of President Abraham Lincoln, who tried to keep the nation from being torn apart over the Civil War. Not far away on the National Mall was the memorial to Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nBiden said the question is whether the nation can “meet the moment like our forebears had.”\n\n“I believe we must, and I believe we will,” Biden said, before delivering a final promise: “I will give my all to you.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden won’t address re-election plans until later\n\nHours after Biden became the oldest person to be sworn in as president, spokeswoman Jen Psaki was not specific about whether Biden plans to run for re-election.\n\nPsaki said Biden, 78, will wait until “sometime into his first term to speak more about his political plans moving forward.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump filed paperwork to run for re-election on his first day.\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons, a friend of Biden’s, recently told Politico that Biden “is planning to run again.”\n\nPsaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden’s focus is “not on politics.”\n\n“It is on getting to work and solving the problems of the American people,” she said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden 'felt like he was coming home'\n\nPress Secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had an \"incredible sense of calm\" as he entered the Oval Office for the first time as commander-in-chief on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"He felt like he was coming home,\" Psaki said of Biden, who spent eight years at the White House under Barack Obama's administration. \"That was an emotion that overtook him today.\"\n\nPsaki said that Biden also expressed a \"sense of joy\" as he spent the day with his family and grandchildren as he settled into his White House residence.\n\nThe president is also \"eager to get to work,\" she added, noting that he was already quizzing aides about policy, COVID-19 plans and \"what's next.\"\n\nBiden signed 15 executive orders and two directives in the hours after he was sworn in, unwinding his predecessor's policies on immigration and environmental regulations as well as a mask mandate on federal properties.\n\nPsaki said the administration consulted the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel on all executive actions in advance of Biden's signing of them following his inauguration.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden spokeswoman says no pending call between Biden, Trump planned\n\nThere is no call between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump planned immediately, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.\n\nPsaki said the letter Trump left for Biden was private, but it was “both generous and gracious.”\n\n“I wouldn't take it as an indication of a pending call with the former president,” she said.\n\nBiden said earlier Wednesday that Trump “wrote a very generous letter,” but did not share the contents of the letter, saying it was “private” and he would “not talk about it until I talk to him, but it was generous.”\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden to bring back regular COVID-19 briefings\n\nThe Biden administration plans to back bring back regular briefings by health officials to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, marking a return of something Trump months ago abandoned.\n\n“What we plan to do is not just return these daily briefings, Monday through Friday,” said Biden press secretary Jen Psaki, holding her first daily press conference, “but also to return briefings with our health officials.”\n\nPsaki was answering how the Biden administration plans to combat disinformation about COVID-19.\n\n“There are a number of ways to combat misinformation. One of them is accurate information, and truth and data, and sharing information even when it is hard to hear.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to call Canadian prime minister\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s first call to a foreign leader will be to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Biden plans to call Trudeau on Friday. The two leaders will discuss the “important relationship” between the two countries and will likely talk about Biden’s decision revoke a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, Psaki said.\n\nBiden’s cancellation of the pipeline permit rescinds Donald Trump's approval of a project long criticized by environmentalists.\n\nTrudeau said he was disappointed by Biden’s action but that he recognized the new president was fulfilling a campaign promise.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden spokeswoman promises 'truth and transparency'\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s press secretary began her first briefing on Thursday with a pledge of openness.\n\nSpokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden asked her to “bring truth and transparency back to the briefing room.”\n\n“Rebuilding trust with the American people will be central to our focus in the press office and in the White House every single day,” she said from the lectern in the White House briefing room.\n\nThat doesn’t mean administration officials and the media will share the same views, she said. But, she said, they have the common goal of “sharing accurate information” with the public.\n\nAsked in the first question whether her primary role is promoting Biden’s interest or providing the unvarnished truth, Psaki said the administration is committed to sharing the truth, even when it’s hard to hear.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nSpy chief nominee Avril Haines clears Senate\n\nAvril Haines was approved as the nation's intelligence chief by the Senate Wednesday evening, the first of President Joe Biden’s nominees to clear the chamber.\n\nIn her post as director of national intelligence, Haines will oversee 18 U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies – from the CIA and the FBI to nine units under the Pentagon's purview, including the newly added Space Force.\n\nAs DNI, she will also be Biden's principal intelligence adviser as the country reckons with the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and faces a slew of foreign threats.\n\nHaines cleared the chamber after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton withdrew his hold on her nomination over questions he still had after her Tuesday confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Democrats have highlighted the need to quickly confirm Biden’s picks as a top priority, specifically the president’s nominees that deal with the nation’s security and intelligence.\n\nFor hours Tuesday, Haines was peppered with questions from senators about QAnon conspiracies and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. She vowed to remain at \"arms length\" from her boss if confirmed to the post. She said her mandate from Biden would be to deliver \"unvarnished\" threat assessments, even if it contradicts his policy preferences.\n\n— Christal Hayes and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden to political appointees: 'You work for the people'\n\nPresident Joe Biden swore in hundreds of political appointees Wednesday in a virtual ceremony in which he also issued a stern warning: Expect long hours. And always be respectful.\n\n“You work for the people. I work for the people,” Biden said from the White House State Dining Room, where he administered the oath of office to appointees to various political posts during a videoconference call.\n\nBiden thanked employees for working for him. “You’re going to work like the devil,” he said. “We all do. We all work long hours.”\n\nBiden stressed that the nation has an opportunity to eliminate systemic racism in part because of the death of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who died last May at the hands of police. Floyd’s death touched off nationwide protests for racial justice.\n\nBiden said he expects people who work for him to treat everyone with dignity and respect. If they don’t, “I will fire you on the spot,” he said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden administration will reverse military rules on transgender troops\n\nThe Biden administration intends within days to reverse the Pentagon policy former President Donald Trump ordered that limits the service and treatment of transgender troops, according to an official with Biden’s transition team.\n\nBiden’s nominee for the Defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at his Senate hearing on Tuesday that he supports reversing the policy. The policy will be rescinded after Biden’s leadership team is in place at the Pentagon, said the official who is not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTrump announced a ban on service by transgender troops by tweet in 2017, a move that caught military officials by surprise. The policy took months to develop and continues to be challenged in the courts. It effectively bans transgender people from joining the military and limits treatment for transgender troops.\n\nMajor medical and psychological associations say there is no scientific reason for banning transgender troops from serving. The Pentagon estimates there are about 10,000 transgender troops. The annual bill for those who require treatment accounts for about $3 million of the Pentagon’s $50 billion health care budget.\n\n— Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden to put pending federal rules on hold\n\nPresident Joe Biden is putting pending federal regulations on hold until his new administration gets a chance to review them.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Ron Klain issued a memo Wednesday to department heads and agencies advising them that pending federal regulations should be put on hold until they are reviewed. Any proposed rules that have been sent to the Federal Register but not yet published are to be withdrawn until they are approved and reviewed.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in December that the freeze would stop so-called “midnight” regulations. One pending rule she cited is a proposal by Donald Trump’s Labor Department that would make it easier for companies to treat employees as independent contractors. Critics argued the change could impact workers because many independent contractors don’t receive overtime pay or health benefits.\n\nThe move is also part of Biden’s plan to unwind his predecessor's policies. In his first hours as president, Biden is expected to sign 15 executive orders, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and reversing travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nKlain’s memo advises postponing for 60 days the starting date of any new rules that have been published but not yet taken effect so that they can be further reviewed.\n\n— Michael Collins and Courtney Subramanian\n\nDemocrats officially control Senate, House and White House for first time in a decade\n\nThe swearing-in of two new Georgia Democrats in the Senate marks the first time the party will control the White House and both chambers of Congress in a decade.\n\nGeorgia’s Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff were sworn into office by Vice President Kamala Harris, one of her first official duties in the role.\n\nThe two new Democrats will give the chamber a 50-50 split, which effectively would give Democrats the majority because Harris – as President of the Senate – would be the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHarris, who resigned the Senate this week ahead of her inauguration, also swore in her replacement: Democrat Alex Padilla.\n\nThe power shift marks the first time Democrats have controlled the upper chamber since 2014 and the first time in a decade that Democrats will control the House, Senate and White House. The last time was in 2011 under former President Barack Obama.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nGeorge W. Bush lauds Rep. Jim Clyburn as 'savior' after pivotal SC primary endorsement led to Biden election\n\nThe highest-ranking Black member of Congress says former President George W. Bush lauded his role as a “savior” in helping get President Joe Biden elected to the White House.\n\nU.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Wednesday on a call with reporters that the Republican former president told him ahead of the inaugural ceremony that, if he had not given Biden the boost he did ahead of South Carolina’s primary, “we would not be having this transfer of power today.”\n\nClyburn says Bush went on to say that Biden was “the only one who could have defeated the incumbent president,” Donald Trump. Trump and the Bush family didn’t get along.\n\nClyburn’s pivotal endorsement ahead of South Carolina’s Democratic primary helped propel Biden to the nomination. Biden won South Carolina by a margin of nearly 30 points.\n\nClyburn, South Carolina’s only Democratic representative in Congress, is the dean of the state’s Democrats and the third-ranking member of the U.S. House.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nBiden administration releases names of acting agency heads\n\nHours after President Joe Biden was sworn into office, White House officials released the names of the administration's acting agency heads as the president's nominees await Senate confirmation.\n\nThe move allows Biden to install members of his own team rather than rely on any of former President Donald Trump's political appointees left within the federal government beyond Jan. 20.\n\nBiden's political appointees have faced severe delays in the weeks between the president's election victory and the inauguration. Trump had his defense and homeland secretaries confirmed when he took office while former President Barack Obama had six of his nominees in place by the time he was sworn in.\n\nThe Senate began confirmation hearings just before inauguration for five of Biden's Cabinet picks, including Janet Yellen, nominee for Treasury Secretary, Tony Blinken, nominee for secretary of state, Avril Haines, nominee for director of national intelligence, Lloyd Austin, nominee for Defense secretary and Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee for Homeland Security secretary.\n\nThe list confirmed an earlier report by USA TODAY that Biden planned to tap career Justice official Monty Wilkinson to serve as acting attorney general.\n\nAmong those named, nearly all of whom are career civil servants, are:\n\nDavid Norquist, Department of Defense\n\nDavid Cohen, Central Intelligence Agency\n\nDan Smith, Department of State\n\nNorris Cochran, Department of Health and Human Services\n\nDavid Pekoske, Department of Homeland Security\n\nDavid Huizenga, Department of Energy\n\nMonty Wilkinson, Department of Justice\n\nAl Stewart, Department of Labor\n\nAndy Baukol, Department of Treasury\n\nLora Shiao, Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\nMaria Pagan, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative\n\nRob Fairweather, Office of Management and Budget\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden arrives at the White House for the first time as president\n\nPresident Joe Biden was escorted to the White House for the first time Wednesday afternoon, arriving without the thousands of spectators that historically line the streets for a traditional Inauguration Day parade.\n\nBiden held the hand of his wife Jill Biden as he walked one block from 15th Street to the White House. The couple waved at the small crowd that was in attendance. Biden ran over to greet television personality Al Roker at one point.\n\n“It feels great. It feels good,” Biden said.\n\nAnother reporter asked whether he has a message for former President Donald Trump. Biden did not respond.\n\nWhen they got to the White House door, the Bidens embraced each other as a military band played \"Hail to the Chief.\" They then entered with their family and others.\n\nBecause of health precautions during the coronavirus pandemic, a virtual “Parade Across America” replaced the traditional inauguration parade. The virtual event kicked off as Biden arrived at the White House.\n\nTrailing the Bidens in the escort was music from the marching band of the University of Delaware, Biden’s alma mater, and Howard University, where Vice President Harris graduated.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPence: 'There’s no place like home'\n\nIn his first public remarks since leaving office, former Vice President Mike Pence congratulated the new occupants of the Oval Office before thanking Donald Trump “for making America great again.”\n\n\"Thank you, President Trump, for all you’ve done for this country,\" an emotional Pence said as a spoke to supporters in his hometown of Columbus, Ind., Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPence also thanked Trump for the privilege of serving as his vice president, a task that became especially challenging in the final days when Trump unsuccessfully pressured him to try to block Congress from accepting the electoral votes.\n\nPence acknowledged all those who have lost their lives from COVID-19, saying “our hearts will always be with families that have lost loved ones in this global pandemic over the ordeal of this past year.”\n\nBut Pence, who headed the administration’s coronavirus task force, said that he will always be proud of the administration’s response to the pandemic. Those actions, he said, have brought the nation to “the beginning of the end.”\n\nPence repeatedly fought back tears as he thanked friends, family and staff. Several of his aides flew back with him to Indiana, taking the same plane that took the Pences to Washington four years ago.\n\nPence announced that he will soon be resettling in his home state, where he served as governor and as a member of Congress after a career as a radio talk show host.\n\n“While we just come back to Indiana today, I've already promised Karen we’ll be moving back to Indiana come this summer,” Pence said of his wife. “There's no place like home.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nJoe Biden: New answer to a Super Bowl trivia question\n\nJoe Biden’s ascension to the presidency expands the answer to a great football trivia question: How many colleges have produced both U.S. presidents and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks?\n\nThe answer is now five, thanks to Biden’s alma mater, the University of Delaware; the Blue Hens also produced quarterback Joe Flacco, who led the Baltimore Ravens to a Super Bowl win over San Francisco in 2013.\n\nOther schools that have produced presidents and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks:\n\nUniversity of Michigan (Gerald Ford and Tom Brady):\n\nThe United States Naval Academy (Jimmy Carter and Roger Staubach);\n\nStanford (Herbert Hoover, Jim Plunkett, and John Elway);\n\nMiami of Ohio (Benjamin Harrison and Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n— David Jackson\n\nBiden, joined by former presidents, honors the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nJoined by three of his predecessors, newly sworn-in President Joe Biden led a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in his first trip as commander in chief.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris saluted the tomb around 2:45 p.m. ET Wednesday as a solider performed “Taps,” the traditional call played at military funerals and flag ceremonies, on the bugle.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, along with their spouses, joined Biden and Harris for the ceremony. Donald Trump, who left Washington for Florida before the inauguration, was not present.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden, Harris enjoy levity with congressional leaders\n\nA traditional gift-giving ceremony reflected the joshing ease that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris enjoy with leaders of the House and Senate – a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., began his comments by mentioning each participant by title: “Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Dr. Biden, Mr. President.” But Biden interrupted, inviting him to be more casual.\n\n“No, Joe, you’re Mr. President,” Hoyer replied.\n\nThen first lady Jill Biden interjected.\n\n“Dr. Biden, he makes you call him Mr. President?” Hoyer asked. “Marriage is about to get rocky, I can tell.”\n\nHoyer joined House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in presenting framed photographs of the inauguration ceremony to Biden and Harris less than two hours afterward.\n\n“That was quick,” Biden said, as he walked up to the easel.\n\n“Modern technology, right?” McCarthy said. “It’s a good picture, too.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fierce Republican partisan from Kentucky, presented the Democrat Harris with a U.S. flag that flew atop the Capitol during the inauguration ceremony. But McConnell couldn’t let the moment pass without noting that both she and Biden had served in the Senate without serving in the House.\n\n“With all due respect to our distinguished speaker and our colleagues from the House, I have to note not only did we just swore in a son and daughter of the Senate to these offices, but indeed both of these former senators skipped the House altogether,” McConnell said to chuckles.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., presented two custom made, Lenox crystal vases. One of the White House was for Biden and one of the Capitol was for Harris. But she noted they are heavy, weighing 32 pounds each.\n\n“Jill, I know, is very strong and could pick them both,” Klobuchar said.\n\nThe gift-giving usually occurs during a luncheon that was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., opened the session by saying he had little time to choose a painting that traditionally provides a poignant image for the event.\n\nBut he had little time to choose a painting, so Jill Biden recommended one from Robert Seldon Duncanson, a Black painter. The landscape completed in 1859 featured a rainbow on the right side\n\n“The rainbow is always a good sign,” Blunt said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden signs inaugural proclamation, nomination documents\n\nStill at the Capitol after being sworn into office, Biden signed the inaugural proclamation around 1:25 p.m. ET, formalizing him as the 46th president, as well as documents to officially make his Cabinet nominations.\n\nThe signings are part of the procedural actions all presidents take after assuming office.\n\nNext Biden and Harris will review the readiness of military troops from the east front of the Capitol.\n\nBiden and Harris will then travel to Arlington National Cemetery where they will join former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden ends 21-minute inaugural address: ‘Thank you, America’\n\nBiden’s inaugural address clocked in at 21 minutes and ended with a call for Americans to meet the nation’s challenges with “purpose and resolve” as he thanked the country.\n\n\"With purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our times, sustained by faith, driven by conviction,” Biden said. \"My God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.\"\n\nThe speech may have seemed short, but it’s in line with the length of recent inaugural addresses.\n\nTrump’s 2017 inaugural speech was 15 minutes. Like Biden, Barack Obama spoke for 21 minutes in his 2009 inaugural address and 18 minutes in 2013. George W. Bush spoke for 15 minutes in 2001. And Bill Clinton’s inaugural addressed clocked in at 22 minutes in 1997 and just 14 minutes in 1993.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nSocial media accounts change over to Biden administration\n\nAs President Joe Biden was giving his inaugural address, accounts on various social media sites officially changed from the Trump administration over to the Biden administration - marking the end of the 45th presidency and the start of the 46th.\n\nOn Twitter, @Transition46 now owns the White House account.\n\nTwitter transferred @POTUS from former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden.\n\n@SenKamalaHarris has become @VP, and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden is under @FLOTUS.\n\nAlso, a new account @SecondGentleman has been created for Doug Emhoff, the country’s first-ever Second Gentleman.\n\nBefore Trump's personal account was permanently banned from Twitter Jan. 8, the @POTUS account was filled with retweets of the personal account. In his final days in office, Trump couldn't use the official account either after he attempted to use the @POTUS account, which Twitter said was an attempt to evade a suspension and violated its rules.\n\nThe Trump administration’s @POTUS account publicly archive is @POTUS45 and Obama's account was archived as @POTUS44.\n\nAdditionally, on Instagram, Biden now owns the @POTUS account.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann, Kelly Tyko\n\nBiden writes American story of ‘hope not fear’\n\nBiden borrowed a theme from his Democratic convention speech during the summer about choosing light over darkness in the pursuit of the public good.\n\n“We shall write an American story of hope not fear, of unity not division, of light not darkness, a story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness,” Biden said.\n\n“May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment, democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch, but thrived,” Biden said.\n\n“That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world,” Biden That is what we owe our forebears and generations to follow.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nThe ‘world is watching’\n\nTo the international audience, Biden said he knows that the world is watching.\n\nHis message to those outside the nation’s borders, he said, is: “America has been tested and we’re stronger for it.”\n\nBiden promised to repair alliances with other countries and to “engage with the world once again.”\n\nAnd, as he’s said before, Biden repeated that America shouldn’t lead by the example of the nation’s power, but by the power of example.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden on COVID pandemic: ‘We will get through this together’\n\nBiden called on Americans to combat the raging coronavirus pandemic as one nation – and said it must in order to prevail.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other,” Biden said. “We must finally meet this pandemic as one nation. We will get through this together -- together.\"\n\nBiden then led a silent prayer for the 400,000 Americans who have died from the COVID-19 virus.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden decries violence threatening democracy: ‘Not ever’\n\nBiden noted the resilience of the country enduring through violence, whether during the Civil War, protests 108 years ago against women’s suffrage, or the riot Jan. 6.\n\n“Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed during the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance,” Biden said. “Yet we endured, we prevailed.”\n\nBiden said the country was being tested, but would rise to resolve disputes without violence.\n\n“Here we stand across the Potomac, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace,” Biden said. “Here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground.\n\n“It did not happen,” Biden added. “It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Not ever.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden speaks to Trump voters\n\nAddressing those who did not vote for him, Biden asked that they “hear me out as we move forward.\n\n“Take your measure of me and my heart,” he said. “If you still disagree, so be it. That’s democracy.”\n\nEven if opponents can’t support him, Biden said, he will still fight as hard for them as he will for those who backed his candidacy.\n\n“I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans,” he said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden calls for unity: ‘Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire’\n\nIn a call for unity, Biden said, “Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire” as he called for Americans to “start fresh” and come together to meet the crises of the times.\n\n“I believe America is so much better than this,” Biden said, noting that throughout history America has prevailed over division.\n\n\"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new,” he said. “History, faith and reason show the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this challenge as the United States of America. I guarantee you that if we do that we will not fail.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n`Speed and urgency’\n\nBiden promised to press forward with “speed and urgency,” saying there is much to do in” this winter of peril.”\n\nFew people have been more challenged or found a time more challenging, Biden said. Many jobs have been lost, businesses have closed and there’s a cry for racial justice.\n\n“The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer,” Biden said.\n\nHe pledged to confront and defeat the rise of political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism.\n\nBut doing so will require the most important part of democracy, he added: unity.\n\n“For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage,” he said. “Unity is the path forward.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden notes bipartisan recognition of inauguration\n\nBiden welcomed former presidents of both parties to his inauguration, welcoming to them to “this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago, violence sought to shake the Capitol’s very foundation,” to carry out the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama sat behind him. Biden said he spoke with former President Jimmy Carter, who was unable to attend, but whom Biden saluted for his lifetime of service.\n\nBut Biden’s immediate predecessor, former President Donald Trump, flew to Florida on Wednesday morning rather than attend the event. Former Vice President Mike Pence did attend the event.\n\n“I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today,” Biden said. “I thank them from the bottom of my heart.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden begins inaugural address: ‘This is democracy’s day’\n\nAfter being sworn in as president 12 minutes before noon, Biden began his inaugural address declaring, “Democracy has prevailed.”\n\n“This is America's day,” Biden said. “This is democracy’s day, a day of history and hope, of renewal of resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew. And America has risen to the challenge.\"\n\n\"Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people -- the will of the people -- have been heard.\"\n\nThe inauguration came two weeks after the Capitol was under assault by a group of pro-Trump supporters who stormed Congress while it was counting electoral votes.\n\nBiden was introduced to the podium by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a chair of the Inaugural Committee.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden officially sworn in as 46th president of the United States\n\nJoe Biden was sworn in Wednesday as the 46th president of the United States, marking the official start to an administration that must now turn its attention to the global coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil and deep divisions about the state of American politics and leadership.\n\nForty-eight years after he entered Congress as the junior senator from Delaware, Biden stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and recited the oath of office enshrined in the Constitution - words that have been spoken by his predecessors, dating back to President George Washington.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office.\n\nFacing a raging pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans, the inaugural festivities were stripped of much of their pomp and circumstance, but the symbolism of the peaceful transfer of power - a bedrock principle of American democracy - was nevertheless clear. Lawmakers and former presidents of both parties and members of the Supreme Court, wearing masks as they took their seats, were on hand to witness the ceremony.\n\nBiden, 78, takes the helm at a precarious moment in U.S. history, as the nation continues its struggle with the deadly virus and the logistical challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of people. He also enters office just days after a mob supporting former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, underscoring simmering tensions in national politics that Biden must confront to advance his agenda.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nKamala Harris sworn in as vice president, making history as first woman of color in the office\n\nVice President Kamala Harris took the oath office in a barrier-breaking ceremony Wednesday that recognized her the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American to hold the office.\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, was sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a trailblazer in her own right as the first Latina justice on the high court.\n\nShe used two bibles previously belonging to the late civil rights icon and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Harris has said inspired her career path, and family friend Regina Shelton, who was like a second mother to Harris and her sister. Harris used Shelton's bible when she took the oath of office as California Attorney General and later as a U.S. senator.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden, Harris introduced at inauguration ceremony\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and wife Dr. Jill Biden were introduced at the inauguration ceremony at 11:18 am. They walked out the Capitol’s west doors, down the steps and were greeted with applause.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff were introduced shortly beforehand.\n\nIt came after former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Supreme Court justices and outgoing Vice President Mike Pence took their seats. The introductions occurred around the same time outgoing President Donald Trump, who is not attending the ceremony, landed in Florida on Air Force One.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a chairwoman of the Inaugural Committee, began the ceremony by acknowledging the attack on the Capitol two weeks ago by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nShe said it “awakened us to our responsibility as Americans.”\n\n“This is the day when our democracy picks ourselves up, brushes off the dust and does what America always does: goes forward as a nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nLawmakers put partisanship, attack on Capitol aside for the day\n\nAhead of Biden’s inauguration, lawmakers said they were hoping to put aside partisan bickering for the day and were determined not to be intimidated by the attack earlier this month at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“This is what it's all about. It's a peaceful transition of power, not what happened last week,'' Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., said referring to the Jan. 6 attack. He said it's important for both parties to work together. “We’re all great Americans and this country will move forward peacefully,” he said. “It's a great day for America.\"\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle said it was important to show resilience after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and said they were glad the inauguration went on as planned. “Today is about hope and opportunity,” said Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio and the new chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nIncluded among those in attendance were an array of Republican lawmakers who have vehemently opposed Biden, including some who objected to counting Electoral College votes in hopes of overturning results for Trump.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin, who was among those, said Inauguration Day was not the time for partisanship.\n\n“On a day like today, for a moment, our country pauses in some of those most spirited of debates, but I am sure it will be renewed in earnest once President Biden is sworn in,” Zeldin, R-N.Y., said. “I think the key is how we debate, and how we disagree.”\n\nZeldin noted the intense divisions in the country, something he said would take time to mend.\n\n“I'm not going to make believe that our country is imminently on the verge of this perfect healing and unity that is going to start, you know, miraculously two hours from now,” he said hours before Biden’s inauguration. “I think we have to look really, not just in how we engage on these issues short term, but also this is a conversation for long term.”\n\n— Christal Hayes and Deb Barfield Berry\n\nPomp and circumstance … for a smaller crowd\n\nThe crowd may be smaller, but there’s still a lot of pomp and circumstance for Joe Biden’s inaugural.\n\nThe front of the Capitol is adorned with large American flags. The Marine Band is serenading guests with patriotic music. The arrival of dignitaries is announced over a loudspeaker and with a drumroll.\n\nTickets for the swearing-in ceremony were strictly limited as a safety precaution because of the coronavirus pandemic, which means a much smaller crowd than previous inaugurals. In past years, the West Front lawn has been packed, and those who weren’t fortunate enough to get a seat were jammed into a standing-room-only section.\n\nThis time, seats are spaced six feet apart as a covid safety protocol. And what is normally the standing-room-only section is filled by members of the news media.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump hands out another late pardon: Judge Jeanine Pirro's ex-husband\n\nLess than an hour before the end of his presidency, President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced one more last-minute pardon: The ex-husband of For News host Judge Jeanine Pirro.\n\nAlbert Pirro, Jr., a former real estate associate of Trump's, was convicted on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.\n\nThe grant can be added to the list of nearly 150 pardons and commutations that the White House released in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n—David Jackson\n\nPence greeted by applause\n\nA hatless Mike Pence nodded at the applause as he walked onto the West Front for Biden’s inauguration. An American flag pin was attached to his overcoat. (Four years ago, Pence had to borrow an overcoat for his own swearing-in when his coat was put into the wrong limousine.)\n\nPence held hands with his wife Karen as he walked through the Capitol one last time as vice president.\n\nHe greeted former President George W. Bush when he reached the seating area for past White House occupants. He also chatted with former Vice President Dan Quayle, a fellow Hoosier.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nSen. Hawley, other Republicans who objected to Biden’s win, attend inauguration\n\nA bevy of Republicans who worked feverishly to undermine Biden’s win and objected to the Electoral College count on Jan. 6 attended the inauguration – including several leaders of that effort to block the Nov. 3 election results.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, the first Senate Republican to say he would object to the election count, attended, along with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who quickly followed Hawley’s lead. Cruz was wearing a mask that read, “Come and Take It,” with a canon and a star.\n\nAmong House Republicans, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he wanted to be part of the “pageantry” even though he repeatedly touted false claims that Biden’s win was not legitimate. He argued that key swing states “unilaterally” changed voting rules to favor Democrats.\n\n“This is as close to pageantry as we get in American,” Jordan told reporters on Capitol Hill before Biden took the oath of office. “This and the State of the Union address, and I just think it’s important that you attend those events.”\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden to install interim leadership at Justice Department\n\nThe incoming Biden administration is moving to install interim leadership at the Justice Department, tapping career Justice official Monty Wilkinson to serve as acting attorney general until the Senate weighs the confirmation of nominee Merrick Garland, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.\n\nJohn Carlin, a former assistant attorney general in Obama administration, is President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to serve as acting deputy attorney general until nominee Lisa Monaco can be confirmed by the Senate, said the source who is not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe moves come as acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen steps down Wednesday.\n\nRosen has served as the nation’s interim chief law enforcement officer since the Dec. 23 departure of William Barr, once one of President Donald Trump most prominent defenders.\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nHero Capitol Police officer escorts Kamala Harris\n\nEugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer who led rioters away from the Senate chamber on Jan. 6, is escorting Vice President-elect Kamala Harris at the inauguration Wednesday.\n\nGoodman went viral earlier this month after a video showed him leading a mob of white men away from the Senate floor, potentially saving lives.\n\nIn the viral video, Goodman, who is Black, pushes a member of the mob, a man wearing a black QAnon shirt later identified as Doug Jensen from Des Moines.\n\nAs a result, Jensen chased Goodman, who led him and the mob away from the Senate floor. The mob followed him into a group of police in a back corridor outside the Senate. Jensen was later arrested by the FBI on five federal charges.\n\nLegislation has been introduced to award a Congressional Gold Medal for Goodman.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nDignitaries arrive at Capitol\n\nSeveral former presidents are among the dignitaries arriving at the Capitol for Joe Biden’s inauguration.\n\nCongressional leaders, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and others have taken their place on the platform ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and their spouses were all introduced before taking their seats on the big stage.\n\nEach arrival is announced over a loudspeaker and, in some cases, accompanied by a drumroll.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden, Harris arrive at Capitol for inauguration\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris arrived at the Capitol at 10:30 a.m. ET before they will be sworn in as the 46h president and 49th vice president.\n\nAfter exiting the motorcade, the Senate chairs of the Inaugural Committee, Sens. Roy Blunt-R-Mo. and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., greeted them.\n\nBiden held hands with his wife Dr. Jill Biden as they walked up the steps of the Capitol and Harris held hands with husband Doug Emhoff. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell greeted the couples at the top of the Capitol steps before they entered the building.\n\nBiden and Harris waved below after reaching the Capitol’s door. The couples attended a church service earlier in the morning at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nSecurity at top of mind for lawmakers after Capitol attack\n\nSecurity remained a top focus of lawmakers arriving for Biden’s inauguration, a concern looming over the typical celebrations of Inauguration Day.\n\nLawmakers had been briefed before the event about what should happen if there was an emergency but some have taken additional precautions, such as purchasing body armor, after the attack at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month.\n\nRep. Susan Wild, D-Penn., had what she believes was a panic attack on Jan. 6 as protesters stormed the House chambers. She says she took several days to regroup after the trauma and had gone back and forth before deciding to attend Biden's inauguration.\n\n“I don't ever want to go through again what I went through on the 6th,” she told USA TODAY in an interview. “I hope we have learned something from that experience. And by we, I mean, the security forces who are charged with the responsibility of making sure that Congress is safe.”\n\nWild said she thought critically about whether she would attend Biden’s inauguration after the attack.\n\n“I kind of went back and forth on it,” she said. “But I am now feeling pretty confident about the security measures that have been put into place.”\n\nWild said the attack altered her sense of security and “it obviously puts everything in a different light, you start to really be very, very aware of your surroundings.”\n\nWild isn’t alone.\n\nRep. Peter Meijer, a Michigan Republican who voted to impeach Trump over the insurrection at the Capitol, said many of his colleagues have been thinking critically about their safety.\n\n“Many of us are altering our routines, working to get body armor, which is a reimbursable purchase that we can make,\" Meijer told MSNBC. \"It's sad we have to get to that point. But our expectation is that someone may try to kill us.\"\n\nThe scenes surrounding the U.S. Capitol have been surreal as thousands of National Guard troops have guarded blocks surrounding the National Mall and most of downtown Washington. Seven-foot fences with barbed wire were erected to further secure the area.\n\n“I feel safe for the inauguration. I like to think it's an overabundance of caution because no one likes the picture of fortress Washington,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. “It's a bit disturbing and a picture that could have been avoided.”\n\nWild said the attack has left members of Congress with a new sense of empathy for those who are targeted in attacks, such as mass shootings.\n\n“It certainly has opened the eyes of people like me who have never been in that kind of situation. It gives you a new empathy and sympathy for people who are in school shootings are or in crisis situations, not of their own making,” she said. “We all wonder how we would react. Many of us in Congress now have a sense of how we would react.”\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nBiden attends Mass ahead of inauguration\n\nAs outgoing President Donald Trump flew out of Washington on Air Force One Wednesday morning, President-elect Joe Biden attended Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, his only event before he will be sworn in as the 46th president at noon.\n\nHe was joined by his spouse Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, as well as congressional leaders from both parties.\n\nThe Bidens had a front-row pew, with Harris and Emhoff on the other side of the aisle, also in the front. The couples stood in silent reflection looking at the front altar. All attendees wore masks and were spread out in the cathedral to follow social-distancing standards.\n\nThe Bidens arrived shortly before 9 a.m. ET after taking a short trip from the Blair House, the White House guesthouse where the new first couple stayed overnight.\n\nEn route, Biden’s motorcade drove on streets guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops and storefronts boarded over with plywood after the Jan. 6 Capitol assault.\n\nBiden wore a navy suit and navy overcoat, both by American designer Ralph Lauren. Jill Biden had on an ocean blue wool tweed coat and dress by American designer Alexandra O’Neil of Markarian.\n\nCongressional leaders who attended the service included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\n\nMedia was led out of the cathedral shortly after 9 a.m. as the service was ongoing. Biden and other worshippers left the church shortly before 10 a.m. ET before departing for the Capitol.\n\n—Joey Garrison\n\nLawmakers and guests ready for inauguration, 'renewal'\n\nBiden’s inauguration is a scaled-down affair, and lawmakers weren’t allowed to bring as many guests as in years past, but they were still excited for the proceedings.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa, was so enthusiastic for the inauguration, her very first ever, that she went for a run along the river at sunrise. Some Democrats saw it as an opportunity for the nation to change after Trump.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., called it a “renewal,” and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said “maybe our nation can heal now.”\n\nAnd Pete Buttigieg, Biden’s Transportation Secretary nominee, told USA TODAY it was “really moving” to be at the inauguration, calling it an opportunity to “turn the page.”\n\nRep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., reflected on the moment, calling the inauguration, “The symbol of democracy for all the world to see. This is where it began with the ability to transfer power, even against the backdrop of a lot of anger.”\n\nFormer Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, also a Republican, said he expects Biden to model \"better behavior.\"\n\n\"It's one of the rites of passage for president and the peaceful transfer of power. The best day we have in terms of rituals, so I'm glad it's happening,\" Flake said. \"I think Americans will sleep easier knowing that we have a more steady hand in the White House. Regardless of philosophy or disagreement, we have a steady hand.\"\n\n—Nicholas Wu\n\nOne tradition followed: Trump leaves letter for Biden\n\nTrump has eschewed most traditional roles a president fills during the the transition to a successor, except one: He has left a letter for Biden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere confirmed Wednesday that Trump left a note for the incoming president. Presidents usually leave a note of congratulations and support in the Oval Office, but some had questioned whether Trump would do so given his hesitancy to acknowledge Biden’s victory.\n\nThe White House did not release contents of Trump's note: \"It’s a letter between 45 and 46,\" Deere said.\n\nDonald Trump's last day:President leaves a note for Biden before departing for Mar-a-Lago\n\n“We are just temporary occupants of this office,” President Barack Obama wrote to Trump in his own letter in 2017. “That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions – like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties – that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.”\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden to be sworn in at noon\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. is hours away from being sworn in as the 46th president of the United States during a ceremony on the U.S. Capitol steps embodying the peaceful transition of power that stands as a hallmark of American democracy.\n\nBut this will be a presidential inauguration like no other.\n\nInstead of the throngs of supporters hailing from all corners of the country to celebrate Biden's ascension, the new president will raise his right hand in front of a sparse audience of well-wishers that will not include Donald Trump – the first time since 1869 that an outgoing president has refused to attend his successor's inauguration.\n\nInstead of thousands of people gathering on the National Mall for the festivities, the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will be replaced by a virtual parade that will be televised while thousands of National Guard troops patrol the nation's capital.\n\nAnd instead of basking in the glow of his convincing electoral triumph, Biden, 78, will be taking over the nation as millions question his legitimacy two weeks after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol building over baseless claims of election fraud.\n\nMore:Joe Biden ran on bringing back normalcy. With COVID, riots and a looming impeachment trial, that task just got tougher\n\nAll this as Biden will emphasize the need for the country to come together. The theme for the inauguration will be “America United.\"\n\nShortly before noon on the steps of the west entrance of the Capitol, Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, becoming the first woman, as well as the first Black or Asian American, to assume the post.\n\nThen at roughly noon, Biden will put his hand on the Bible as Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office. His inaugural address will lay out his vision for solving the nation's problems, like a spiraling COVID pandemic and a reeling economy.\n\nWhile Trump won't attend, departing Vice President Mike Pence will be there.\n\nMore:Farewell address: Trump stresses record, condemns Capitol riot, does not name Biden\n\nPence has chosen to welcome the incoming president rather than join a planned send-off for Trump earlier in the morning at Joint Base Andrews where, the departing president will climb aboard Air Force for one final trip to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDespite the turmoil surrounding the 59th Inaugural Ceremonies Wednesday, there will be some familiar moments: a national anthem (sung by Lady Gaga), a poetry reading (by Amanda Gorman) and a musical performance (by Jennifer Lopez).\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden’s inaugural address to push unity to meet ‘extraordinary challenges’\n\nAddressing a deeply divided nation, Biden will call for unity in his inaugural speech Wednesday in an appeal to “bring the country together during an unprecedented moment of crisis,” advisors to the president-elect said.\n\nThe speech, echoing the themes the Democratic former vice president campaigned on, is expected to run 20 to 30 minutes, according to a source familiar with the speech.\n\nAfter he’s sworn in as the 46th president, Biden will address a nation on edge — one in the thick of a global pandemic that has killed 400,000 Americans and struggling to recover economically.\n\nThe speech comes amid heightened security concerns after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress counted electoral votes. Surveys have found more than 60% of Republicans who supported Trump falsely believe Trump was the rightful winner of the election.\n\nTrump, who leveled baseless claims of voter fraud to unsuccessfully overturn the election, is skipping the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend.\n\nBiden’s remarks will “be a forward-looking vision for his presidency while addressing the moment we are living in as a country,” advisors said, noting the speech is built around a theme of unity.\n\n–Joey Garrison\n\nHow does the public feel about Biden and Harris? Keener on the former\n\nKamala Harris is taking on her new role with less public support than Joe Biden has, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\n\nWhile 58% of U.S. adults surveyed this month approved of the job Biden is doing, views of Harris were more divided. Half said she’s qualified to serve as president, while 47% said she is not.\n\nFour years ago, 54% of those surveyed said Mike Pence is qualified to be president if something were to happen to Donald Trump.\n\nMost Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents – 82% -- said Harris could step in, if needed, for Biden. But nearly the same share of Republicans and Republican leaders said she is not qualified.\n\nMost Democrats said Harris will have the right amount of influence in the new administration. But seven out of ten Republicans said she will have too much.\n\n—Maureen Groppe\n\nKamala Harris will swear in new senators as VP\n\nIn her first day as vice president — the first who is a woman, who is Black, who is of South Asian descent — Kamala Harris will swear in three new senators.\n\nHer replacement, Democrat Alex Padilla, will become California’s first Hispanic senator. Padilla and Georgia Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the state’s first Black and Jewish senators, respectively, will be sworn in at about 4:30 p.m.\n\nWith these three new Senators sworn in, Harris will officially be the tie-breaking vote in a 50-50 split Senate.\n\nHarris will deliver some of her first remarks as Vice President Wednesday evening at the Lincoln Memorial as part of the “Celebrating America” inaugural program.\n\nHarris is to be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and will take her oath on two Bibles.

The other Bible belongs to Regina Shelton, a neighbor and nursery school operator who was like a second mother to Harris and her sister Maya growing up.\n\n—Rebecca Morin and Michael Collins\n\nTrump departs as Biden starts his day\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have left Joint Base Andrews at 9 a.m. on Air Force One, headed for Florida and their home at Mar-a-Lago following a speech to supporters.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, is attending mass at St. Matthews Cathedral in Washington before traveling to the U.S. Capitol for the start of his inauguration ceremony at noon ET.\n\n'We are not a regular administration'\n\nTrump bid farewell to supporters and family Wednesday for one final time as commander-in-chief in a nine-minute speech recalling his administration's successes over the last four years.\n\n\"We were not a regular administration,\" he told a crowd of supporters, family and staff at Joint Base Andrews, located in Maryland just outside Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we’ve done has been amazing by any standard,\" Trump said, recounting the highlights of his administration he has often noted during campaign rallies - the creation of Space Force, changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 2017 tax bill.\n\nThe event had the look and feel of a Trump campaign rally, with Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" blaring from loudspeakers as Marine One arrived early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe president's children and their spouses as well as his chief of staff Mark Meadows were all in attendance, lined up along the side of the podium as the president spoke. Trump took the stage as \"Hail to the Chief\" played over a 21-gun salute and the crowd cheered, \"we love you!\"\n\n\"I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success,\" Trump said of incoming President Joe Biden, never mentioning his successor by name. \"They have the foundation to do something really spectacular.\"\n\n\"I hope they don’t raise your taxes,\" Trump said in one of his only references to Biden. \"But if you do, I told you so.\"\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also spoke, telling the crowd that being first lady was her \"great honor.\"\n\nThe president's departure ceremony bucked more than 150 years of tradition of attending his successor's inauguration. He plans to be at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., when Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president at noon.\n\n\"I will always fight for you. I will be watching and I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better,\" he said as he concluded his remark before boarding Air Force One.\n\n\"So just a goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\" Trump told the crowd, thanking Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence as well as members of Congress. \"Have a good life. We will see you soon.\"\n\nThe crowd looked on as Trump took off as president for one final time on Air Force One, with Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" playing over the loudspeaker.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nPence gets brief nod from Trump\n\nAfter four years of intense loyalty followed by a major break with his boss, Vice President Mike Pence got a brief nod from President Donald Trump in the outgoing president’s final public remarks.\n\n“I want to thank our vice president, Mike Pence and Karen,” Trump said near the end of about 10 minutes of comments before he got on plane to Florida.\n\nTrump spoke at a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews that Pence did not attend. Unlike Trump, Pence will be at President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony.\n\n'Man without a home':What the future may hold for Vice President Mike Pence\n\nPence’s relationship with Trump has been strained since the vice president concluded he could not intervene to stop Congress from accepting the electoral votes on Jan. 6.\n\nAfter mentioning Pence, Trump also thanked Congress.\n\n“Because we really worked well with Congress -- at least certain elements of Congress,” he added as a made a “so-so” gesture with his hand while supporters laughed.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, with the support of 10 Republicans, voted to impeach Trump last week for inciting insurrection. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday, said the mob who swarmed the Capitol as Congress was counting the elector votes was “provoked by the president.”\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump leaves White House for last time\n\nTrump left the White House shortly after 8 a.m. ET Wednesday on his way to the Maryland base – taking his final flight as president on Marine One.\n\nTrump emerged onto the South Lawn with first lady Melania Trump at 8:12 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaking briefly with reporters, Trump said it was the “honor of a lifetime” to serve as president. Marine One lifted off the South Lawn at 8:18 a.m. ET and toured over the National Mall before heading toward Maryland.\n\nTrump, who is skipping the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, is heading to Joint Base Andrews, where he’ll take part in a ceremony, and then on to Florida. Trump is expected to make remarks at the suburban Maryland military base.\n\nThe optics of the departure from the White House was highly unusual: A sitting president generally travels to the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration of a successor. Then, the former president usually walks down the stairs with the new president and takes off from there, a potent symbol of the peaceful handover of power.\n\nTrump, the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to attend the inauguration of his successor, is heading for his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, which he dubbed the \"Winter White House.\" The White House has invited hundreds of supporters to a pomp-and-circumstance ceremony at the air base, one expected to feature a red carpet and military color guard – and perhaps a preview of another Trump presidential run in 2024.\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nBiden asks surgeon general to resign\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden asked for the resignation of Surgeon General Jerome Adams. The request is seen as one of the first steps Biden will take to chart a new course in the federal government’s response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAdams confirmed Wednesday morning that he'd \"been asked by the Biden team to step down as Surgeon General” and that it has \"been the honor of my life to serve this Nation, and I will do all I can to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve and maintain health.\"\n\nIn December, Biden announced that Vivek Murthy would reprise his role as surgeon general in the new administration. Trump fired Murthy at the beginning of his administration in 2017.\n\nAdams came under frequent criticism for mixed messaging around the coronavirus pandemic, claiming early in the pandemic that the flu was a greater risk than the coronavirus and later for comments about social distancing in communities of color.\n\n—Matthew Brown", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/joe-biden-speech-address-watch-live/76100078007/", "title": "Joe Biden's address on 2024 election results: Watch his full speech", "text": "President Joe Biden addressed the nation Thursday morning to discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' loss of the 2024 presidential election and president-elect Donald Trump's upcoming transition into power.\n\nThe speech came a day after Biden congratulated Trump on his victory over the phone Wednesday and invited him to the White House to discuss the presidential transition period – an offer Trump refused to extend to Biden after the 2020 race.

Other billionaires such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have appeared eager to develop friendly relationships with the incoming administration.\n\n\"More than a century ago, American people stood up to the robber barons back then and busted the trusts,\" Biden said. \"They didn't punish the wealthy. They just made the wealthy play by the same rules everybody else had.\"\n\nBiden warns of 'tech industrial complex'\n\nIn his 17-minute speech, Biden called it the \"highest honor of my life to lead you as commander in chief\" and recalled the situation he inherited four years ago: a country in the grip of a raging pandemic and an economic crisis just two weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"In the past four years, our democracy has held strong, and every day I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history,\" Biden said.\n\nYet his remarks were distinguished by concerns about the future. Singling out social media companies, he warned of the potential rise of a \"tech industrial complex,\" comparing it to the \"military industrial complex\" that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about in his 1961 farewell address.\n\n\"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power,\" Biden said, referencing Zuckerberg's recent announcement the company would stop fact-checking on its social media platforms such as Facebook.\n\n\"The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact-checking,\" Biden said. \"The truth is smothered by lies, told for power and for profit. We must hold the social platforms accountable to protect our children, our families and our very democracy from the abuse of power.\"\n\nMore:Tarnished legacy? How Biden’s age and refusal to pass torch earlier hang over his exit\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, the 82-year-old Biden has tried to assert a legacy defined by signature laws he pushed through in his first term ‒ with just a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate ‒ to unleash historic infrastructure spending, a resurgence of clean-energy factories and investments in the microchip industry to catch up to China.\n\n\"I'm so proud of how much we've accomplished together for the American people, and I wish the incoming administration success because I want America to succeed,\" said Biden, who did not mention Trump by name in his speech.\n\nBiden said his policies have launched \"a new era of American possibility,\" though he acknowledged some of the projects are years down the road.\n\n\"It will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together, but the seeds are planted and they'll grow and they'll bloom for decades to come,\" he added.\n\nA Mideast deal days before departure\n\nOn the foreign policy front, Biden touted his record restoring the nation's global alliances and leading international support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion and war.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden announced a long-awaited ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that will pause the war in Gaza and result in a phased release of the remaining hostages in Gaza including three Americans and the remains of four deceased Americans.\n\nTrump immediately claimed credit for the deal, writing in a post on social media that it wouldn't have happened without his election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\n\n\"This plan was developed and negotiated by my team, and it'll be largely implemented by the incoming administration,\" Biden said at the beginning of his remarks.\n\nMore:Israel and Hamas reach deal on Gaza ceasefire, hostage release\n\nBiden used his final major address to renew his call for 18-year term limits and strong ethics reforms for Supreme Court justices. He said it's time to ban members of Congress from trading stock. And he called for a constitutional amendment to make clear no president is \"immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office.\"\n\nIn July, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents cannot be prosecuted for \"official acts\" during their time in office. The court's ruling stemmed from the Justice Department's case against Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"The president's power is not unlimited. It's not absolute. And it shouldn't be,\" Biden said.\n\n'I give you my word,' Biden says\n\nBiden is exiting the White House with a mixed legacy and a favorability rating of just 34%, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll this week. Meanwhile, Americans by a 52%-45% margin now say they approve of Trump's job performance during his first term ‒ a far rosier assessment than he ever received while in office.\n\nSince the election, Biden has faced finger-pointing from Democrats who argue he helped lead to Trump's return to power by waiting until 107 days until the election to drop out of the race and thus limiting the time Harris had to mount her campaign.\n\nDespite concerns about his age, Biden announced plans to seek reelection in the spring of 2023, only to drop out last July following a disastrous debate performance that exposed an aging president who sounded incoherent at times and struggled to make his case against Trump.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has said he believes he could have defeated Trump had he stayed in the race ‒ an assessment some have interpreted as a dig at Harris.\n\nBiden recognized Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff in his speech, saying they have \"become like family, and to me, family's everything.\"\n\nThroughout his term, Biden repeatedly warned that Trump is a threat to a democracy and framed stopping him as a \"battle for the soul of the nation.\" But Biden failed in his push to make Trump a footnote in American history.

Before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule, a group of Russian oligarchs had control over most of the country’s economy. When Putin rose to power, he offered them a choice of prison or loyalty.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, his administration posted a 2018 list of hundreds of Russian politicians and oligarchs that have \"flourished\" under Russia President Vladimir Putin’s rule.\n\nSome have called China an oligarchy because leadership has remained in the hands of a few for several decades, though the nation defines itself as a communist \"people's republic.\"\n\nWhat are the main forms of government?\n\nOutside of oligarchies, here are some notable forms of government seen globally:\n\nAbsolute monarchy: A monarch rules without being hindered by other governing bodies\n\nAnarchy: Lack of governmental authority, a condition of lawlessness or political disorder\n\nAuthoritarian: State authority is imposed on citizens' lives\n\nCommunist: The state controls the economy with a single party in power. Private ownership is eliminated with a goal of all goods equally shared in a classless society\n\nDemocracy: Power is retained by the people\n\nDemocratic republic: Citizens vote for representatives who hold governing power\n\nDictatorship: A ruler or small group wield absolute power without a constitution or laws\n\nEcclesiastical: Church-administered government\n\nEmirate: Power in the hands of the ruler of a Muslim state, an emir\n\nMonarchy: Supreme power is in the hands of a monarch, usually a king or queen and usually hereditary\n\nSocialism: A central government produces and distributes goods to seek a more just and equitable society\n\nSultanate: Supreme power rests in the hands of a sultan\n\nTheocracy: A Deity is recognized as supreme leader\n\nTotalitarian: Government subordinates individuals to the state, controlling political, economic and social attitudes, values and beliefs\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/01/16/biden-farewell-address-oligarchy-musk-trump/77741732007/", "title": "Biden lectures on 'oligarchy' and 'misinformation'? Joe can't leave ...", "text": "President Joe Biden can’t leave the Oval Office fast enough.\n\nAnd his farewell address to the American people Wednesday evening served as a final reminder of why we’ll be glad when he’s gone from the White House.\n\nBiden has spent the last five decades in elected office. He should have simply focused on his career in his farewell speech, leaving with some grace.\n\nThat’s far from what he did.\n\nBiden used his final minutes in front of the camera to once again lecture the country on “democracy,” the “soul of our nation” and “misinformation.” He threw in another one, too: “oligarchy.”\n\nThese are all subjects on which Biden has zero high ground, and he succeeded in cementing his legacy as a liar and hypocrite.\n\nLet’s briefly walk through what he said.\n\nOpinion:Bye, Biden. I'm thrilled I won't have to write about illegal loan schemes again.\n\nBiden takes a shot at Trump, Musk and oligarchs\n\nAlthough Biden didn’t mention President-elect Donald Trump or billionaire (and Trump bestie) Elon Musk by name, they played a prominent role in his speech.\n\n“I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern,\" Biden said. \"And that’s the dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultrawealthy people.\"\n\n“Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.”\n\nTrump has tapped Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO and the world’s richest person, to serve as a close adviser, including with an effort to cut the size of our government.\n\nWhy shouldn’t Trump bring on one of America's best minds?\n\nThe wealthy have always had influence in politics. And Biden and the Democrats know this very well. In fact, after Biden dropped out of the race last year, Vice President Kamala Harris attracted donations from far more billionaires than Trump did.\n\nOpinion:Can Musk rein in exorbitant national debt? America's economic future is at stake.\n\nWhen Oprah, Hollywood stars and famous musicians campaigned for Harris, apparently that was all hunky-dory in Biden’s mind.\n\nYet, the world is ending if Musk – the chief innovator of our time – decides to support Trump?\n\nBiden warns of misinformation in the media. That’s rich coming from him.\n\nBiden also spent time warning of the dangers of “misinformation” and “disinformation” in the media.\n\n“I’m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country, as well,” he said. “Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power. The free press is crumbling, editors are disappearing.”\n\nGive me a break.\n\nOpinion:Biden's blanket pardon of son Hunter proves what we knew all along. He's a liar.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Biden and his bureaucrats served as threats to free speech and the dissemination of truth, whether it related to the Biden family or COVID-19.\n\nWhen he was campaigning for president in 2020, Biden claimed stories about his son Hunter’s now infamous laptop were Russian disinformation. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter faced intense pressure to censor these reports just weeks before the election. And they did.\n\nIt turns out that it wasn’t disinformation at all. It was 100% true.\n\nBiden also had the audacity to take aim at Meta, which owns Facebook, to criticize the private company’s new policy against fact-checking.\n\n“Social media is giving up on fact-checking,” he said. “The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit. We must hold the social platforms accountable to protect our children, our families and our very democracy from the abuse of power.”\n\nLast week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan about the pressure campaign from the Biden administration to censor information, even when it was true.\n\n“They pushed us super hard, to take down the things that were honestly were true,” Zuckerberg said. “They basically pushed us and said, you know, anything that says that vaccines might have side effects, you basically need to take down.”\n\nThat sounds the opposite of democratic to me.\n\nThat’s not even mentioning all the lies Biden and his advisers told for months about the president’s deteriorating health, referring to true stories about his obvious decline as “cheap fakes.”\n\nIn Biden’s parting words, he did a great job of reminding us why voters awarded Donald Trump the right to replace him next week – and why the country will be better off when he exits the stage.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

It might be tempting to see America and the world through his rose-colored glasses, but I won't be fooled. The disasters have piled up one after another these past four years while Biden was president.\n\nAnd I can't say goodbye to Biden fast enough.\n\nMillions of Americans felt left behind in Biden's economy\n\nBiden is sure to talk about what he believes is a strong U.S. economy. In a speech Friday, Biden said that the economy had made \"transformational progress\" on his watch, and that he added 16.6 million jobs.\n\nBiden did add jobs, I'll give him that. According to Forbes, employment is up 12%. Unemployment is down to 4.1% from 6.2% in early 2021.\n\nEven so, job growth couldn't ease the pain that the high rate of inflation inflicted on Americans during Biden's presidency. Consumer prices grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%. The annual inflation rate was only 1.9% during Trump's first term.\n\nThe high cost of food, housing and even used vehicles has left many Americans frustrated and discouraged. The American dream seems more like a vapor than an attainable goal.\n\nThe Associated Press' VoteCast, a survey of Americans who cast ballots in November, found that 3 in 10 voters reported “falling behind’’ financially in recent years, and that an extraordinary 90% of voters were somewhat or very worried about the cost of groceries. About 80% were concerned about the cost of health care, housing and gasoline.\n\nNo president is entirely responsible for the success or failure of the U.S. economy. But Biden continued to pile up trillions of dollars in deficit spending even after alarms about surging inflation were clanging.\n\nI won't miss a president who ignored inflation until it was too late, and I bet most Americans won't, either.\n\nBiden presided over a world on fire\n\nIn his farewell speech, Biden also will likely put a positive spin on his handling of foreign relations. On Monday, the president delivered a speech at the State Department defending his foreign policy record.\n\n\"Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,\" Biden said. \"We have not gone to war to make these things happen.\"\n\nThe reality, however, is far more grim.\n\nOpinion:My heart breaks as Los Angeles burns. But where are the city's leaders?\n\nOn Biden's watch, Russia invaded Ukraine, Hamas attacked Israel, the United States bungled its withdrawal from Afghanistan and military alliances binding China, Iran, North Korea and Russia grew stronger.\n\nAmericans are still being held hostage in Gaza after more than 15 months of captivity, and antisemitism has increased in the United States and around the globe.\n\nWe'll never know for certain what disasters might have been avoided if a stronger U.S. president had been in office. But we do know that the United States and the world enjoyed a period of relative peace when Trump was in the White House.\n\nI won't miss a president who looked weak and failed to deter war around the world.\n\nBiden refused to be honest about his health\n\nThe biggest thing I won't miss about Biden is his blatant dishonesty.\n\nThe president failed to be straight with Americans about his failing health and his ability to serve a second term. That sowed even deeper distrust among Americans at a time when the public's trust in our government is dangerously low.\n\nOpinion:Democrats lied repeatedly in 2024. Don't let them gaslight us again in 2025.\n\nHe also vowed repeatedly that he would not pardon his son Hunter, who was convicted in federal court on felony gun and tax charges. But then the president broke his vow, handing Hunter a get-out-of-jail-free card that erased 11 years' of actual and potential crimes.\n\nDespite what Biden is likely to claim in his farewell address, the truth paints a different story.

He acknowledged that voters didn't seem to agree, though, that he was on a path to lose in November to an opponent he says would endanger democracy itself. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nHis words were poignant, his manner somber. But the low timbre of his voice and his occasional stumble over the words he was reading from a teleprompter were reminders of the concerns about his age that had undermined his bid for a second term.\n\n“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden, 81, said in an echo of John F. Kennedy's inaugural address. He called it \"a time for new voices, for fresh voices, yes, for younger voices.\"\n\nBiden had announced on Sunday that he would become the first president since 1968 to choose not to run for another term. But his diagnosis with COVID-19, and the isolation that followed at his vacation home in Delaware, delayed the speech for four days − a speech he didn't want to give.\n\nThat delay inadvertently underscored how quickly the attention of the country is moving on from Biden's tenure to the fierce battle between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to succeed him. His announcement energized Democratic voters, fueled record-setting campaign donations and almost instantly united the party behind his replacement.\n\n'Doing my job' for another six months\n\nThere's still time for him to make a difference, Biden said.\n\n“Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. He said he would battle gun violence, call for Supreme Court reform, press efforts to end cancer, keep NATO powerful and united, work to end the war in Gaza and more.\n\nBut the prospects for passing significant legislation through a Republican-controlled House in the next few months is dim. While lame-duck presidents often turn to foreign policy as territory where they can still exert influence, his power to pressure foreign leaders will be complicated by their interest in and calculations about the contenders to lead the next administration.\n\nHe endorsed Harris on Sunday, and he praised her in his speech as experienced, tough and capable.\n\nFor Biden, the durability of his legacy is now in her hands.\n\nHarris' election in November would ratify the wisdom of Biden stepping back, even belatedly, and put in office a successor with a consistent agenda and commitment to preserving his achievements.\n\nBut her defeat this fall would fuel blame aimed at Biden for his decision last year to seek a second term, despite concerns about his age from the start. It would put back in power Trump, who has mocked and derided Biden's agenda and vowed to dismantle it.\n\nIt was just the fourth time Biden had addressed the nation from the Oval Office, a more solemn venue than the sunlight and greenery of the Rose Garden.\n\nBiden had used the Oval Office for a speech just three times before to speak to the American people − first at a time of triumph, when the Fiscal Responsibility Act had finally passed in June 2023. Then on two more calamitous occasions, to discuss the Israeli-Gaza conflict four months later, and just 10 days ago to address the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson already had delivered messages from behind his desk 26 times − on topics from race riots on U.S. streets to bombing campaigns in Southeast Asia − when he scheduled an Oval Office address in March 1968 to talk about the Vietnam War.\n\nTo the astonishment of even some close aides, LBJ closed the 40-minute address by announcing he would devote the rest of his term to seeking peace, not another term. \"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president,\" he said.\n\nThe discouragement of history for lame ducks\n\nBiden's speech was shorter, and his message didn't come as a surprise. Like LBJ, though, he vowed to pursue big goals in his final months in the White House.\n\nHistory isn't encouraging when it comes to big ambitions for lame ducks.\n\nEven the phrase \"lame duck\" doesn't sound promising − literally, a duck with a game leg, a target for predators because he can't keep up with the rest of the flock. The phrase was coined in the 18th century at the London Stock Exchange to describe a stockbroker who defaulted on his debts, then was adapted to American politics in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1968, Johnson was unable to achieve his stated goal of achieving peace in Vietnam; that was left to successor Richard Nixon. In 1952, Harry Truman as a lame duck tried and failed to end the war in Korea; that was achieved by successor Dwight Eisenhower. In 2000, Bill Clinton's intensive efforts at a Camp David summit to reach a comprehensive agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians came close but fell short.\n\nThe exception was George W. Bush, who in the final months of his tenure in 2008 faced a financial crisis and was forced to back a huge bank bailout that most of his own party opposed.\n\nNot the legacy he wanted, either.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}]}

But where is most toilet ...", "text": "The strike this week by dockworkers at ports on the East and Gulf coasts has sparked a new cottage industry: people in New Jersey and elsewhere posting photos on social media of empty store shelves, indicating an apparent run on toilet paper, water bottles and other essentials.\n\nIf you remember the bare shelves seen during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing shutdowns and business closures in March 2020, this might invoke familiar scenes.\n\nBut the supposed run on toilet paper may be ill-founded.\n\nThe port closures — which come after a strike started Tuesday with 47,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association walking off the job — affect imports and exports into and out of the United States.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\nAnd roughly 90% of American toilet paper is produced within the U.S., said the California-based Center for Land Use Interpretation.\n\nThe largest producers of American toilet paper are Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Georgia-Pacific, all three of which own and operate plants across the continental U.S.\n\nBut that has not stopped apparent raids on toilet paper, paper towels and water bottles, reports of which have streamed in on social media.\n\n“Grocery stores in my area of NJ are bonkers right now. Got out there earlier to pick up paper products and a few other items before it's gone. Hoarding begets hoarding unfortunately. I only snagged one big thing of [toilet paper] and paper towels,” Mike Bolitho of South Jersey said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nHowever, a quick spot check Wednesday morning of a Jack's Super Foodtown in Caldwell and a ShopRite and a Stop & Shop in West Caldwell found shelves fully stocked with toilet paper, paper towels and bottled water. A Home Depot in Montville also had plenty of those items — as well as stacks of boxed artificial Christmas trees.\n\nSpot checks of Target in Clark and ShopRite in Garwood, on the other hand, found much lower levels of toilet paper.\n\nAnd the Costco in Teterboro had plenty of bottled water but was sold out of toilet paper Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDaniel Wolk, a spokesperson for the grocery chain Stop & Shop, said its stores \"are currently seeing an increase in the sales of paper products.\"\n\nAnd Karen O'Shea, a spokesperson for Wakefern, the cooperative that oversees ShopRites in New Jersey, said that \"some stores have seen an increase in shoppers seeking those products. But it's important to note that most groceries and household items are produced domestically and not affected by the port strike.\"\n\nWhy the panic buying?\n\nThe arrival of goods such as toilet paper on your local store shelves is dependent on a fine-tuned and fragile supply chain, Rutgers supply chain professor David Dreyfus wrote in February this year.\n\n“After the first early weeks of the pandemic, demands for goods escalated,\" Dreyfus wrote. \"This renewed demand ballooned to extreme levels in many industries. With greater demand and fewer workers, businesses and suppliers could not keep up. The complexity and structure of our supply chains were working against us.”\n\nDemand for toilet paper surged as consumers hoarded rolls in anticipation of a shutdown that was slated seemingly to go on indefinitely, but “production had halted.”\n\nEventually, as the world reopened, production resumed, Dreyfus noted, from loggers harvesting timber to paper mills turning wood into paper, manufacturers churning out rolls of toilet paper and truck drivers getting them to nearby stores.\n\nOne study at Macquarie University in Australia looked at panic buying across the Western world during the COVID-19 pandemic and found that many panic buyers and hoarders reacted to the uncertainty and stress of the pandemic.\n\n“A large amount of research has linked hoarding problems to intolerance of uncertainty and distress,” the study said.\n\nNo need to panic\n\nThe apparent panic buying at some stores in response to the port strike flies in the face of assurances made by public officials ahead of the port closures.\n\n“People do not need to rush out to the grocery stores and stockpile goods,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a Monday press conference.\n\nJackie Bray, commissioner of the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, said it would be a matter of “weeks, not days” of a strike before any impact would be felt by the average consumer.\n\nFurther mitigating the impact on consumers is that many consumer products are already “in warehouses. They’ve been there for a long time,” Bray said.\n\n“There might be a product here or there, but it’s weeks before regular consumers feel it,” she said.\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100 and Facebook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/17/food-banks-see-worst-rate-of-hunger/71505220007/", "title": "Food banks need your help. Tips to help lower a worsening hunger ...", "text": "Hunger in America is unabating, and in 2023, safety nets meant to catch people at their most vulnerable are seeing spikes in visits compared to last year.\n\nFood bank leaders from all corners of the country tell USA TODAY their neighborhood pantries are serving more people while using less resources, as economic pressures continue to ravage the budgets of low-income Americans and service providers alike.\n\nSince pandemic-era boosts to government food aid ended earlier this year in many states, families are turning to food banks to close a gap in need that feels like it has no end in sight. The level of hunger is so great, some food bank CEOs compare the current moment to past economic recessions.\n\n“From where I’m sitting, after 28 years of food banking, what we have is the logical result of 40 years of dire economic inequality,\" said Susannah Morgan, president of Oregon Food Bank.\n\nFood bank budgets have been buckling under inflation in 2023, causing some nonprofits to buy less food and cut back on services.\n\nData released this fall from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed food insecurity increased in 2022 for the first time in more than a decade.\n\n\"This is the worst rate of hunger in my career,\" said Morgan, who has worked at food banks in Boston, San Francisco and Anchorage, Alaska. “It’s so large, it’s hard to wrap your head around.\"\n\nHolidays bring extra pressure\n\nDuring the holidays, parents, and especially moms, feel even more pressure to provide for their families, said Eric Cooper, CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank.\n\n\"The last year they’ve been falling behind,\" Cooper said, and when around 300 families left the San Antonio Food Bank with turkeys in-hand this month, he said, they felt \"reassurance\" that they could create positive memories during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nSo many parents recall holiday memories of their own, laden with the aromas of turkey and gravy, said Sherrie Tussler, CEO of Wisconsin's Hunger Task Force food bank network.\n\n\"All of us have these memories,\" Tussler said. \"We can see our parents cutting the food. We can taste it. We can see our grandma cutting a pie.\"\n\nWhen people can't afford all the ingredients that go into making a special holiday meal, \"that makes you sad – sadder than sad,\" she said.\n\nBehind the scenes, food bank staff and volunteers feel \"a lot of pressure at this time of year,\" as they frantically purchase turkeys and other food items to help satisfy the country's gaping need, Tussler said.\n\n“I don’t know if we can keep up,\" Morgan said. \"We’re going to keep up for the next six or nine months, but in three years, I don’t know if we can keep up.”\n\nHow can I donate food?\n\nDonating money or nonperishable food to food banks, pantries and soup kitchens in your local area or neighborhood will go a long way to bolster their budgets and allow them to help more people, Tussler said.\n\nThe more localized the organization is, the better, she said, explaining that smaller nonprofits have smaller budgets and less resources to begin with.\n\nNear Fort Myers, Florida, the Gladiolus Food Pantry this month is asking for donated frozen turkeys, stuffing, mashed potatoes, canned or jarred gravy, cranberry sauce, canned green beans, canned corn and chicken or beef broth.\n\nThe food pantry serves over 200 families living in Lee County once a week. Many are still recovering from tourism industry jobs lost to Hurricane Ian. In the past month, 40 new families came each week, said staffer Mary Burns.\n\n\"When you go into the supermarket and they're having a buy-one-get-one, get them. That way you can use one, and donate one,\" Burns said. \"Drive around your neighborhood and look for the signs that say, 'food pantry here on Sunday,' and see how you can help your neighborhood.\"\n\nYear-round, the pantry always needs food and kitchen items that people normally don't think of, and things that kids enjoy, Burns said, especially:\n\nKids cereal.\n\nShelf-stable milk that doesn't need to be refrigerated until after its open, like Parmalat, and some nut milks.\n\nCooking oil.\n\nPeanut butter and jelly.\n\nSpices.\n\nTuna.\n\nMacaroni-and-cheese.\n\nSpaghetti.\n\nCan openers.\n\nLocal news organizations, such as newspapers or radio stations, may have articles online listing different food banks and pantries in your area. Donating to church food pantries is also a great way to get started.\n\nThe homepage for FoodPantries.org lists tens of thousands of food banks across the country where users can search by state and city. The USDA's website lists more than 250 of the agency's eligible distributors here.\n\nFood bank demand points to economic problems\n\nIn Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Tussler's network of 47 food pantries are an economic bellwether, she said.\n\n\"Right now, the numbers just look bad,\" she said.\n\nThis year across Milwaukee County, food pantries saw a 50% increase in visits after extra pandemic-era SNAP allotments ended in Wisconsin in March. During the same time period, and with the same SNAP cut-off, Morgan's food bank network in Oregon saw the same: a 50% spike in demand, she said.\n\nThose increases, combined with inflationary pressures on food banks mean the nonprofits are \"having to ration the food they provide because they see how long the line is,\" Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn Oregon, Morgan said she worries how much longer current patterns can continue before something in the system breaks completely.\n\n“I worry about a vicious cycle,\" she said. \"I worry about 40 years of income inequality hitting a place where it’s very difficult for us to recover from – hitting an irreversible trend.”\n\nDonations, government resources dropped in 2023\n\nFood bank leaders said monetary donations from the public swelled in 2020 and 2021 during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It felt like a moment when the nation came together to help those most in need, Tussler said.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, stimulus checks and the expanded child tax credit helped bring poverty in the U.S. to record lows. But when government resources began drying up in 2022, poverty rates swung back in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, food pantries across the country are getting less monetary donations from the public because everyone is feeling inflation's pinch too, Babineaux-Fontenot said.\n\nDue to the national health emergency in 2020 and 2021, the federal government flooded food banks with food commodities through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\nThis year, it feels like \"there is no additional food coming from the federal government,\" Tussler said, which is \"exacerbating some of the challenges we have.\"\n\n\"It's the perfect storm of things dragging things down,\" Babineaux-Fontenot said.\n\nOn the East Coast, the Food Bank for New York City had to scale back its longstanding low-income tax-refund filing assistance program due to budget constraints, said Zac Hall, who runs programs at the nonprofit.\n\n\"We weren't naïve to think the amount of support we received during COVID would be sustained, but the demand has still not gone back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hall said.\n\nIn the Alamo City, Cooper gave the same answer: “The need has stayed up and the support, year over year, has been shrinking.\"\n\nInflation hasn't eased for food prices\n\nAfter inflation peaked in June 2022, high prices have come down a little in 2023. But unlike most other consumer categories, inflation in grocery prices has remained stubbornly high.\n\nBecause a greater share of poor Americans' income is spent at the grocery store, inflationary food prices take a heavier toll on their budgets, Hall said, adding that seniors he works with have to decide between paying for medicine and procedures or having meals.\n\n\"Those are really hard and inhumane decisions to be made, and that's not something that we want to see be sustained,\" Hall said.\n\nIn San Antonio, Cooper said families he serves routinely report they can't afford apples, berries and tomatoes. When that happens, he said, people buy more of cheaper items that aren't as healthy.\n\n\"We’re still at such a high rate of inflation on so many food categories that diets have shifted,” Cooper said. “Families tend to move into more boxed dinners, carbs, starches, cheaper belly-fillers.\"\n\nPeople can improvise to save money at the grocery store, but other areas of a family's budget, like housing and gas, are much more fixed, he said.\n\n\"For every household budget, rent eats first,\" Cooper said.\n\nAmong other factors, food insecurity can be measured by lack of variety in one's diet, according to the USDA. In 2022, more Americans reported eating lower quality diets or skipping meals entirely, the agency reported.\n\nFood stamp program needs to be strengthened, food banks say\n\nFood banks can only support struggling Americans so much, because getting a bag of groceries is not the same as putting money in someone's pocket who needs it, Hall said.\n\n\"We are not a replacement for SNAP,\" he said. \"SNAP is the largest and best anti-hunger program we have in the country.\"\n\nCooper calls SNAP \"our nation's first line of defense\" against hunger, one that helps families in a direct way, while also filling some gaps food banks will never be able to satisfy.\n\n“It’s so dignifying for a family to be able to go to their grocery store and select the items that are culturally relevant,\" Cooper said. \"And it accommodates religious preferences.\"\n\nThis fall, as Congress delays talks on the Farm Bill, which funds SNAP, Babineaux-Fontenot said lawmakers shouldn't be allowed to get away with adding restrictions to funding meant for the most vulnerable in society.\n\n\"Isn't it remarkable that in the middle of a pandemic with supply chain crises and all that was going on, that we actually saw a decrease in food insecurity rates,\" she said. \"Let's not trick ourselves into believing we don't know that we know how to do this.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/07/kraft-velveeta-cheese-shortage/4358509/", "title": "Cheesy shortage: Kraft says Velveeta running low", "text": "Bruce Horovitz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nKraft didn%27t give any specific reasons but said such shortages happen from time to time\n\nSeasonal demand may be a factor\n\nIf this story wasn't about the Velveeta cheese shortage, you could say it was full of holes.\n\nNo holes in the orange-colored, highly-processed cheese food, of course. But, perhaps, some holes in the Kraft Foods explanation about why some stores are running out of the stuff known as Liquid Gold to Velveeta lovers but widely lampooned by some food aficionados.\n\nIt all began with an enterprising report in Advertising Age, the trade publication, that noted some East Coast grocery stores were running out of Velveeta cheese -- and didn't know why.\n\nKraft declines to discuss the specific reasons for the shortage. It did, however, email USA TODAY this explanation from spokesperson Jody Moore \"This is really a short-term issue that's more noticeable right now given the increased seasonal demand.\"\n\nSeasonal demand? For Velveeta?\n\n\"It's not a seasonal product,\" says Ken Albala, a culinary historian who teaches a class on \"History of Food\" at University of the Pacific in Stockton, Ca. \"There is no dish served between Thanksgiving and Christmas that is quintessentially Velveeta.\"\n\nWhat's more, says Albala, if there's one cheese product on the planet that should never run out, it's Velveeta. \"The whole point of Velveeta is you keep it on the shelf indefinitely. It's the cheese for people who don't know how to cook.\"\n\nMaybe so. But the 86-year-old processed cheese product, commonly melted into mac & cheese, grilled cheese sandwiches and casseroles, remains a $500 million-plus brand for Kraft. Never mind that in 1931, no less than the American Medical Association granted Velveeta its seal of approval.\n\nBut why today's shortage? Sure, Velveeta costs a lot less than real cheese, but Albala doesn't think this shortage is some statement about the still-wobbly economy. Nor does he think it was a staple for New Year's Eve dips. Velveeta may see a spike in interest around Super Bowl time, he says, but that's nearly a month away.\n\nAlbala thinks, perhaps, some very popular cooking TV show, website or magazine recently posted a recipe -- or recipes -- that called for Velveeta as an ingredient. \"That's all I can think of,\" he says.\n\n\"It is possible consumers may not be able to find some Velveeta products on store shelves over the next couple of week,\" says Kraft's Moore, in the release. But, the release notes, \"we have not heard many complaints from consumers so far.\"\n\nAlbala says he certainly has no complaints about the Velveeta shortage. \"I prefer real cheese,\" he says. Even at 49-years-old, he notes, \"I've never bought it in my life.\"\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2024/11/20/cost-inflation-turkey-thanksgiving-food-dinner/76440841007/", "title": "Thanksgiving dinner costs dip for 2024: Turkey, meal prices", "text": "Thanksgiving dinner is once again expected to cost a bit less, according to an annual survey released on Wednesday.\n\nSince 1986, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been analyzing the cost of a market basket of foods needed to make a traditional holiday meal, giving shoppers an idea of what to expect.\n\nA traditional dinner will cost 5% less than last year, according to the survey.\n\nThis year’s feast for 10 people came in at $58.08, or less than $6 per person, according to the survey. It’s the second year of decline. In 2023, the cost of the market basket of food items decreased 4.5% overall.\n\nIn this year’s survey results, the group noted that those “declines don’t erase dramatic increases that led to a record high cost of $64.06 in 2022 for the traditional meal.”\n\nWhile lower in cost, the traditional Thanksgiving meal still costs 19% more than in 2019, or pre-pandemic.\n\nBringing the cost of this year's meal down is the turkey, or the centerpiece of the traditional Thanksgiving meal. Turkey prices, the group said, are down 6% over last year.\n\nMore:Turkey: Here’s what the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving table will cost this year\n\nAn average price for a 16-pound turkey is $25.67, or $1.68 per pound, according to the AFBF survey.\n\n“The turkey is traditionally the main attraction on the Thanksgiving table and is typically the most expensive part of the meal,” said AFBF Economist Bernt Nelson. “The American turkey flock is the smallest it’s been since 1985 because of avian influenza, but overall demand has also fallen, resulting in lower prices.”\n\nVolunteer shoppers checked prices Nov. 1-7, ahead of traditional holiday sales at many grocery stores. The farm bureau said its volunteers checked prices in person and online using grocery store apps and websites and shopped for the best prices without using special promotions.\n\nNow, as we are closer to Thanksgiving, many grocery stores have frozen turkeys at bargain prices of 49 cents and as low as 33 cents a pound with store loyalty member programs.\n\nFor its informal survey, the farm bureau includes the turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, and pumpkin pie with whipped cream to serve 10 people\n\nNearly all the ingredients in this year’s survey decreased in price. A 14% drop in whole milk was due to favorable weather, the farm bureau noted. And the increase in the dinner rolls and stuffing (both are up 8%) they said was because of “higher labor costs, among other drivers, are increasing the cost of processed food.”\n\nTh farm bureau also noted that cranberry prices are up year-over-year by nearly 12% but were down 18% last year.\n\n“We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America’s families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,” said farm bureau President Zippy Duvall in a news release. “America has one of the most affordable food supplies in the world. In order to maintain that, we need a strong farm bill.\"\n\nIn addition to its list of classic Thanksgiving food items, the farm bureau added boneless ham, russet potatoes, and frozen green beans. Adding those items brought the overall cost to $77.34 for a dinner serving 10 people.\n\nHere are the individual surveyed item prices\n\n16-pound turkey: $25.67 or $1.68 per pound (down 6.1%)\n\n14 ounces of cubed stuffing mix: $4.08 (up 8.2%)\n\n2 frozen pie crusts: $3.40 (down 2.9%)\n\nHalf pint of whipping cream: $1.81 (up 4.7%)\n\n1 pound of frozen peas: $1.73 (down 8.1%)\n\n1 dozen dinner rolls: $4.16 (up 8.4%)\n\nMiscellaneous ingredients to prepare the meal: $3.75 (down 5.1%)\n\n30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix: $4.15 (down 6.5%)\n\n1 gallon of whole milk: $3.21 (down 14.3%)\n\n3 pounds of sweet potatoes: $2.93 (down 26.2%)\n\n1-pound veggie tray (carrots & celery): $.84 (down 6.4%)\n\n12-ounce bag of fresh cranberries: $2.35 (up 11.8%)\n\nBy region, the farm bureau found the Midwest had the third-most affordable cost for the classic meal at $58.90. For the expanded meal, which included the classic plus boneless ham, russet potatoes, and green beans, the cost was $83.04, also ranking the Midwest third most affordable. The most affordable for the classic meal was in the South at $56.81 ($81.07 for expanded) followed by the Northeast at $57.36 ($81.37 for expanded). In the West, the cost jumped to $67.81 for the classic meal and $94.09 for the expanded meal.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press food and restaurant writer Susan Selasky and send food and restaurant news and tips to: sselasky@freepress.com.

At the grocery store, however, the price of basic food items such as eggs, meat, and bread have all increased by at least 40% in recent years, despite tame national inflation.\n\nNationwide, food prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased 31.5% from 2005 through 2015, faster than general inflation over that period. The price of eggs more than doubled over the period reviewed, by far the largest increase of any grocery item. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 24/7 Wall St. examined consumer price changes from 2005 through 2015 for more than 300 goods and services. These are the grocery items driving up your bill the most.\n\nSickness and disease of livestock are the primary reasons for many food price increases. An avian flu outbreak in August 2015 forced farmers to kill millions of egg-laying chickens, contributing to the 110% increase in the price of eggs in the 11 years through 2015. Similarly, a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus swept through the hog industry in 2013 and 2014, killing millions of pigs. Perhaps as a consequence, prices of bacon and sausage increased by 34.5%, and hot dog prices rose by 43.5%.\n\nThe Best (and Worst) States for Business\n\nParticularly dry or extremely rainy seasons in food growing regions can also have a significant impact on consumer food prices. For example, grain such as wheat is highly susceptible to flooding that can occur in Plains states where most of the U.S. crop is grown.\n\nRising food prices not only increase Americans’ grocery bills, but also can impact restaurants, which could be forced to amend portion sizes or entire menus to stave off shrinking margins. Restaurants may even decide to fire workers, forcing some service industry workers to contend not only with higher food prices, but unemployment as well.\n\nTo determine the grocery items driving up your bill the most, 24/7 Wall St., reviewed consumer price indices from 2005 through 2015 for over 300 goods from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Definitions for each food category also came from the BLS.\n\nThese are the groceries driving up your bill the most.\n\n1. Eggs\n\nEggs had by far the largest increase in consumer prices from 2005 through 2015, with prices increasing more than 110%. Prices peaked in August 2015 after an avian flu outbreak forced farmers to kill millions of egg-laying chickens. Even before the outbreak, the price of eggs had increased more than any food item. Still, egg prices fell 13.8% from their August high.\n\nCities Where Crime Is Plummeting\n\n2. Tobacco and smoking products\n\nConsumer prices of tobacco and smoking products — including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and some e-cigarettes, among other products — have soared 92% from 2005 through 2015, nearly triple the average price increase of all grocery products. The largest price increase occurred in early 2009 when the federal tobacco tax increased by 62 cents to $1.01. Cigarette prices may rise even further. President Barack Obama has proposed an additional 94 cent tax increase, though it has not garnered much support.\n\n3. Margarine\n\nRising margarine prices have been largely driven by the supply and demand for butter, a close substitute. According to one estimate, an average American consumes nearly 6 pounds of butter each year, up from 5 pounds in 2010. International demand for butter and margarine has also grown as many developing countries expand their food service industry. Meanwhile, since the recession, many dairy farmers have gone out of business due to low milk prices and droughts in California. This has significantly restricted the supply of dairy products, causing a price increase in butter, which potentially forced would-be-butter-users towards margarine.\n\n4. Uncooked ground beef\n\nConsumer prices of uncooked ground beef increased by more than 65% from 2005 through 2015, more than double the increase in food prices generally. The price of all beef and veal products increased by 56.2% over the same period. Severe drought throughout the U.S. in 2012 led to a spike in corn prices, the primary feed grain of cows and other animals. This induced many cattle farmers to bring a larger share of their herd to market to avoid higher feeding costs and drove the total number of cattle in the country to 87.7 million, the lowest since 1951.\n\n5. Shelf stable fish and seafood\n\nLike many of the grocery items with rapidly increasing prices, both supply and demand factors have influenced the price of shelf stable fish and seafood, which includes canned fish. According to the USDA, certain fish species — such as tilapia, salmon, and many shellfish — face increased demand, particularly from China. As is the case in other food markets, rising feed costs have also contributed to the decline of fish populations such as tuna and shrimp.\n\nSee the rest of the top 20 here:\n\n20 Groceries Driving Up Your Bill The Most\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Now, markets across America are bracing for a major winter storm that could keep store shelves empty even longer.\n\nA significant winter storm headed toward the Midwest, South and East Coast over the long holiday weekend is poised to deliver another blow to grocery sellers struggling to keep enough supplies of everyday essentials — milk, juice, produce, soups and meats — in stock.\n\nSevere weather events are notorious for triggering grocery stockpiling by consumers, said Miguel Gomez, Robert G. Tobin professor of food marketing at Cornell University’s Dyson School of Applied Economics.\n\n“These winter storms are unfortunately going to add delays to an already strained supply chain,” he said. “I do think shoppers will see out-of-stocks in stores for certain grocery products.”\n\nMiah Daughtery took this photo of empty shelves at a Trader Joe's in Bethesda, MD, on January 9. Courtesy Miah Daughtery\n\nThe timing of the storms couldn’t be worse for supermarkets. In recent days, consumers around the country have unleashed their frustration on social media, posting photos on Twitter of bare shelves at Trader Joe’s locations, Giant Foods and Publix stores, among many others.\n\nMiah Daughtery posted a photo on Twitter on Jan. 9 from a Trader Joe’s location in Bethesda, Maryland, showing multiple shelves that were picked clean of produce and other food items. “This was 4 o’clock in the afternoon. This store is always stocked at that time,” she said.\n\nDaughtery was so surprised that she approached an employee to ask if the store was closing. She was told that grocery supplies were low because the delivery truck was delayed by the weather storm that has moved up the East Coast last weekend. “There was not a single egg at the store, no fresh fruit, no garlic. Basically the day-to-day staples were sparse,” said Daughtery.\n\nOn Thursday, Daughtery went to a nearby by Giant Food store. “There was no ground chicken and the dairy items were almost wiped out,” she said.\n\nFrozen goods, meats, cookies, juices paper products in tight supply\n\nSupermarket chains nationwide currently are dealing with tighter supplies of all kinds of food and household goods, according to the latest data from market research firm IRI.\n\nAccording to IRI, grocery stores in the best of times are stocked 90% to 95% across product categories. Consumers start to notices gaps on store shelves when inventory falls below 90%.\n\nIRI’s data for the week ended Jan. 9 showed supplies of several food and beverage categories were below that threshold: frozen and refrigerated meats were below 90%, frozen baked goods were at 69%, and fruits, cookie and breakfast items all fell below 90%. Refrigerated beverages were at 88% and refrigerated dough took the steepest drop to 60%.\n\nElsewhere, sports and energy drinks, juices, pet care and paper products were also below 90% supply for the week.\n\nA shopper passes by depleted refrigerated shelves at a Target store January 12 in Springfield, Virginia. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAs product supplies thin out, shoppers are having to absorb higher food prices.\n\nTeresa Hinke was at a Wegmans store in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, earlier this week and said she’s frustrated with both supply chain issues causing empty shelves and food prices skyrocketing.\n\n“I stopped into Wegmans and I was shocked,” she said. Hinke bought some chicken but wasn’t able to get the fresh seafood she was hoping to buy. “The flank steak was over $25 and scallops were $32.99 a pound,” she said, adding that a nearby ShopRite store was better stocked.\n\nBe flexible\n\nThe onslaught of severe weather events, even in a typical year, tends to disrupt the grocery supply chain.\n\n“It’s usually short-lived and then we move on,” said Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations with FMI, the Food Industry Association, an industry trade group.\n\nBut, because of Omicron and large absenteeism in the food industry, winter weather setbacks are making the supply chain function more complex, said Baker.\n\nSpecifically, he anticipates consumers in affected areas ahead of the approaching storms will stock up. “It’s human nature to respond to what we see and hear. It will happen,” said Baker.\n\nEmpty shelves at a Wegmans supermarket on January 9 in Alexandria, Virginia. mpi34/MediaPunch /IPX\n\nHis advice: Given the tight supplies in foods stores, shoppers should try to be flexible.\n\n“If your favorite brand is not on the shelf, find a substitute,” Baker said. “Resist hoarding. If you take a little bit more than what you need, it can compound the situation.”\n\nDaughtery said she’s not stockpiling groceries and will try to be creative with groceries she already has at home.\n\n“When the pandemic started I kept a running supply of staples at home,” she said. “The worst case scenario is I can always bake a cake and eat it if I run low in the next couple of days.”\n\nShe plans to check out her local farmers markets soon to buy fresh produce she couldn’t find at Trader Joe’s.\n\n“I’m blessed but I am checking in on my elderly neighbors who can’t access grocery stores or have supplies in abundance,” said Daughtery.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/natural-living-newbie/2015/01/19/natural-living-newbie/21758429/", "title": "Natural Living Newbie: I am my father's daughter", "text": "Cheryl Makin\n\n@CherylMakin\n\nAs a vice president of purchasing for various cookie companies, my dad was notorious for taking forever in the grocery store. He read every label, especially in the cookie aisle. He would compare one product against another, patiently taking the time to explain to us the benefits of some and the detriments of others. As he would show us that cocoa in this cookie is not real chocolate or the oil in this item is superior to that item — we would sometimes respond with the ever obnoxious and timeless eye roll that he always would catch out of the corner of his eye. Growing up, our family stayed away from this brand or that as they were deemed \"the enemy\" - for reasons of competition or poor ingredients. It would take what seemed like hours to just pick up a short list.\n\nFor my dad, now retired, it's still a fun adventure to head to the grocery store, peruse the aisles and see what's new in the land of labels. The irony - or perhaps sweet justice - is now, there I am with him. I have become an avid ingredient checker. I am my father's daughter.\n\nAs I have decided to head into the world of natural living because of a preservative sensitivity, labels on foods, medicine and other products loom even larger. I used to look at them for calorie, sodium and carbohydrate content. I even checked out the ingredients for food allergy reasons. But, I glossed over the words I couldn't quite pronounce - the ones I knew were not from the earth, but man-made. They didn't really matter right? All that has changed.\n\nJust a day or two into our preservative-free journey, my daughter Rebekah and I took a ride to Whole Foods Market in Marlboro. New to really reading labels for preservatives (we always looked them over for allergy reasons), we spent more than three hours touring the store under the tutelage of Jill Rizzi, the healthy eating and cultural demonstration specialist at the Whole Foods Market. Long after my eyes were crossing from the confusion of which \"ite\" was what, Jill continued to read every label on every item we picked up. Not just looking for preservatives, she took the time to understand more.\n\nBoth Bekah and I have food allergies – tree nuts, pineapple and coconut. (No, I have never had a pina coloda). I have other food allergies – strawberries, apples, peaches, pears, plums (Yes, healthy is not easy!) and Bekah is lactose intolerant. We are now Jill's biggest cheerleaders. This was an amazing personalized free-of-charge service that I did not expect. When we asked if we were taking up too much of her time, she responded that this was her job. Everyone in every department that Jill introduced us to and we spoke to were gracious and knowledgeable. In this day and age of \"too busy, go ask someone else\" it really was a welcome and almost out-of-body experience. Who grocery shops happy? It's usually a more cranky, \"I don't want to be here\" experience. We were smiling and I was almost giddy.\n\nAs we got to the produce aisle, Jill explained that there are certain items where the organic title matters most. She called them the \"dirty dozen,\" and they included celery, peaches, strawberries, apples, domestic blueberries, nectarines, sweet bell peppers, spinach (kale and collard greens), cherries, potatoes, imported grapes and lettuce. Some of these we bought fresh and others we bought frozen. Some we didn't buy at all. (Don't like celery!)\n\nFor our use, she stressed that anything else we intend to use the rind or skin on, such as lemons or potatoes, should definitely be organic. Thanks to a Martha Stewart suggestion, Bekah and I like to drink lemon water every day. Full of Vitamin C, It is high in antioxidants and is considered an excellent immune booster. (And who can't use a little immune boosting!)\n\nThis Dirty Dozen list, and another called the Clean 15, were compiled using data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the amount of pesticide residue found in non-organic fruits and vegetables after they had been washed.\n\nJill also explained that organic is the easiest way to go. Items labeled organic means that the foods and products have been grown and processed in a particular manner. They must meet certain requirements in order to be certified and labeled as organic. Simply, they must be farmed in safe soil, have no modifications, no synthetic pesticides may be used and be separated from conventional products. There are also rules for livestock with regards to the animals' feed - must be organic - prohibition of antibiotics, growth hormones or animal by-products and they must have access to outdoors. Another key is that organic items do not use chemical preservatives in them.\n\nWe were cautioned that labels should always be checked. Lots of organic products use almonds or coconut in their content. While it may be \"healthy\" for many, for us, not so much. There are also many products out there that also do not use preservatives and use organic ingredients, but due to the expense of organic certification, cannot label themselves \"organic.\"\n\nSo, we filled the cart with our pantry staples to get us started. I haven't replaced everything yet, but the main categories have gotten their overhaul. Next up is spices and more in the meat department. While our Whole Foods mentor Jill is vegan, we are not headed down that road. Fish, poultry and some beef is still on our menu.\n\nSo, I spent my paycheck at Whole Foods Market. Seriously, I was more than pleased with the prices for what I needed. I had been warned by many that I would find \"going organic\" expensive, but for what I got – a newly stocked pantry – it was not. And it wasn't my whole paycheck… maybe more than I originally thought, but I'll actually remember my coupons next time. (They like to stay perched on my kitchen table while I shop.) Whole Foods also had a booklet of coupons and specials for its customers.\n\nAnd back to expense, it really was not. Though choosing the organic label can be more than the non-organic, it did not double our bill. While it wasn't pennies more, I'd say the difference for most items was still well under the dollar amount per item. And we stocked up on Whole Foods own \"365\" brand, most of which also came in an organic option. I also restocked an entire pantry, something that will not happen every visit.\n\nI also send an apology to anyone in the aisles with me. I'm probably standing in your way reading labels. Until I get the hang of this, I'm that slow poke looking slightly confused, muttering and googling on her iPhone while squinting at the side of a package. If you see me, stop and say hi. I'm there for the duration.\n\nCheck out the Whole Foods Market website at www.wholefoodsmarket.com. You will find the latest coupons for your particular Whole Foods of choice at http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/coupons and can print them directly from the website. You can always pick up a booklet at a store as well.\n\nHave questions for Jill? She can be found at Jill.Rizzi@WholeFoods.com. She also hosts a variety of classes and events every month with topics concerning healthy eating, fitness and natural living. You think they will let me move in there?\n\nAnd by the way, thanks dad. If it wasn't for you trying to teach us the art of label reading all these years, I probably would give up. Your lessons stuck. (And not just the ones in the grocery aisle.) I'm proud to join the ranks of the ingredient checker army and your grandchildren are enlisting as well. Without eye-rolls and heavy sighs.

Read more.\n\nAmericans could face high prices and shortages again this holiday season but this time, it would be because of a worker strike instead of a global pandemic.\n\nAs of Thursday, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) said labor talks with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) remain at a standstill, and about 45,000 of its union workers at 36 East coast and Gulf Coast ports are ready to walk on Oct. 1 for the first time since 1977. The ILA is looking for higher wages and protections against automation.\n\nA strike could lead to shortages of certain items and boost prices for voters already frustrated with housing and food inflation, experts said. The ports handle about half of U.S. ocean imports, including food, clothing, auto parts, cars shipped via container and holiday toys, experts said.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of The Toy Association.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nDiversification didn’t work\n\nAfter clogged post-pandemic ports on the West Coast kept more than 150 container ships waiting to dock in February 2022, according to the Department of Transportation, companies began shipping more of their wares through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, experts said.\n\nSimultaneously, to cut their reliance on China, which was slow to reopen and faced more intense government scrutiny after the pandemic, companies began sourcing from different countries, especially southeast Asia, said Chris Tang, distinguished professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in supply chain management.\n\nMany companies shipping goods from southeast Asia use East Coast ports because they’re closer, he said.\n\n“Because of these changing dynamics, the East Coast (strike) impact is more pronounced,” Tang said.\n\nWhat products will be affected?\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,” Tang said. “And air ship is very expensive.”\n\nElectronics, like cell phones and computers, now come from southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, Tang said.\n\nPharmaceuticals, although these are easier “to ship by air because they are a higher value product, but there could be drug shortages if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so,” Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore, Maryland, leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. The East Coast ports also surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, said Jason Miller, interim chair of Michigan State University's department of supply chain management. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nCan companies reroute shipments?\n\nJonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation trade group, said some companies prepared early by:\n\nTaking cargo in earlier than normal\n\nRerouting some shipments to West Coast ports\n\nHowever, those steps are limited. “Retailers can’t bring everything in,” he said.\n\nSome companies may face inventory space constraints, while perishable food products and other goods don’t have any good alternative routes, Tang said. The Panama Canal operations are recovering from droughts, Red Sea ships have been attacked by Houthi rebels, and the Cape of Good Hope takes much longer, he said.\n\nBesides, “given the long lead time for toy products, significant quantities are already in transit with shipping logistics having been in place for months,” Ahearn said. “This makes it extremely difficult to rework scheduled shipments or product already undefined to the U.S. market through the East Coast or Gulf ports.”\n\nFlashback:Black October is here: Transport delays, labor shortages slow supply chain as holiday shopping begins\n\nIf there’s a strike, length is important\n\nThe period that follows a strike can also be disruptive, some experts said.\n\n“It’s not just about shut down but also about the recovery period, and how long it takes to get things up back and running,” Gold said.\n\nGenerally, one strike day would take three to five days to catch up, and “the longer the strike goes, the more that’s compounded,” he said.\n\n“In 2002, when we had an 11-day lockout on the West Coast because of labor negotiations, that cost (the economy) a billion dollars a day and took six months to recover and get stuff out,” Gold said. “Trade is higher now than in 2002 so it could take even longer.”\n\nBack then, the Bush administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to reopen. The Act allows the federal government to seek a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations during an 80-day cooling off period.\n\nWill the Biden administration help?\n\nThe Biden administration has declined to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act. Instead, White House officials encouraged ongoing discussions despite pleas for help from retail, agriculture, commerce, auto care, toy and other groups for months.\n\n“It’s an election year so Biden may intervene to help (Democratic presidential nominee Kamala) Harris,” Tang said. “On the outside, he may not say it but behind the scenes, he might help negotiations because it’s important to Harris. Any chaos could affect the election.”\n\nCharacterizing US supply chains and the economy as \"more resilient than they were when we came into office,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said, \"the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force is up and running – and is prepared to respond swiftly to help minimize potential disruptions in the event of a prolonged strike by engaging extensively with the ports, state and local officials, industry, labor, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies.\"\n\nNo matter what, the story ends with higher prices\n\nIf port workers strike, Americans may see price increases soon, experts said.\n\nIf port workers agree to a deal, “labor costs go up,” Tang said. “So down the road, consumers still pay a higher price. Consumers will have to learn to adjust and adapt, but unfortunately, things will be more expensive.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\" Harris told a cheering crowd at the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris spent much of 2024 campaigning as President Joe Biden's running mate. But on Thursday, she talked to the party that swiftly rallied around her after he ended his reelection bid. She laid out how she would address the major debates facing the nation, ranging from abortion rights to the southern border and the economy.\n\nThe vice president's speech comes after her own running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, delivered his acceptance address on Wednesday, telling his fellow party members \"Thank you for bringing the joy to this fight.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the Democratic convention in Chicago.\n\nHarris pledges to ‘stand strong’ with Ukraine, work to end war in Gaza\n\nHarris pledged to “stand strong” with Ukraine and NATO and said she is working “around the clock” to end the war in Gaza.\n\n“Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia’s plan to invade,” she said. “I helped mobilize a global response, over 50 countries, to defend against Putin’s aggression. And as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”\n\nOn the war in Gaza, Harris said “now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.”\n\n“Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” she said. “Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7.”\n\nShe also said “what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating.”\n\n“The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages is released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nReproductive rights get center-stage moment in Harris’ speech\n\nBashing her opponent and the GOP’s record, Harris highlighted reproductive rights as a key issue in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n“Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said of Trump and Republicans. “And one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women?”\n\n“Well, we trust women,” she continued, adding that as president she would “proudly sign” legislation to enshrine abortion access.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been the leading voice in the current Biden administration on reproductive rights and abortion access – a winning issue for many Democrats since 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris vows to bring back bipartisan border deal Trump bashed\n\nHarris said that after decades in law enforcement, she knows the “importance of safety and security, especially at our border.”\n\n“Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades,” she said. The bill was killed by Senate Republicans in February after pressure from Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,” she alleged. “Well I refuse to play politics with our security. And here is my pledge to you as President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'New path forward'\n\nHarris told convention attendees that her campaign is all about charting a “new path forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class.”\n\n“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success, and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said.\n\nHarris said that, if elected, she would pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. She said her term would also also allow Americans to “fully make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” she said, referring to reproductive rights and other matters.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump hits Harris and her speech\n\nNot exactly breaking news: Donald Trump gave bad reviews to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.\n\nIn a constant stream of Truth Social posts, Trump assailed the vice president's remarks on items ranging from the condition of her former home city of San Francisco to inflation, immigration and relations with other countries.\n\nAfter Harris accused him of wanting to be an autocrat, Trump concluded by saying: \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she’s weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\"\n\nAt another point, Trump pointed out that Harris and President Joe Biden have ignored the issues that came up in the speech: \"No specific programs, ALL TALK, NO ACTION - Why didn’t she do it three and a half years ago.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris zeroes in on Trump in convention address\n\nKamala Harris called out former President Donald Trump by name in her acceptance speech, saying the former president is “in many ways ... an unserious man.”\n\n“But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,” Harris said.\n\nPointing to what she called the “chaos and calamity” of his first term, Harris raised alarms about her 2024 opponent.\n\n“Consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for.\"\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nHarris accepts presidential nomination\n\nKamala Harris formally accepted her party’s presidential nomination, as the Democratic convention comes to a close Thursday.\n\n“On behalf of every American regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey ... I accept your nomination,” Harris told the crowd.\n\nDemocrats had officially nominated Harris in a virtual vote earlier this month and affirmed the decision at the convention Tuesday in an enthusiastic celebratory roll call.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris calls Biden’s character ‘inspiring’\n\nHarris began her remarks thanking President Joe Biden, who ended his reelection bid and immediately endorsed her candidacy.\n\n“To our President Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” Harris said.\n\n“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring, and Doug and I love you and Jill, and are forever thankful to you both,” she added.\n\nShe said that the path to get to the nomination was “no doubt unexpected but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIlhan Omar: “Mistake” not to platform Palestinian voice\n\nOn Thursday evening, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. She has not explained if or how her approach to the conflict would differ from Biden’s.\n\n—Laura Gersony\n\nRoy Cooper calls Kamala Harris ‘one hell of a fighter’\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper acknowledged he’s not the main event of the night.\n\n“Hello, America,” he said. “I’m Roy Cooper, the last guy standing between you and the moment we’re all waiting for.”\n\nCooper, a former North Carolina attorney general, told the audience how he worked with Harris when she was California’s attorney general, when she insisted on holding out for a bigger settlement from the nation’s big banks after the 2008 housing crash.\n\n“She went toe to toe with some of the world’s most powerful executives, and she refused to give in,” he said. “Let me tell you, this was a huge risk, but she knew it was a risk worth taking. That’s Kamala. And we all know what happened. The banks caved.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ sister, Maya Harris, pays tribute to their mother\n\nMaya Harris, Kamala Harris’ younger sister, opened her remarks by reflecting on her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.\n\n“Mommy was so many things to so many people, a civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her two little girls,” said Maya Harris. “But most of all, Mommy was a trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself. And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote. Do not report rumors. FOCUS.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report that according to a representative for the singer, \"Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there.”\n\nLeading up to the DNC, fans speculated the megastar might perform. Of course, Walz has been deemed a certified Beyhive member. And Beyoncé's camp gave Harris approval to use her song \"Freedom\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on her campaign trail. The song has become an anthem for Harris' campaign.\n\n− Liz Schubauer\n\nAnother Republican for Harris addresses Democratic audience\n\nSaying he was “proud to be in the trenches” with the evening’s crowd, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021. He was one of two Republicans to serve on the House committee investigating the insurrection at the Capitol. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” Kinzinger asked.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nEva Longoria calls on Democrats to say ‘she se puede’\n\nActress Eva Longoria put a new twist on a popular chant as she urged the crowd to root for Harris’ success. Longoria told the crowd to take the Spanish phrase, “Si se puede,” meaning, “yes we can,” and turn it into “she se puede.”\n\nWhen somebody asks, ‘Is she going to be the first female president of the United States?’ we’re going to say, ‘She se puede,’” Longoria said.\n\n“We know how to work so let’s get to work,” she said. “Let’s turn all of this enthusiasm and joy into action between now and November 5th. Let’s go!”\n\nShe walked offstage to chants of “she se puede!”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nGretchen Whitmer takes the stage at the convention\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer made a point to share her nickname with convention attendees at the beginning of her remarks.\n\n“In Lansing, they call me governor, but in Detroit, they call me Big Gretch,” she said, adding that women across America GST- “Get Stuff Done.”\n\n“At 29 I joined the sandwich generation sandwiched between working and raising my newborn and caring for my mom, who was dying from brain cancer. It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store? That's what the chauffeur is for,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRuben Gallego leads Democratic veterans onstage, tells Trump to ‘show some respect’\n\nArizona Senate nominee Ruben Gallego led a group of Democratic veterans, including members of the U.S. House and Senate, onstage, urging Donald Trump to “show some respect” to veterans.\n\n“We were proud to wear the uniform,” said Gallego, a congressman who served in the Marines. “And we’re proud serving our countries in city halls, state capitols, the U.S. House and the Senate. These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\n“John McCain was an American hero,” Gallego said. “Show some respect.”\n\n“Trump’s Project 2025 would slash veteran benefits and force VA hospitals to close across the nation,” he said. “Show some respect.”\n\n--Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMark Kelly says Trump ‘dreaming’ of becoming a dictator\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said Harris will stand with America’s allies and is “the leader we need right now.” Harris, he said, understands the importance of international alliances like NATO, and of supporting Ukraine in its war defending itself from Russia’s invasion.\n\n“Donald Trump skipped his intelligence briefings,” Kelly said. “He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself.”\n\nKelly referred to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that said Trump described fallen service members were “suckers” and “losers.” Trump denies the report.\n\n“Trump thinks that Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are suckers and losers,” Kelly said. “If we fall for that again and make him the commander in chief, the only suckers would be us.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miler\n\nDenied a speaker, pro-Palestinian Democratic delegates make new demand on Kamala Harris\n\nStymied in their demand that a Palestinian-American be allowed to speak to the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, a group of uncommitted delegates ended a protest outside the United Center on Thursday with a new demand: that Vice President Kamala Harris meet Arab-American and Muslims in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThey also set a deadline for such a meeting or meetings to take place of Sept. 15.\n\nWhile not saying what they would or would not do if a meeting did not take place to discuss their insistence that the U.S. stop shipping weapons to Israel and demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the organizers suggested there would be ramifications. Those could potentially involve holding back in terms of organizing on Harris' behalf in the fall campaign or arguing her case to voters.\n\n−Todd Spangler, Karissa Waddick and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nGroup shares harrowing stories about gun violence\n\nA group took to the stage at the convention Thursday night to retell somber stories about the loss of their loved ones from gun violence. One of the stories was from Abbey Clements, a former second grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Twenty-six people were killed at the school in a mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nKim Rubio recalled when her daughter Lexi walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, for the last time.\n\n“It’s 10:30am at Robb Elementary in Uvalde,” Rubio said. “The school is recognizing my 10 year old daughter, Lexi, for receiving all A's. She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved. I'll keep calling and I'll keep fighting,” McFadden said. Edgar Vilchez, whose friend was killed in a shooting at their high school, said that moment changed him. “Instead about worrying about taking a test, I started worrying about living to take another test,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nShooting survivor and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords takes the stage\n\nPart of a series of speakers to address gun violence, mass shooting survivor and former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona appeared Thursday to recount her experience.\n\n“Terrible, terrible day. I almost died,” Giffords said of an assassination attempt in 2011 that killed six and left the congresswoman severely injured.\n\n“But I fought for my life, and I survived,” she continued.\n\nGiffords was joined on stage by her husband, Sen. Mark Kelly. She began her speech by telling the crowd she was “born with grit.” And, she said, Harris too “has grit.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is singing with P!nk?\n\nThe singer P!nk performed her hit some \"What About Us\" at the Democratic convention, taking the stage with her daughter, Willow.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden says he spoke to Kamala Harris ahead of her acceptance speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, just got off the phone with Kamala Harris ahead of her acceptance speech. He shared a picture of the first couple standing in front of a television showing the convention, a phone in his hand.\n\n“Jill and I just spoke to @KamalaHarris — we can’t wait to watch her accept this historic nomination,” Biden wrote in the post.\n\n“Kamala and Tim will inspire a generation and lead us into the future,” he wrote, referring to vice presidential nominee Tim Walz.\n\nThe Bidens spoke Monday on the convention’s first night, before ceding the spotlight to Harris and Walz.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ loved ones, Meena Harris, Ella Emhoff and Helena Hudlin, speak out in support\n\nA trio of Kamala Harris' loved ones paid tribute to the vice president on Thursday.\n\nMeena Harris, niece of Kamala Harris, said that her aunt “showed me the meaning of service, helping her sister, a 17 year old single mom, fighting for justice for the American people, and still cooking Sunday family dinner.”\n\n“She guided me. Now she's guiding my own children, and I know she'll guide our country forward,” said Meena Harris.\n\nElla Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, said that the vice president came into her life when she was 14 - “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked.\n\n“Like a lot of young people, I didn't always understand what I was feeling. But no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring, and always took me seriously. She's never stopped listening to me, and she's not going to stop listening to all of us,” Emhoff said.\n\nHelena Hudlin, goddaughter of Harris, said that Kamala Harris’ advice “means everything, whether it's pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn't feel so hopeful.”\n\n“She taught me that making a difference means giving your whole heart and taking action,” Hudlin said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKerry Washington brings 'Scandal' costar Tony Goldwyn, Harris family members on stage with her\n\nActress Kerry Washington helped host the final hours of the Democratic convention’s final night.\n\nShe brought back to the stage her former “Scandal” costar Tony Goldwyn, who days earlier also made a convention stage appearance. And in a moment that appeared to be targeted at Republicans’ mispronouncing of Harris’ first name at the GOP convention last month, Washington was joined by the vice president’s young grandnieces, Amara and Leela.\n\n\"Confusion is understandable. Disrespect is not,” Washington said. “So tonight, we are going to help everyone get it right.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nThe Chicks perform the National Anthem\n\nThe Chicks, the award-winning country band, performed an a cappella version of “The Star Spangled Banner” to a packed convention hall.\n\nMembers Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer stood onstage at a single mic as they sang the anthem.\n\nAfter they finished, the crowd began chanting “USA. USA.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nTexas Senate candidate Colin Allred calls Donald Trump, Ted Cruz ‘me guys’\n\nTexas Senate nominee Colin Allred called former President Donald Trump and his own Republican opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ‘me guys’ who are out for themselves. Allred, a member of Congress from Dallas and a former NFL player and civil rights lawyer, introduced himself to the crowd as “the guy who’s going to turn Texas’ Senate seat blue.”\n\nHe said in the NFL, the term they’d use to describe Trump and Cruz is “me guys.”\n\n“You know the type. Talk a big game, only care about themselves,” he said. “But you don’t want to be stuck with them at a barbeque.”\n\n“We’ve got a message for the ‘me guys,’” he said. “‘We’ is more powerful than ‘me.’ We will protect and restore reproductive freedom. We will secure the border. We’ll protect Medicare and Social Security. And we’ll turn the page and write a new chapter for this country: Elect Kamala Harris to be the next president and beat Ted Cruz.”\n\nAs Allred walked offstage, the crowd chanted “beat Ted Cruz.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nConvention broadcasts video of Steph Curry\n\nThe convention featured a pre-recorded video of famed basketball player Stephen Curry, who just won gold in the 2024 Olympics. Curry began his remarks saying that unity on and off the basketball court “reminded us all that together, we can do all things and continue to inspire the world.”\n\n“That's why I believe that Kamala as president could bring that unity back and continue to move our country forward. This is about preserving hope and belief in our country, making sure families can be taken care of during the most precious times,” he said.\n\nCurry noted that he visited Harris with his team at the White House last year, and said he can tell attendees something he knew then that he definitely knows now: “the Oval Office suits her well.”\n\n“So, in the words of Michelle Obama: do something! Go vote! Be active!” he said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMaxwell Frost calls on voters to back Kamala Harris 'for our planet'\n\nRep. Maxwell Frost of Florida, the first Gen Z member of Congress, called on Americans to vote for Harris “for our planet.”\n\n“The climate crisis isn’t some far off threat,” Frost said. “It is here.”\n\nA former organizer for the student-led gun control advocacy group March for Our Lives, Frost said the Biden-Harris administration has already been making progress addressing climate change.\n\n“This election is about every drop of water that we consume and every breath we breathe,” he told the crowd. “Fighting the climate crisis is patriotic.”\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nDeb Haaland says Kamala Harris will fight for ‘clean air, clean water and healthy communities’\n\nSecretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said Harris will tackle climate change, pointing to her record as California attorney general and vice president.\n\n“An American president must lead the world in tackling climate change,” Haaland said. “We need a president who understands that assignment. That’s Kamala Harris.”\n\nShe praised Harris’ record holding polluters accountable for oil spills, defending former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan in court and casting the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a range of climate provisions.\n\n“Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will fight for a future where we all have clean air, clean water and healthy communities,” Haaland said.\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nAntron McCray, Central Park Five speak out against Trump: ‘45 wanted us unalive’\n\nThe Central Park Five, a group of Black and Latino men who were wrongly accused of assaulting a white female jogger in 1989, bashed Trump on stage. The former president had bought out full-page advertisements calling for the death penalty after the attack\n\n“35 years ago, my friends and I were in prison for a crime we did not commit. Our youth was stolen from us. Every day as we walked into courtroom, people screamed at us, threatened us because of Donald Trump,” said Korey Wise, one of the members of the group.\n\nYusef Salaam, now a member of the New York City Council, said that “45 wanted us unalive.’\n\n“That man thinks that hate is the animating force in America. It is not. We have the constitutional right to vote. In fact, it is a human right, so let us use it. I want you to walk with us. I want you to march with us. I want you to vote with us,” said Salaam.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAl Sharpton said Kamala Harris’ nomination will ‘realize Shirley Chisholm’s dream’\n\nActivist Rev. Al Sharpton told the DNC crowd, “Tonight, we are going to realize Shirley Chisholm’s dream” when Harris accepts the nomination.\n\nChisholm was the first Black woman elected to Congress. In 1972 she became the first Black candidate to run for a major party’s nomination and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party’s nomination.\n\n“Fifty-two years ago I was one of the youth directors in her campaign for president,” Sharpton said of Chisholm. “And 52 years after she was told to sit down, I know she’s watching us tonight as a Black woman stands up to accept the nomination for president of the United States.”\n\nHe contrasted Harris’ record with Trump’s on voting rights, civil rights and more, as the crowd chanted “won’t go back.”\n\n“I see one candidate who wants to protect the right to vote while the other has tried to cook up 11,000 votes in Georgia,” Sharpton said. “I see a candidate who, with Joe Biden, brought leaders to the White House to confront violent hatred, running against a man who said neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were fine people. I see a candidate who has sought to reform and uphold the law and a man who wrongly assumes his mug shot appeals to Black Americans.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMitt Romney says he's not tonight's surprise guest: 'So disappointing, I know!'\n\nMitt Romney will not be joining Democrats in Chicago.\n\n\"Contrary to fake news posts, I am not the surprise guest at the DNC tonight,\" Romney wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nRomney's was one of several names floated as a possible \"surprise guest\" appearing on the final night of the Democratic convention. The Utah senator said instead, \"My guess is that it will be Beyoncé or Taylor Swift.\"\n\n\"So disappointing, I know!\"\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nElissa Slotkin tells crowd to ‘claim your patriotism’\n\nMichigan Senate nominee Elissa Slotkin leaned into her national security background, telling the audience that “the choice in November is stark.”\n\nSlotkin, who currently serves in Congress representing Michigan’s 7th District and is a former CIA intelligence officer, said America can either retreat from the world or lead the world. “Trump wants to take us backwards. He admires dictators. A lot. He treats our friends as adversaries and our adversaries as friends.\n\nShe urged the audience to “claim your patriotism.”\n\n“For everyone here and everyone watching, I want you to proudly claim your patriotism,” she said. “You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag but spit in the face of freedoms it represents.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nRFK Jr.? Donald Trump announces 'special guest' at Friday event in Arizona\n\nThe Donald Trump campaign may be trying to build anticipation for a possible endorsement from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The campaign announced late Thursday that a \"special guest\" would join the former president at a Friday event in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nIn nearby Phoenix on Friday, Kennedy is scheduled to make an announcement about his independent campaign's future.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has said he would welcome Kennedy's support and possibly consider appointing him to some kind of position in a new administration.\n\n\"He's a little different kind of a guy, very smart guy, is a very good person,\" Trump said Thursday on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it. I would be very honored by it.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nElizabeth Warren on Donald Trump and Kamala Harris: ‘The difference between a criminal and a prosecutor’\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren attacked former President Donald Trump’s criminal record in her speech to Democratic delegates, contrasting it with Harris’ experience as a prosecutor.\n\nWarren, who ran for the presidency in 2020, teared up as she was warmly greeted by the crowd Thursday night. She praised Harris’ work as California attorney general after the 2008 housing crash.\n\n“Kamala Harris stepped up,” Warren said. “She enforced the law, she fought the giant banks and she delivered billions of dollars of help for families. And that is the difference between a criminal and a prosecutor.”\n\nWarren said Harris will work to make life more affordable for working families.\n\n“Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families,” Warren said. “He doesn’t know how. And basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers. But Kamala, she cares deep down.

They're selling you a lie. It's in the bag with the diapers. Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.”\n\nHe added that “most companies are good companies. It's the food conglomerates that sit behind the supermarkets, the faceless wholesalers, they're the ones who are extorting families at the checkout counter.”\n\n“I've been fighting to ban price gouging on food, and next year, when she's president, Kamala Harris will sign a bill to do just that,” Casey said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris shares wedding anniversary date with eldest senator\n\nVice President Harris and husband Doug Emhoff celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary Thursday, on the final night of the Democratic convention.\n\nAlso celebrating today: Sen.

He said she’s also worked to expand Pell grants, increase funding for HBCUs.\n\n“And Kamala Harris made public service loan relief a reality for teachers and first responders and firefighters and nurses and countless others across our land,” he said.\n\n“Vice President Harris delivered before and she will do it again,” he continued. “As president, she will build a brighter future.

I never met my father, but I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me,” she said.\n\n“My grandparents were there for me, and as they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. So when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with a personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents,” she added.\n\nBaldwin accused former President Donald Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare “while giving a huge new tax break to billionaires and corporations.”\n\n“They've got it backwards.

Alex Padilla said Harris will defend the American dream for families and kids. Padilla, a former California state lawmaker and secretary of state, was appointed to the Senate in 2021 after Harris was sworn in as vice president, and he won election to a full term in 2022.\n\nHe joked that when he took over Harris’ Senate seat, “I knew that I had some big Chuck Taylors to fill,” referencing the vice president's signature shoe.\n\n“My question for all of you tonight is this: This November, who’s ready to defend the dream?” he asked the audience, repeating the question in Spanish.\n\n“Tim Walz is ready to defend the dream,” Padilla continued. “Kamala Harris will defend the dream.

The 59-year-old woman has developed a knack for being at the right place at the right time to get photographed by the media as she protests former President Donald Trump and conservative policies like the Agenda 2025 plan to remake the federal government.\n\nMultiple news photographers have captured Seiler's protests across the country since at least 2019, from Chicago to Milwaukee to Miami to outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nThis isn't how she'd planned to spend her retirement savings after arriving in the United States from the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago nearly 40 years ago. But with her bright makeup and eye-catching signs, protest has become her calling. In Chicago, she's sleeping in a friend's van so she can keep costs down.\n\n\"I am crazy,\" Seiler said with a laugh. \"Nobody who is totally sane would do this.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nPop-up political protester:How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nHarris celebrates nomination + 10-year wedding anniversary\n\nKamala Harris will take the stage tonight to formally accept her party’s presidential nomination.

There was no coup, however; the party turned to Vice President Harris after Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\nTo be sure, Trump did use most of his remarks Thursday to criticize the Bush-Harris administration's record on border security. The event that lasted more than an hour also featured family members who have lost loved ones in crimes committed by people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn criticizing Harris, Trump said Harris \"will not mention the victims\" in her acceptance speech on Thursday night. During the convention, Democratic speakers said Trump is also responsible for border problems, having used his power over Republican lawmakers to block legislation that would have tightened the border.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhite House slams ‘anti-Semitic’ Donald Trump post targeting Josh Shapiro\n\nThe White House condemned a social media post from Donald Trump as “Antisemitic, dangerous and hurtful” after the former president referred to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and slammed his support for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social Wednesday night after Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, wrote that Shapiro “made a really bad and poorly delivered speech” for Harris – someone who Trump said “hates Israel and will do nothing” to help Israel survive.\n\n“Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,” Trump wrote. “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.”\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, was among the final contenders for Harris’ vice-presidential running-mate before Harris ultimately picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. White House spokesman Herbie Ziskend, in a statement, called it “Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’”\n\nZiskend added: “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kinds.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters take the spotlight during DNC. What impact will they make?\n\nIt's been no 1968.\n\nThe prospect that massive protests over the war in Gaza would dominate the Democratic National Convention and bring mayhem to the streets of Chicago both energized supporters and instilled unease in others.\n\nBut headlines out of Chicago instead have been splashed with Democratic enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Gaza protests and marches, which attracted thousands of passionate demonstrators, have been significantly smaller than organizers predicted.\n\nThere's still one night to go, with the highest stakes yet for both the anti-war movement and the Chicago authorities as Harris formally accepts her party's nomination for president.\n\n– Sophie Carson, Terry Collins, Michael Loria, Tamia Fowlkes and Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat time does the DNC start tonight?

The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies? No,” she said. “But are they scared of a leader who’s gonna go after his enemies, and reward his friends, and turn us into a banana republic? Turns out they don’t like that.”\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nKlobuchar: 'There is a lot of competition about competition'\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention last month, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s support for anti-monopoly measures set off a flurry of messaging from Democrats, as they sought to reassure voters that they, not the GOP, are the party of workers and economic progressivism.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Thursday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel. Last month, Gaza war activists released insects at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C. in an effort to disrupt the stay of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne witness staying at the Fairmont told USA TODAY the insects appeared to be crickets, while other news reports suggested maggots.

For the sake of each of us.”\n\nThe uncommitted movement has for months pushed Democratic leaders to implement an arms embargo to Israel and work toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

The vice president would have it no other way.\n\n“Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” “There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”\n\nGopalan, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009 at age 70 of colon cancer, won't see her daughter accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday, but she will be a strong presence.\n\nGopalan set out on her own across the world at the age of 19, defying her native culture. She raised two girls to identify both with her own background and one that was totally alien to her. She encouraged them to excel and exceed expectations but not leave others behind.

She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F.

The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has caused some younger Jewish Americans to push back at Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll in March found that 42% of American Jews between the ages of 18 years old and 34 believe the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas is \"unacceptable.\" Only 27% of Jewish Americans ages 50 to 64 years old said it is \"unacceptable.\"\n\nRead more on the divisions facing some Democrats.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin\n\nGus Walz in Wednesday night's most touching moment: 'I love you, dad.'\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view:Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

Still showcasing the 42nd president could also backfire and aggravate younger generations of Democrats, who find it hard reconcile with Clinton's tenure scarred by an extramarital affair with an intern.

Biden and his team could tell from the monitor how many missiles were in the air. What they could not know right away was how many, if any, were striking their target.\n\nTension built inside the Situation Room as Biden and his aides waited for an update. At one point, the president got up from his leather chair at the head of the conference table and paced nervously around the room.\n\nThe conflict threatening to inflame the Middle East that afternoon wasn’t the only emerging crisis on Biden’s mind. Earlier that day, Oct. 1, tens of thousands of U.S. dockworkers had walked off the job, closing ports along the East and Gulf coasts and shutting down ocean shipping from Maine to Texas.\n\nThe labor dispute threatened to leave shelves empty, raise prices and potentially disrupt recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene, which just six days earlier had devastated parts of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Making matters worse, in a few days another powerful storm would develop in the western Caribbean and hurl toward Florida’s West Coast.\n\nManaging the response to three unfolding events would be a test for Biden, who had five decades of experience in government but just a little more than three months left in office. Biden had reluctantly ended his bid for re-election in late July amid questions about whether he could win a second term.\n\nBiden’s shaky performance during a presidential debate with his nemesis, Donald Trump, had raised doubts about whether he was up to the rigors of the presidency. But behind the scenes, aides described him as fully engaged as he deals with the job's daily pressures and unforeseen challenges, even as Trump won a convincing victory over Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday.\n\n'A bitter pill':Biden has changed course over his 50-year career. None of that compares to his 2024 choice.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden departs for Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, followed by Brazil, where he will attend and meet for the final time as president with leaders of the Group of 20, or G20, nations. Hanging over the global gatherings will be the uncertainty surrounding Biden’s departure from office in January and Trump’s stunning return to the presidency.\n\nWith time running short, Biden still has an extensive to-do list before walking out of the Oval Office for the final time as president.\n\n“We feel time is slipping through the hourglass, and we want to complete so much of what we’ve started,” said Liz Sherwood-Randall, who serves as Biden’s homeland security adviser and has worked for him off and on for the past four decades.\n\nBut unexpected events – at home and across the world – often intrude on a president’s plans. Which is why, for several days in late September and October, Biden toggled between a cascade of converging crises that posed an end-game challenge to his one-term presidency.\n\nA 'productive' final act\n\nSix months earlier, Jeff Zients was in his office in the West Wing when he got the call. It was Sunday afternoon, July 21.\n\nBiden, phoning from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, wanted his chief of staff to know he was ending his campaign for a second term. A disastrous debate with Trump had brought calls from Democratic leaders for Biden to step aside and allow Harris to become the party’s nominee. Biden instructed Zients to tell the senior White House team that he had decided to heed those calls.\n\nBiden then steered the conversation to his remaining time in office. “I want to have a six-month period of time that's as or more productive than any other six-month period of time since I've been in office,” Zients recalled him saying.\n\nWhite House aides map out Biden’s schedule in 100-day increments. Biden said he understood that a plan was already in place for the next 100 days. But he wanted a new plan, and he wanted it ASAP. Biden sketched out for his chief of staff the things he wanted to emphasize during what was left of his time in office.\n\n“We talked a lot about lowering costs,” Zients said. “We’ve made a lot of progress, but there are too many areas where costs are still too high. What more can we do on junk fees? What more can we do on housing? What more can we do on food?”\n\nBiden’s team quickly assembled another plan for his final months in office.\n\nThen the first disaster hit.\n\nHurricane Helene and a 'president for all Americans'\n\nHurricane Helene slammed into Florida on Sept. 26 with a catastrophic vengeance and then cut a path of destruction across the southeastern United States from Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas before reaching as far north as Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nAt least 227 people were killed. Entire towns were swallowed by flooding. Hundreds of roads were washed out and bridges damaged. Residents in isolated communities were stranded with no power or phone service. Thousands had no drinkable water. Damage from the hurricane, one of the deadliest to make landfall in the United States, is projected to surpass $30 billion.\n\nBiden had dealt with major flooding in California, a devastating tornado in Kentucky and multiple other natural disasters during his presidency, but Helene was harder in some aspects because many of the affected areas were remote and the victims were difficult to reach because of impassable roads and disrupted communications systems.\n\nBiden mobilized the federal government’s resources. Some 1,500 active-duty troops from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and Fort Liberty, North Carolina, delivered food, water, medicine and other supplies and helped clear roads and remove debris.\n\nAll told, 4,800 personnel from across the federal workforce were deployed to assist state-led response efforts. Biden’s instructions: Reach those people who may not be able to reach out for help. Find out what they need. Make sure they get it. Cut through red tape.\n\nBiden had demonstrated his approach to disaster relief early in his presidency. Just weeks after he took office, a powerful winter storm pummeled Texas with snow and ice, overpowering the state’s power grid and causing widespread blackouts.\n\n“In that moment, the president talked with me directly about how he thought about the importance of demonstrating so early in his presidency that he was the president for all Americans,” Sherwood-Randall said.\n\nEmergency response efforts under his administration “would not be about where there were red states or blue states,” she said, “but where there were Americans who needed help that the federal government could provide.”\n\nLives lost:Visualizing the death and destruction of Israel's war in Gaza\n\nSince then, “in every single disaster, there's a certain pattern we now follow,” she said, “because I know how intensely interested he is in knowing whether we are cutting through bureaucratic red tape and getting out to help the people who need it the most.”\n\nIt was an approach that would be tested again in just a matter of days.\n\n'Very well prepared' for Iran strike on Israel\n\nThe time it takes a missile to reach Israel after it is fired from Iran is a period of angst and uncertainty for those watching the attack unfold.\n\nAnd so it was for Biden and members of his team as they waited nervously on Oct. 1 to see how many, if any, of the nearly 200 ballistic missiles heading to Israel from Iran had hit their target.\n\nInside the Situation Room, “there are some very, very tense periods of silence as it’s unfolding,” said Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East.\n\nFor some, thoughts turned to colleagues in Israel, American citizens living there, and all of the other civilians potentially in harm’s way, McGurk recalled.\n\nConflict in Middle East:Israel completes retaliatory military strikes in Iran; US says it wasn't involved\n\nBiden would spend more than three hours in the Situation Room that day monitoring the events. Harris and other members of his team were by his side. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dialed into the meeting. Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, who heads the U.S. Central Command, sent regular updates on the number of missiles in the air.\n\nSeveral times that day, Biden would be pulled from the room by his aides to deal with other crises unfolding at home.\n\nThe federal government was still working with the states hit by Hurricane Helene. Dockworkers, still in a contract dispute with shipping company executives, had gone on strike earlier that morning, potentially slowing the hurricane recovery. Biden had instructed his staff to get the two sides to come to an agreement as soon as possible.\n\nBiden’s half a century of government experience and leadership positions equipped him with the ability to segue smoothly from one crisis to another, Zients said. “It really matters and was very evident during this period of time,” he said.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war:One year after Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, how far could Gaza war expand?\n\nIn the Middle East, tensions had been building for months between Israel and Iran.\n\nIn April, Iran had fired 300 missiles and drones into Israel as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waged war in the Gaza Strip against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which had attacked the Jewish state on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas had killed 1,200 people in the attack and taken more than 200 others hostage. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing war, according to the Gaza health ministry, and U.S.-led efforts to reach a cease-fire would come up short.\n\nHostilities escalated further when Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, in an airstrike in Beirut last month. Iran struck back with waves of missiles.\n\nBiden had anticipated this moment. He had directed the U.S. military to help Israel shoot down the Iranian rockets. Biden knew the number of ships and interceptors available “because we have been doing this for a long time,” McGurk said. “We were very well prepared for this.”\n\nIsrael, with the help of the U.S., would shoot down most of the Iranian missiles before they ever reached their target. Confident the barrage had failed, Biden pressed his staff to find out if Israel intended to respond to the Iranian attack – and, if so, how.\n\n'Get a deal done'\n\nTwo days later, on Oct. 3, Zients initiated a Zoom call with global shipping company executives. It was 5:30 a.m. The sun had yet to rise over Washington, but Zients wanted to send a message about the urgency of settling the strike by 45,000 dockworkers, which was entering its third day and threatened to impede hurricane relief.\n\nBiden understood how crippling the strike could be to the economy. Just nine months into his presidency, a breakdown in the nation’s system for transporting goods had caused cargo to pile up at ports on the West Coast. Consumer demand surged as Americans emerged from months of COVID lockdowns. Supply chains broke down as factories, ports and freight yards struggled to keep pace with growing demand.\n\nBiden was determined not to let that happen again, said Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. At the same time, he felt that dockworkers, who were demanding a raise, had been asked to sacrifice time and again and deserved a fair share of the record profits that transport carriers were reaping.\n\nBiden, who often boasts of being the most pro-union president in history, wanted to reassure the leader of the International Longshoremen's Association, Harold Daggett, that he supported the workers’ desire for a strong contract. But he also wanted to engage with the shipping company executives to drive home the urgency of the situation and make it clear to them that allowing the strike to drag on was unacceptable.\n\nSo Zients arranged the predawn Zoom meeting with members of the U.S. Maritime Alliance. With him on the call were Brainard, Labor Secretary Julie Su and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The shipping companies had moved closer to some of the dockworkers’ demands. But it wasn’t enough. Zients bluntly gave them a directive: Reopen negotiations and settle the strike. Now.\n\n“We were basically saying, you tell us you are committed to the American market, you tell us you're patriotic,” Brainard recalled. “It is vital to get to a resolution now. Because you are going to impede hurricane recovery efforts if we don't get the ports back open.”\n\nStrike:US port workers and operators reach deal to end East Coast strike immediately, union says\n\nLater that day, Biden pulled Brainard aside in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room as he was about to board Marine One for a trip to Florida and Georgia to survey the hurricane damage.\n\n“We really need to get a deal done today,” he said. “It’s time.”\n\nBefore the end of the day, an agreement was in place. Dockworkers would get a 62% wage increase over six years – the union had sought 77% – and ports would reopen until January 2025, allowing negotiations to continue on other unresolved issues.\n\nOne crisis was over. Another was about to begin.\n\n'A matter of life and death'\n\nThe president was worried.\n\nA tropical storm, this one potentially even more powerful than Helene, was developing in the western Caribbean and, if projections were accurate, heading toward Florida. Many communities still recovering from the destruction wrought by Helene would be in the path of the new storm, known as Milton.\n\nIn a briefing with Sherwood-Randall on Sunday, Oct. 6, Biden raised concerns that scrap left behind by Helene, when tossed about in hurricane-force winds, could become dangerous projectiles.\n\nStart removing as much debris as possible, he ordered. Mobilize resources and personnel, he instructed, including search and rescue crews, management teams and other federal workers, without detracting from the ongoing response to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.\n\nThe next day, Sherwood-Randall gave Biden another update in the private dining room just off the Oval Office. Afterward, Biden called the National Weather Service to learn the latest on the storm’s size, where it was tracking and its expected impact. He then phoned Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to relay the most up-to-date storm information and to see if they had the resources to deal with any damage.\n\n“We were bracing for something that could be on a scale that was absolutely unprecedented,” Sherwood-Randall said. “That's what the weather experts were telling us. It's what the National Hurricane Center was projecting. It's what the National Weather Service was projecting.”\n\nAssessing damage:Disastrous hurricane season costs soar past $100 billion in US, estimates say\n\nThe next morning, Oct. 8, Biden announced he was postponing a trip to Germany and Angola to stay in Washington and monitor the storm. In a meeting with his cabinet secretaries and senior officials, he warned that Milton, gathering strength, could be the worst storm to hit Florida in a century. Floridians under an evacuation order should leave “now, now, now,” he advised.\n\n“It’s a matter of life and death,” he said.\n\nMembers of his staff went on local TV news outlets and radio and turned to digital platforms and other media to spread the same message.\n\n“I think that was clearly lifesaving,” Sherwood-Randall said. “What happened as a result, at the direction of the president, was we used every possible messaging platform, including his voice, to tell people to follow the mandatory evacuation orders and to go into shelters, not just wait out the storm. It was, as we would say in our generation, like hearing things in stereo. Every possible way you could hear it, you were hearing it.”\n\nHow to protect yourself:Beware of flood-damaged vehicles being sold across US.\n\nLater that night, just before 10 p.m., as the storm was starting to make landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, Biden called Sherwood-Randall at home with a list of detailed questions. “He wanted to know the size of the eye of the storm,” she recalled. “And he wanted to know how far the bands extend on either side of the eye because those bands will indicate how broad the effects of the storm will be.”\n\nMilton would kill at least 17 people, spawn tornadoes and cause severe flooding, but its impact wasn't as destructive as forecast. Biden and his team had prepared for the worst but were relieved it hadn’t happened.\n\n“He always says he’d rather be criticized for being too prepared than under-prepared,” Zients said.\n\nTaking advantage of every day left\n\nA Marine Guard opened the door to the Oval Office, and Biden stepped out into the autumn morning air. Scattered clouds hung over the Rose Garden as Biden, removing his trademark aviator sunglasses, approached the podium adorned with the presidential seal.\n\n“For over 200 years, America has carried on the greatest experiment in self-government in the history of the world,” he began.\n\nTwo days earlier, Trump had won a resounding victory over Harris. The man whom Biden defeated just four years ago, and whom he repeatedly described as a threat to democracy, will return to the White House next year as his successor. In his remarks Thursday morning, Biden wanted to reassure Americans that he respected their decision and let them know that his administration would see to a peaceful transfer of power in January.\n\n“It’s been a historic presidency,” he said, summing up his four years in office, “not because I’m president – because what we’ve done, what you’ve done. A presidency for all Americans.”\n\nBiden is now in the final stretch of his presidency. Others may be starting to think about his legacy. But not him.\n\n“It’s not a terrain he wants to spend time on,” Zients said.\n\nEven so, Biden is keenly aware that his time in the White House is running out. His focus for now is getting as much done as possible in the time he has left, Zients said.\n\n“He thinks that we’ve got to spend every minute we have getting stuff done, and when we do that, we will impact people’s lives and make the world a better place,” Zients said.\n\n“Right now,” he said, “is the time to take advantage of every single day.”\n\nEven if, in his final days in office, another crisis comes along.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard on the video. Debris is heard raining down on the building and the street is obscured by a dust cloud. A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike.\n\nAs the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground.\n\n“Medic,” someone is heard repeatedly screaming.\n\nPhotographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video.\n\nThe Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\n“Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,” it said.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely “considerably higher.” CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24.\n\nEvacuation corridors closed\n\nIn the country’s southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed – after a first effort failed on Saturday – were dashed within hours.\n\nThe governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned “evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions.”\n\nKyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, “has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way.”\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday’s planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed.\n\n“Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts – if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,” the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\n“People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid.”\n\nUkrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures.\n\n“Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it’s still often below 0°C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,” Sovsun said on Twitter.\n\nSeparately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration.\n\nIn a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said “repeated shelling” of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities.\n\nRussia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest.\n\n“They (Russian troops) captured Hostomel and Bucha yesterday (Saturday). The Russians entered there,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in the Ukrainian President’s Office, referring to two suburbs northwest of Kyiv. “They have injured many children and do not allow to evacuate them, despite numerous appeals at the highest state level to provide a ‘green corridor’ from Bucha and Irpin. There are many children in the basements.”\n\nArestovych described the situation as a “catastrophe,” adding that discussions were going on “at the highest level with international humanitarian institutions, through mediators with the Russians” in order to find a way out for those who are trapped.\n\nSeveral children have died, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Health.\n\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Sunday that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and said the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike.\n\nIn an address broadcast on Facebook, Zelensky said: “Russian people always used to come to Odessa and they only knew warmth and generosity and what’s now? Artillery, bombs against Odessa. This will be a war crime. This will be (a) historic crime.”\n\nIn a separate message, Zelensky again appealed for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, following the destruction of Vynnytsia’s airport.\n\n“They continue to ruin our infrastructure our life, which we have built, and our parents, and grandparents, many generations of Ukrainians. We repeat every day – close the skies over Ukraine,” he added.\n\nUS and European officials have been discussing how the West would support a government in exile helmed by Zelensky should he have to flee Kyiv, Western officials told CNN.\n\nThe discussions have ranged from supporting Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in a potential move to Lviv in western Ukraine, to the possibility that Zelensky and his aides are forced to flee Ukraine altogether and establish a new government in Poland, the officials said.\n\nWestern officials have been wary of discussing a government in exile directly with Zelensky because he wants to stay in Kyiv and has so far rejected conversations that focus on anything other than boosting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, two Western diplomats said.\n\nCalls for more support\n\nAs the Russian invasion continues, Zelensky has reiterated his pleas for US and NATO assistance in establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine – a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against the country.\n\nBut there are fears such a move could be seen as an escalation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin warning on Saturday he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as “participants in a military conflict.”\n\nZelensky has repeatedly asked NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but both say they oppose such a move.\n\nIn an impassioned call to US lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky also encouraged Eastern European nations to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, stressing they were needed to defend against Russian aggression.\n\nOn the call, Zelensky said if the West won’t impose a no-fly zone they should give Ukraine planes.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed the United States is working with Poland on the possibility of Warsaw providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Some Biden administration officials privately fear that this move could be viewed by the Russians as an escalation, US officials say.\n\nMeanwhile, a multinational effort to send weapons to Ukraine is running at top speed at an undisclosed airfield in Eastern Europe, a defense official said. The US European Command is at the heart of the operation, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley met last week with troops and personnel to examine the weapons shipments activity, the official said.\n\nSince the invasion, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, a senior US defense official said Friday, some of which had rarely sent such substantial equipment before.\n\nPutin claimed Saturday that Russia had almost completed the destruction of Ukrainian air defense systems, and added that Western sanctions were the “equivalent of a declaration of war.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has seen “very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians” in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime.\n\nHe added that the US is working with its allies in Europe to look into the possibility of banning Russian oil imports in an effort to further punish the country for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Josh Pennington Luke Mcgee Radina Gigova", "Tim Lister", "Josh Pennington", "Luke Mcgee", "Radina Gigova"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/20/live-biden-inauguration-updates-joe-biden-become-46th-president/4214160001/", "title": "Live updates: Biden's inauguration day ends with a wave and a ...", "text": "USA Today is covering the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris live. Refresh often for updates.\n\nAfter three campaigns for president, the day Biden finally became president ended with a bang.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his inauguration day watching a massive firework show above the National Mall with his family from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House.\n\nSinger Katy Perry performed her song “Firework” as the first family looked on, the stunning display lighting up the Washington Monument.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, watched from the Lincoln Memorial, where she earlier had spoken.\n\nThe show was the finale to the \"Celebrating America\" primetime special that replaced the usual inaugural balls, which were scrapped this year due to COVID-19 concerns.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nBiden: 'I will give my all to you'\n\nIn a coda to his inauguration speech, President Joe Biden made one more plea for the nation to come together during an appearance Wednesday night at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n“This is a great nation. We're good people,” Biden said during the “Celebrating America” program that was the final event of a day of inaugural activities. “To overcome the challenges in front of us requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity.”\n\nCalling the pandemic and the economic, racial justice and climate crises threats to the democracy, Biden cast the current moment among past chapters in history that divided the nation. Behind him was the statue of President Abraham Lincoln, who tried to keep the nation from being torn apart over the Civil War. Not far away on the National Mall was the memorial to Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nBiden said the question is whether the nation can “meet the moment like our forebears had.”\n\n“I believe we must, and I believe we will,” Biden said, before delivering a final promise: “I will give my all to you.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden won’t address re-election plans until later\n\nHours after Biden became the oldest person to be sworn in as president, spokeswoman Jen Psaki was not specific about whether Biden plans to run for re-election.\n\nPsaki said Biden, 78, will wait until “sometime into his first term to speak more about his political plans moving forward.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump filed paperwork to run for re-election on his first day.\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons, a friend of Biden’s, recently told Politico that Biden “is planning to run again.”\n\nPsaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden’s focus is “not on politics.”\n\n“It is on getting to work and solving the problems of the American people,” she said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden 'felt like he was coming home'\n\nPress Secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had an \"incredible sense of calm\" as he entered the Oval Office for the first time as commander-in-chief on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"He felt like he was coming home,\" Psaki said of Biden, who spent eight years at the White House under Barack Obama's administration. \"That was an emotion that overtook him today.\"\n\nPsaki said that Biden also expressed a \"sense of joy\" as he spent the day with his family and grandchildren as he settled into his White House residence.\n\nThe president is also \"eager to get to work,\" she added, noting that he was already quizzing aides about policy, COVID-19 plans and \"what's next.\"\n\nBiden signed 15 executive orders and two directives in the hours after he was sworn in, unwinding his predecessor's policies on immigration and environmental regulations as well as a mask mandate on federal properties.\n\nPsaki said the administration consulted the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel on all executive actions in advance of Biden's signing of them following his inauguration.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden spokeswoman says no pending call between Biden, Trump planned\n\nThere is no call between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump planned immediately, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.\n\nPsaki said the letter Trump left for Biden was private, but it was “both generous and gracious.”\n\n“I wouldn't take it as an indication of a pending call with the former president,” she said.\n\nBiden said earlier Wednesday that Trump “wrote a very generous letter,” but did not share the contents of the letter, saying it was “private” and he would “not talk about it until I talk to him, but it was generous.”\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden to bring back regular COVID-19 briefings\n\nThe Biden administration plans to back bring back regular briefings by health officials to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, marking a return of something Trump months ago abandoned.\n\n“What we plan to do is not just return these daily briefings, Monday through Friday,” said Biden press secretary Jen Psaki, holding her first daily press conference, “but also to return briefings with our health officials.”\n\nPsaki was answering how the Biden administration plans to combat disinformation about COVID-19.\n\n“There are a number of ways to combat misinformation. One of them is accurate information, and truth and data, and sharing information even when it is hard to hear.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to call Canadian prime minister\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s first call to a foreign leader will be to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Biden plans to call Trudeau on Friday. The two leaders will discuss the “important relationship” between the two countries and will likely talk about Biden’s decision revoke a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, Psaki said.\n\nBiden’s cancellation of the pipeline permit rescinds Donald Trump's approval of a project long criticized by environmentalists.\n\nTrudeau said he was disappointed by Biden’s action but that he recognized the new president was fulfilling a campaign promise.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden spokeswoman promises 'truth and transparency'\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s press secretary began her first briefing on Thursday with a pledge of openness.\n\nSpokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden asked her to “bring truth and transparency back to the briefing room.”\n\n“Rebuilding trust with the American people will be central to our focus in the press office and in the White House every single day,” she said from the lectern in the White House briefing room.\n\nThat doesn’t mean administration officials and the media will share the same views, she said. But, she said, they have the common goal of “sharing accurate information” with the public.\n\nAsked in the first question whether her primary role is promoting Biden’s interest or providing the unvarnished truth, Psaki said the administration is committed to sharing the truth, even when it’s hard to hear.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nSpy chief nominee Avril Haines clears Senate\n\nAvril Haines was approved as the nation's intelligence chief by the Senate Wednesday evening, the first of President Joe Biden’s nominees to clear the chamber.\n\nIn her post as director of national intelligence, Haines will oversee 18 U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies – from the CIA and the FBI to nine units under the Pentagon's purview, including the newly added Space Force.\n\nAs DNI, she will also be Biden's principal intelligence adviser as the country reckons with the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and faces a slew of foreign threats.\n\nHaines cleared the chamber after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton withdrew his hold on her nomination over questions he still had after her Tuesday confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Democrats have highlighted the need to quickly confirm Biden’s picks as a top priority, specifically the president’s nominees that deal with the nation’s security and intelligence.\n\nFor hours Tuesday, Haines was peppered with questions from senators about QAnon conspiracies and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. She vowed to remain at \"arms length\" from her boss if confirmed to the post. She said her mandate from Biden would be to deliver \"unvarnished\" threat assessments, even if it contradicts his policy preferences.\n\n— Christal Hayes and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden to political appointees: 'You work for the people'\n\nPresident Joe Biden swore in hundreds of political appointees Wednesday in a virtual ceremony in which he also issued a stern warning: Expect long hours. And always be respectful.\n\n“You work for the people. I work for the people,” Biden said from the White House State Dining Room, where he administered the oath of office to appointees to various political posts during a videoconference call.\n\nBiden thanked employees for working for him. “You’re going to work like the devil,” he said. “We all do. We all work long hours.”\n\nBiden stressed that the nation has an opportunity to eliminate systemic racism in part because of the death of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who died last May at the hands of police. Floyd’s death touched off nationwide protests for racial justice.\n\nBiden said he expects people who work for him to treat everyone with dignity and respect. If they don’t, “I will fire you on the spot,” he said.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden administration will reverse military rules on transgender troops\n\nThe Biden administration intends within days to reverse the Pentagon policy former President Donald Trump ordered that limits the service and treatment of transgender troops, according to an official with Biden’s transition team.\n\nBiden’s nominee for the Defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at his Senate hearing on Tuesday that he supports reversing the policy. The policy will be rescinded after Biden’s leadership team is in place at the Pentagon, said the official who is not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTrump announced a ban on service by transgender troops by tweet in 2017, a move that caught military officials by surprise. The policy took months to develop and continues to be challenged in the courts. It effectively bans transgender people from joining the military and limits treatment for transgender troops.\n\nMajor medical and psychological associations say there is no scientific reason for banning transgender troops from serving. The Pentagon estimates there are about 10,000 transgender troops. The annual bill for those who require treatment accounts for about $3 million of the Pentagon’s $50 billion health care budget.\n\n— Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden to put pending federal rules on hold\n\nPresident Joe Biden is putting pending federal regulations on hold until his new administration gets a chance to review them.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Ron Klain issued a memo Wednesday to department heads and agencies advising them that pending federal regulations should be put on hold until they are reviewed. Any proposed rules that have been sent to the Federal Register but not yet published are to be withdrawn until they are approved and reviewed.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in December that the freeze would stop so-called “midnight” regulations. One pending rule she cited is a proposal by Donald Trump’s Labor Department that would make it easier for companies to treat employees as independent contractors. Critics argued the change could impact workers because many independent contractors don’t receive overtime pay or health benefits.\n\nThe move is also part of Biden’s plan to unwind his predecessor's policies. In his first hours as president, Biden is expected to sign 15 executive orders, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and reversing travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nKlain’s memo advises postponing for 60 days the starting date of any new rules that have been published but not yet taken effect so that they can be further reviewed.\n\n— Michael Collins and Courtney Subramanian\n\nDemocrats officially control Senate, House and White House for first time in a decade\n\nThe swearing-in of two new Georgia Democrats in the Senate marks the first time the party will control the White House and both chambers of Congress in a decade.\n\nGeorgia’s Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff were sworn into office by Vice President Kamala Harris, one of her first official duties in the role.\n\nThe two new Democrats will give the chamber a 50-50 split, which effectively would give Democrats the majority because Harris – as President of the Senate – would be the tie-breaking vote.\n\nHarris, who resigned the Senate this week ahead of her inauguration, also swore in her replacement: Democrat Alex Padilla.\n\nThe power shift marks the first time Democrats have controlled the upper chamber since 2014 and the first time in a decade that Democrats will control the House, Senate and White House. The last time was in 2011 under former President Barack Obama.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nGeorge W. Bush lauds Rep. Jim Clyburn as 'savior' after pivotal SC primary endorsement led to Biden election\n\nThe highest-ranking Black member of Congress says former President George W. Bush lauded his role as a “savior” in helping get President Joe Biden elected to the White House.\n\nU.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said Wednesday on a call with reporters that the Republican former president told him ahead of the inaugural ceremony that, if he had not given Biden the boost he did ahead of South Carolina’s primary, “we would not be having this transfer of power today.”\n\nClyburn says Bush went on to say that Biden was “the only one who could have defeated the incumbent president,” Donald Trump. Trump and the Bush family didn’t get along.\n\nClyburn’s pivotal endorsement ahead of South Carolina’s Democratic primary helped propel Biden to the nomination. Biden won South Carolina by a margin of nearly 30 points.\n\nClyburn, South Carolina’s only Democratic representative in Congress, is the dean of the state’s Democrats and the third-ranking member of the U.S. House.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nBiden administration releases names of acting agency heads\n\nHours after President Joe Biden was sworn into office, White House officials released the names of the administration's acting agency heads as the president's nominees await Senate confirmation.\n\nThe move allows Biden to install members of his own team rather than rely on any of former President Donald Trump's political appointees left within the federal government beyond Jan. 20.\n\nBiden's political appointees have faced severe delays in the weeks between the president's election victory and the inauguration. Trump had his defense and homeland secretaries confirmed when he took office while former President Barack Obama had six of his nominees in place by the time he was sworn in.\n\nThe Senate began confirmation hearings just before inauguration for five of Biden's Cabinet picks, including Janet Yellen, nominee for Treasury Secretary, Tony Blinken, nominee for secretary of state, Avril Haines, nominee for director of national intelligence, Lloyd Austin, nominee for Defense secretary and Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee for Homeland Security secretary.\n\nThe list confirmed an earlier report by USA TODAY that Biden planned to tap career Justice official Monty Wilkinson to serve as acting attorney general.\n\nAmong those named, nearly all of whom are career civil servants, are:\n\nDavid Norquist, Department of Defense\n\nDavid Cohen, Central Intelligence Agency\n\nDan Smith, Department of State\n\nNorris Cochran, Department of Health and Human Services\n\nDavid Pekoske, Department of Homeland Security\n\nDavid Huizenga, Department of Energy\n\nMonty Wilkinson, Department of Justice\n\nAl Stewart, Department of Labor\n\nAndy Baukol, Department of Treasury\n\nLora Shiao, Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\nMaria Pagan, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative\n\nRob Fairweather, Office of Management and Budget\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden arrives at the White House for the first time as president\n\nPresident Joe Biden was escorted to the White House for the first time Wednesday afternoon, arriving without the thousands of spectators that historically line the streets for a traditional Inauguration Day parade.\n\nBiden held the hand of his wife Jill Biden as he walked one block from 15th Street to the White House. The couple waved at the small crowd that was in attendance. Biden ran over to greet television personality Al Roker at one point.\n\n“It feels great. It feels good,” Biden said.\n\nAnother reporter asked whether he has a message for former President Donald Trump. Biden did not respond.\n\nWhen they got to the White House door, the Bidens embraced each other as a military band played \"Hail to the Chief.\" They then entered with their family and others.\n\nBecause of health precautions during the coronavirus pandemic, a virtual “Parade Across America” replaced the traditional inauguration parade. The virtual event kicked off as Biden arrived at the White House.\n\nTrailing the Bidens in the escort was music from the marching band of the University of Delaware, Biden’s alma mater, and Howard University, where Vice President Harris graduated.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPence: 'There’s no place like home'\n\nIn his first public remarks since leaving office, former Vice President Mike Pence congratulated the new occupants of the Oval Office before thanking Donald Trump “for making America great again.”\n\n\"Thank you, President Trump, for all you’ve done for this country,\" an emotional Pence said as a spoke to supporters in his hometown of Columbus, Ind., Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPence also thanked Trump for the privilege of serving as his vice president, a task that became especially challenging in the final days when Trump unsuccessfully pressured him to try to block Congress from accepting the electoral votes.\n\nPence acknowledged all those who have lost their lives from COVID-19, saying “our hearts will always be with families that have lost loved ones in this global pandemic over the ordeal of this past year.”\n\nBut Pence, who headed the administration’s coronavirus task force, said that he will always be proud of the administration’s response to the pandemic. Those actions, he said, have brought the nation to “the beginning of the end.”\n\nPence repeatedly fought back tears as he thanked friends, family and staff. Several of his aides flew back with him to Indiana, taking the same plane that took the Pences to Washington four years ago.\n\nPence announced that he will soon be resettling in his home state, where he served as governor and as a member of Congress after a career as a radio talk show host.\n\n“While we just come back to Indiana today, I've already promised Karen we’ll be moving back to Indiana come this summer,” Pence said of his wife. “There's no place like home.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nJoe Biden: New answer to a Super Bowl trivia question\n\nJoe Biden’s ascension to the presidency expands the answer to a great football trivia question: How many colleges have produced both U.S. presidents and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks?\n\nThe answer is now five, thanks to Biden’s alma mater, the University of Delaware; the Blue Hens also produced quarterback Joe Flacco, who led the Baltimore Ravens to a Super Bowl win over San Francisco in 2013.\n\nOther schools that have produced presidents and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks:\n\nUniversity of Michigan (Gerald Ford and Tom Brady):\n\nThe United States Naval Academy (Jimmy Carter and Roger Staubach);\n\nStanford (Herbert Hoover, Jim Plunkett, and John Elway);\n\nMiami of Ohio (Benjamin Harrison and Ben Roethlisberger).\n\n— David Jackson\n\nBiden, joined by former presidents, honors the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nJoined by three of his predecessors, newly sworn-in President Joe Biden led a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in his first trip as commander in chief.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris saluted the tomb around 2:45 p.m. ET Wednesday as a solider performed “Taps,” the traditional call played at military funerals and flag ceremonies, on the bugle.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, along with their spouses, joined Biden and Harris for the ceremony. Donald Trump, who left Washington for Florida before the inauguration, was not present.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden, Harris enjoy levity with congressional leaders\n\nA traditional gift-giving ceremony reflected the joshing ease that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris enjoy with leaders of the House and Senate – a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., began his comments by mentioning each participant by title: “Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Dr. Biden, Mr. President.” But Biden interrupted, inviting him to be more casual.\n\n“No, Joe, you’re Mr. President,” Hoyer replied.\n\nThen first lady Jill Biden interjected.\n\n“Dr. Biden, he makes you call him Mr. President?” Hoyer asked. “Marriage is about to get rocky, I can tell.”\n\nHoyer joined House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in presenting framed photographs of the inauguration ceremony to Biden and Harris less than two hours afterward.\n\n“That was quick,” Biden said, as he walked up to the easel.\n\n“Modern technology, right?” McCarthy said. “It’s a good picture, too.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fierce Republican partisan from Kentucky, presented the Democrat Harris with a U.S. flag that flew atop the Capitol during the inauguration ceremony. But McConnell couldn’t let the moment pass without noting that both she and Biden had served in the Senate without serving in the House.\n\n“With all due respect to our distinguished speaker and our colleagues from the House, I have to note not only did we just swore in a son and daughter of the Senate to these offices, but indeed both of these former senators skipped the House altogether,” McConnell said to chuckles.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., presented two custom made, Lenox crystal vases. One of the White House was for Biden and one of the Capitol was for Harris. But she noted they are heavy, weighing 32 pounds each.\n\n“Jill, I know, is very strong and could pick them both,” Klobuchar said.\n\nThe gift-giving usually occurs during a luncheon that was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., opened the session by saying he had little time to choose a painting that traditionally provides a poignant image for the event.\n\nBut he had little time to choose a painting, so Jill Biden recommended one from Robert Seldon Duncanson, a Black painter. The landscape completed in 1859 featured a rainbow on the right side\n\n“The rainbow is always a good sign,” Blunt said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden signs inaugural proclamation, nomination documents\n\nStill at the Capitol after being sworn into office, Biden signed the inaugural proclamation around 1:25 p.m. ET, formalizing him as the 46th president, as well as documents to officially make his Cabinet nominations.\n\nThe signings are part of the procedural actions all presidents take after assuming office.\n\nNext Biden and Harris will review the readiness of military troops from the east front of the Capitol.\n\nBiden and Harris will then travel to Arlington National Cemetery where they will join former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden ends 21-minute inaugural address: ‘Thank you, America’\n\nBiden’s inaugural address clocked in at 21 minutes and ended with a call for Americans to meet the nation’s challenges with “purpose and resolve” as he thanked the country.\n\n\"With purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our times, sustained by faith, driven by conviction,” Biden said. \"My God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.\"\n\nThe speech may have seemed short, but it’s in line with the length of recent inaugural addresses.\n\nTrump’s 2017 inaugural speech was 15 minutes. Like Biden, Barack Obama spoke for 21 minutes in his 2009 inaugural address and 18 minutes in 2013. George W. Bush spoke for 15 minutes in 2001. And Bill Clinton’s inaugural addressed clocked in at 22 minutes in 1997 and just 14 minutes in 1993.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nSocial media accounts change over to Biden administration\n\nAs President Joe Biden was giving his inaugural address, accounts on various social media sites officially changed from the Trump administration over to the Biden administration - marking the end of the 45th presidency and the start of the 46th.\n\nOn Twitter, @Transition46 now owns the White House account.\n\nTwitter transferred @POTUS from former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden.\n\n@SenKamalaHarris has become @VP, and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden is under @FLOTUS.\n\nAlso, a new account @SecondGentleman has been created for Doug Emhoff, the country’s first-ever Second Gentleman.\n\nBefore Trump's personal account was permanently banned from Twitter Jan. 8, the @POTUS account was filled with retweets of the personal account. In his final days in office, Trump couldn't use the official account either after he attempted to use the @POTUS account, which Twitter said was an attempt to evade a suspension and violated its rules.\n\nThe Trump administration’s @POTUS account publicly archive is @POTUS45 and Obama's account was archived as @POTUS44.\n\nAdditionally, on Instagram, Biden now owns the @POTUS account.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann, Kelly Tyko\n\nBiden writes American story of ‘hope not fear’\n\nBiden borrowed a theme from his Democratic convention speech during the summer about choosing light over darkness in the pursuit of the public good.\n\n“We shall write an American story of hope not fear, of unity not division, of light not darkness, a story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness,” Biden said.\n\n“May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment, democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch, but thrived,” Biden said.\n\n“That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world,” Biden That is what we owe our forebears and generations to follow.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nThe ‘world is watching’\n\nTo the international audience, Biden said he knows that the world is watching.\n\nHis message to those outside the nation’s borders, he said, is: “America has been tested and we’re stronger for it.”\n\nBiden promised to repair alliances with other countries and to “engage with the world once again.”\n\nAnd, as he’s said before, Biden repeated that America shouldn’t lead by the example of the nation’s power, but by the power of example.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden on COVID pandemic: ‘We will get through this together’\n\nBiden called on Americans to combat the raging coronavirus pandemic as one nation – and said it must in order to prevail.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other,” Biden said. “We must finally meet this pandemic as one nation. We will get through this together -- together.\"\n\nBiden then led a silent prayer for the 400,000 Americans who have died from the COVID-19 virus.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden decries violence threatening democracy: ‘Not ever’\n\nBiden noted the resilience of the country enduring through violence, whether during the Civil War, protests 108 years ago against women’s suffrage, or the riot Jan. 6.\n\n“Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed during the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance,” Biden said. “Yet we endured, we prevailed.”\n\nBiden said the country was being tested, but would rise to resolve disputes without violence.\n\n“Here we stand across the Potomac, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace,” Biden said. “Here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground.\n\n“It did not happen,” Biden added. “It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. Not ever.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden speaks to Trump voters\n\nAddressing those who did not vote for him, Biden asked that they “hear me out as we move forward.\n\n“Take your measure of me and my heart,” he said. “If you still disagree, so be it. That’s democracy.”\n\nEven if opponents can’t support him, Biden said, he will still fight as hard for them as he will for those who backed his candidacy.\n\n“I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans,” he said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden calls for unity: ‘Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire’\n\nIn a call for unity, Biden said, “Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire” as he called for Americans to “start fresh” and come together to meet the crises of the times.\n\n“I believe America is so much better than this,” Biden said, noting that throughout history America has prevailed over division.\n\n\"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new,” he said. “History, faith and reason show the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this challenge as the United States of America. I guarantee you that if we do that we will not fail.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n`Speed and urgency’\n\nBiden promised to press forward with “speed and urgency,” saying there is much to do in” this winter of peril.”\n\nFew people have been more challenged or found a time more challenging, Biden said. Many jobs have been lost, businesses have closed and there’s a cry for racial justice.\n\n“The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer,” Biden said.\n\nHe pledged to confront and defeat the rise of political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism.\n\nBut doing so will require the most important part of democracy, he added: unity.\n\n“For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage,” he said. “Unity is the path forward.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden notes bipartisan recognition of inauguration\n\nBiden welcomed former presidents of both parties to his inauguration, welcoming to them to “this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago, violence sought to shake the Capitol’s very foundation,” to carry out the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama sat behind him. Biden said he spoke with former President Jimmy Carter, who was unable to attend, but whom Biden saluted for his lifetime of service.\n\nBut Biden’s immediate predecessor, former President Donald Trump, flew to Florida on Wednesday morning rather than attend the event. Former Vice President Mike Pence did attend the event.\n\n“I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today,” Biden said. “I thank them from the bottom of my heart.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden begins inaugural address: ‘This is democracy’s day’\n\nAfter being sworn in as president 12 minutes before noon, Biden began his inaugural address declaring, “Democracy has prevailed.”\n\n“This is America's day,” Biden said. “This is democracy’s day, a day of history and hope, of renewal of resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew. And America has risen to the challenge.\"\n\n\"Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people -- the will of the people -- have been heard.\"\n\nThe inauguration came two weeks after the Capitol was under assault by a group of pro-Trump supporters who stormed Congress while it was counting electoral votes.\n\nBiden was introduced to the podium by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a chair of the Inaugural Committee.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden officially sworn in as 46th president of the United States\n\nJoe Biden was sworn in Wednesday as the 46th president of the United States, marking the official start to an administration that must now turn its attention to the global coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil and deep divisions about the state of American politics and leadership.\n\nForty-eight years after he entered Congress as the junior senator from Delaware, Biden stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and recited the oath of office enshrined in the Constitution - words that have been spoken by his predecessors, dating back to President George Washington.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office.\n\nFacing a raging pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans, the inaugural festivities were stripped of much of their pomp and circumstance, but the symbolism of the peaceful transfer of power - a bedrock principle of American democracy - was nevertheless clear. Lawmakers and former presidents of both parties and members of the Supreme Court, wearing masks as they took their seats, were on hand to witness the ceremony.\n\nBiden, 78, takes the helm at a precarious moment in U.S. history, as the nation continues its struggle with the deadly virus and the logistical challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of people. He also enters office just days after a mob supporting former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, underscoring simmering tensions in national politics that Biden must confront to advance his agenda.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nKamala Harris sworn in as vice president, making history as first woman of color in the office\n\nVice President Kamala Harris took the oath office in a barrier-breaking ceremony Wednesday that recognized her the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American to hold the office.\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, was sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a trailblazer in her own right as the first Latina justice on the high court.\n\nShe used two bibles previously belonging to the late civil rights icon and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Harris has said inspired her career path, and family friend Regina Shelton, who was like a second mother to Harris and her sister. Harris used Shelton's bible when she took the oath of office as California Attorney General and later as a U.S. senator.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden, Harris introduced at inauguration ceremony\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and wife Dr. Jill Biden were introduced at the inauguration ceremony at 11:18 am. They walked out the Capitol’s west doors, down the steps and were greeted with applause.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff were introduced shortly beforehand.\n\nIt came after former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Supreme Court justices and outgoing Vice President Mike Pence took their seats. The introductions occurred around the same time outgoing President Donald Trump, who is not attending the ceremony, landed in Florida on Air Force One.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a chairwoman of the Inaugural Committee, began the ceremony by acknowledging the attack on the Capitol two weeks ago by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nShe said it “awakened us to our responsibility as Americans.”\n\n“This is the day when our democracy picks ourselves up, brushes off the dust and does what America always does: goes forward as a nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nLawmakers put partisanship, attack on Capitol aside for the day\n\nAhead of Biden’s inauguration, lawmakers said they were hoping to put aside partisan bickering for the day and were determined not to be intimidated by the attack earlier this month at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“This is what it's all about. It's a peaceful transition of power, not what happened last week,'' Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., said referring to the Jan. 6 attack. He said it's important for both parties to work together. “We’re all great Americans and this country will move forward peacefully,” he said. “It's a great day for America.\"\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle said it was important to show resilience after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and said they were glad the inauguration went on as planned. “Today is about hope and opportunity,” said Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio and the new chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nIncluded among those in attendance were an array of Republican lawmakers who have vehemently opposed Biden, including some who objected to counting Electoral College votes in hopes of overturning results for Trump.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin, who was among those, said Inauguration Day was not the time for partisanship.\n\n“On a day like today, for a moment, our country pauses in some of those most spirited of debates, but I am sure it will be renewed in earnest once President Biden is sworn in,” Zeldin, R-N.Y., said. “I think the key is how we debate, and how we disagree.”\n\nZeldin noted the intense divisions in the country, something he said would take time to mend.\n\n“I'm not going to make believe that our country is imminently on the verge of this perfect healing and unity that is going to start, you know, miraculously two hours from now,” he said hours before Biden’s inauguration. “I think we have to look really, not just in how we engage on these issues short term, but also this is a conversation for long term.”\n\n— Christal Hayes and Deb Barfield Berry\n\nPomp and circumstance … for a smaller crowd\n\nThe crowd may be smaller, but there’s still a lot of pomp and circumstance for Joe Biden’s inaugural.\n\nThe front of the Capitol is adorned with large American flags. The Marine Band is serenading guests with patriotic music. The arrival of dignitaries is announced over a loudspeaker and with a drumroll.\n\nTickets for the swearing-in ceremony were strictly limited as a safety precaution because of the coronavirus pandemic, which means a much smaller crowd than previous inaugurals. In past years, the West Front lawn has been packed, and those who weren’t fortunate enough to get a seat were jammed into a standing-room-only section.\n\nThis time, seats are spaced six feet apart as a covid safety protocol. And what is normally the standing-room-only section is filled by members of the news media.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump hands out another late pardon: Judge Jeanine Pirro's ex-husband\n\nLess than an hour before the end of his presidency, President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced one more last-minute pardon: The ex-husband of For News host Judge Jeanine Pirro.\n\nAlbert Pirro, Jr., a former real estate associate of Trump's, was convicted on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.\n\nThe grant can be added to the list of nearly 150 pardons and commutations that the White House released in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n—David Jackson\n\nPence greeted by applause\n\nA hatless Mike Pence nodded at the applause as he walked onto the West Front for Biden’s inauguration. An American flag pin was attached to his overcoat. (Four years ago, Pence had to borrow an overcoat for his own swearing-in when his coat was put into the wrong limousine.)\n\nPence held hands with his wife Karen as he walked through the Capitol one last time as vice president.\n\nHe greeted former President George W. Bush when he reached the seating area for past White House occupants. He also chatted with former Vice President Dan Quayle, a fellow Hoosier.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nSen. Hawley, other Republicans who objected to Biden’s win, attend inauguration\n\nA bevy of Republicans who worked feverishly to undermine Biden’s win and objected to the Electoral College count on Jan. 6 attended the inauguration – including several leaders of that effort to block the Nov. 3 election results.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, the first Senate Republican to say he would object to the election count, attended, along with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who quickly followed Hawley’s lead. Cruz was wearing a mask that read, “Come and Take It,” with a canon and a star.\n\nAmong House Republicans, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he wanted to be part of the “pageantry” even though he repeatedly touted false claims that Biden’s win was not legitimate. He argued that key swing states “unilaterally” changed voting rules to favor Democrats.\n\n“This is as close to pageantry as we get in American,” Jordan told reporters on Capitol Hill before Biden took the oath of office. “This and the State of the Union address, and I just think it’s important that you attend those events.”\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden to install interim leadership at Justice Department\n\nThe incoming Biden administration is moving to install interim leadership at the Justice Department, tapping career Justice official Monty Wilkinson to serve as acting attorney general until the Senate weighs the confirmation of nominee Merrick Garland, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.\n\nJohn Carlin, a former assistant attorney general in Obama administration, is President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to serve as acting deputy attorney general until nominee Lisa Monaco can be confirmed by the Senate, said the source who is not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe moves come as acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen steps down Wednesday.\n\nRosen has served as the nation’s interim chief law enforcement officer since the Dec. 23 departure of William Barr, once one of President Donald Trump most prominent defenders.\n\n— Kevin Johnson\n\nHero Capitol Police officer escorts Kamala Harris\n\nEugene Goodman, the Capitol Police officer who led rioters away from the Senate chamber on Jan. 6, is escorting Vice President-elect Kamala Harris at the inauguration Wednesday.\n\nGoodman went viral earlier this month after a video showed him leading a mob of white men away from the Senate floor, potentially saving lives.\n\nIn the viral video, Goodman, who is Black, pushes a member of the mob, a man wearing a black QAnon shirt later identified as Doug Jensen from Des Moines.\n\nAs a result, Jensen chased Goodman, who led him and the mob away from the Senate floor. The mob followed him into a group of police in a back corridor outside the Senate. Jensen was later arrested by the FBI on five federal charges.\n\nLegislation has been introduced to award a Congressional Gold Medal for Goodman.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nDignitaries arrive at Capitol\n\nSeveral former presidents are among the dignitaries arriving at the Capitol for Joe Biden’s inauguration.\n\nCongressional leaders, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and others have taken their place on the platform ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and their spouses were all introduced before taking their seats on the big stage.\n\nEach arrival is announced over a loudspeaker and, in some cases, accompanied by a drumroll.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nBiden, Harris arrive at Capitol for inauguration\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris arrived at the Capitol at 10:30 a.m. ET before they will be sworn in as the 46h president and 49th vice president.\n\nAfter exiting the motorcade, the Senate chairs of the Inaugural Committee, Sens. Roy Blunt-R-Mo. and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., greeted them.\n\nBiden held hands with his wife Dr. Jill Biden as they walked up the steps of the Capitol and Harris held hands with husband Doug Emhoff. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell greeted the couples at the top of the Capitol steps before they entered the building.\n\nBiden and Harris waved below after reaching the Capitol’s door. The couples attended a church service earlier in the morning at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nSecurity at top of mind for lawmakers after Capitol attack\n\nSecurity remained a top focus of lawmakers arriving for Biden’s inauguration, a concern looming over the typical celebrations of Inauguration Day.\n\nLawmakers had been briefed before the event about what should happen if there was an emergency but some have taken additional precautions, such as purchasing body armor, after the attack at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month.\n\nRep. Susan Wild, D-Penn., had what she believes was a panic attack on Jan. 6 as protesters stormed the House chambers. She says she took several days to regroup after the trauma and had gone back and forth before deciding to attend Biden's inauguration.\n\n“I don't ever want to go through again what I went through on the 6th,” she told USA TODAY in an interview. “I hope we have learned something from that experience. And by we, I mean, the security forces who are charged with the responsibility of making sure that Congress is safe.”\n\nWild said she thought critically about whether she would attend Biden’s inauguration after the attack.\n\n“I kind of went back and forth on it,” she said. “But I am now feeling pretty confident about the security measures that have been put into place.”\n\nWild said the attack altered her sense of security and “it obviously puts everything in a different light, you start to really be very, very aware of your surroundings.”\n\nWild isn’t alone.\n\nRep. Peter Meijer, a Michigan Republican who voted to impeach Trump over the insurrection at the Capitol, said many of his colleagues have been thinking critically about their safety.\n\n“Many of us are altering our routines, working to get body armor, which is a reimbursable purchase that we can make,\" Meijer told MSNBC. \"It's sad we have to get to that point. But our expectation is that someone may try to kill us.\"\n\nThe scenes surrounding the U.S. Capitol have been surreal as thousands of National Guard troops have guarded blocks surrounding the National Mall and most of downtown Washington. Seven-foot fences with barbed wire were erected to further secure the area.\n\n“I feel safe for the inauguration. I like to think it's an overabundance of caution because no one likes the picture of fortress Washington,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. “It's a bit disturbing and a picture that could have been avoided.”\n\nWild said the attack has left members of Congress with a new sense of empathy for those who are targeted in attacks, such as mass shootings.\n\n“It certainly has opened the eyes of people like me who have never been in that kind of situation. It gives you a new empathy and sympathy for people who are in school shootings are or in crisis situations, not of their own making,” she said. “We all wonder how we would react. Many of us in Congress now have a sense of how we would react.”\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nBiden attends Mass ahead of inauguration\n\nAs outgoing President Donald Trump flew out of Washington on Air Force One Wednesday morning, President-elect Joe Biden attended Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, his only event before he will be sworn in as the 46th president at noon.\n\nHe was joined by his spouse Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, as well as congressional leaders from both parties.\n\nThe Bidens had a front-row pew, with Harris and Emhoff on the other side of the aisle, also in the front. The couples stood in silent reflection looking at the front altar. All attendees wore masks and were spread out in the cathedral to follow social-distancing standards.\n\nThe Bidens arrived shortly before 9 a.m. ET after taking a short trip from the Blair House, the White House guesthouse where the new first couple stayed overnight.\n\nEn route, Biden’s motorcade drove on streets guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops and storefronts boarded over with plywood after the Jan. 6 Capitol assault.\n\nBiden wore a navy suit and navy overcoat, both by American designer Ralph Lauren. Jill Biden had on an ocean blue wool tweed coat and dress by American designer Alexandra O’Neil of Markarian.\n\nCongressional leaders who attended the service included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\n\nMedia was led out of the cathedral shortly after 9 a.m. as the service was ongoing. Biden and other worshippers left the church shortly before 10 a.m. ET before departing for the Capitol.\n\n—Joey Garrison\n\nLawmakers and guests ready for inauguration, 'renewal'\n\nBiden’s inauguration is a scaled-down affair, and lawmakers weren’t allowed to bring as many guests as in years past, but they were still excited for the proceedings.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa, was so enthusiastic for the inauguration, her very first ever, that she went for a run along the river at sunrise. Some Democrats saw it as an opportunity for the nation to change after Trump.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., called it a “renewal,” and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said “maybe our nation can heal now.”\n\nAnd Pete Buttigieg, Biden’s Transportation Secretary nominee, told USA TODAY it was “really moving” to be at the inauguration, calling it an opportunity to “turn the page.”\n\nRep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., reflected on the moment, calling the inauguration, “The symbol of democracy for all the world to see. This is where it began with the ability to transfer power, even against the backdrop of a lot of anger.”\n\nFormer Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, also a Republican, said he expects Biden to model \"better behavior.\"\n\n\"It's one of the rites of passage for president and the peaceful transfer of power. The best day we have in terms of rituals, so I'm glad it's happening,\" Flake said. \"I think Americans will sleep easier knowing that we have a more steady hand in the White House. Regardless of philosophy or disagreement, we have a steady hand.\"\n\n—Nicholas Wu\n\nOne tradition followed: Trump leaves letter for Biden\n\nTrump has eschewed most traditional roles a president fills during the the transition to a successor, except one: He has left a letter for Biden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere confirmed Wednesday that Trump left a note for the incoming president. Presidents usually leave a note of congratulations and support in the Oval Office, but some had questioned whether Trump would do so given his hesitancy to acknowledge Biden’s victory.\n\nThe White House did not release contents of Trump's note: \"It’s a letter between 45 and 46,\" Deere said.\n\nDonald Trump's last day:President leaves a note for Biden before departing for Mar-a-Lago\n\n“We are just temporary occupants of this office,” President Barack Obama wrote to Trump in his own letter in 2017. “That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions – like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties – that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.”\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nBiden to be sworn in at noon\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. is hours away from being sworn in as the 46th president of the United States during a ceremony on the U.S. Capitol steps embodying the peaceful transition of power that stands as a hallmark of American democracy.\n\nBut this will be a presidential inauguration like no other.\n\nInstead of the throngs of supporters hailing from all corners of the country to celebrate Biden's ascension, the new president will raise his right hand in front of a sparse audience of well-wishers that will not include Donald Trump – the first time since 1869 that an outgoing president has refused to attend his successor's inauguration.\n\nInstead of thousands of people gathering on the National Mall for the festivities, the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will be replaced by a virtual parade that will be televised while thousands of National Guard troops patrol the nation's capital.\n\nAnd instead of basking in the glow of his convincing electoral triumph, Biden, 78, will be taking over the nation as millions question his legitimacy two weeks after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol building over baseless claims of election fraud.\n\nMore:Joe Biden ran on bringing back normalcy. With COVID, riots and a looming impeachment trial, that task just got tougher\n\nAll this as Biden will emphasize the need for the country to come together. The theme for the inauguration will be “America United.\"\n\nShortly before noon on the steps of the west entrance of the Capitol, Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, becoming the first woman, as well as the first Black or Asian American, to assume the post.\n\nThen at roughly noon, Biden will put his hand on the Bible as Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office. His inaugural address will lay out his vision for solving the nation's problems, like a spiraling COVID pandemic and a reeling economy.\n\nWhile Trump won't attend, departing Vice President Mike Pence will be there.\n\nMore:Farewell address: Trump stresses record, condemns Capitol riot, does not name Biden\n\nPence has chosen to welcome the incoming president rather than join a planned send-off for Trump earlier in the morning at Joint Base Andrews where, the departing president will climb aboard Air Force for one final trip to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDespite the turmoil surrounding the 59th Inaugural Ceremonies Wednesday, there will be some familiar moments: a national anthem (sung by Lady Gaga), a poetry reading (by Amanda Gorman) and a musical performance (by Jennifer Lopez).\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden’s inaugural address to push unity to meet ‘extraordinary challenges’\n\nAddressing a deeply divided nation, Biden will call for unity in his inaugural speech Wednesday in an appeal to “bring the country together during an unprecedented moment of crisis,” advisors to the president-elect said.\n\nThe speech, echoing the themes the Democratic former vice president campaigned on, is expected to run 20 to 30 minutes, according to a source familiar with the speech.\n\nAfter he’s sworn in as the 46th president, Biden will address a nation on edge — one in the thick of a global pandemic that has killed 400,000 Americans and struggling to recover economically.\n\nThe speech comes amid heightened security concerns after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress counted electoral votes. Surveys have found more than 60% of Republicans who supported Trump falsely believe Trump was the rightful winner of the election.\n\nTrump, who leveled baseless claims of voter fraud to unsuccessfully overturn the election, is skipping the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend.\n\nBiden’s remarks will “be a forward-looking vision for his presidency while addressing the moment we are living in as a country,” advisors said, noting the speech is built around a theme of unity.\n\n–Joey Garrison\n\nHow does the public feel about Biden and Harris? Keener on the former\n\nKamala Harris is taking on her new role with less public support than Joe Biden has, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\n\nWhile 58% of U.S. adults surveyed this month approved of the job Biden is doing, views of Harris were more divided. Half said she’s qualified to serve as president, while 47% said she is not.\n\nFour years ago, 54% of those surveyed said Mike Pence is qualified to be president if something were to happen to Donald Trump.\n\nMost Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents – 82% -- said Harris could step in, if needed, for Biden. But nearly the same share of Republicans and Republican leaders said she is not qualified.\n\nMost Democrats said Harris will have the right amount of influence in the new administration. But seven out of ten Republicans said she will have too much.\n\n—Maureen Groppe\n\nKamala Harris will swear in new senators as VP\n\nIn her first day as vice president — the first who is a woman, who is Black, who is of South Asian descent — Kamala Harris will swear in three new senators.\n\nHer replacement, Democrat Alex Padilla, will become California’s first Hispanic senator. Padilla and Georgia Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the state’s first Black and Jewish senators, respectively, will be sworn in at about 4:30 p.m.\n\nWith these three new Senators sworn in, Harris will officially be the tie-breaking vote in a 50-50 split Senate.\n\nHarris will deliver some of her first remarks as Vice President Wednesday evening at the Lincoln Memorial as part of the “Celebrating America” inaugural program.\n\nHarris is to be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and will take her oath on two Bibles. One belongs to Thurgood Marshall, who was the Supreme Court’s first Black justice and a civil rights icon. The other Bible belongs to Regina Shelton, a neighbor and nursery school operator who was like a second mother to Harris and her sister Maya growing up.\n\n—Rebecca Morin and Michael Collins\n\nTrump departs as Biden starts his day\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have left Joint Base Andrews at 9 a.m. on Air Force One, headed for Florida and their home at Mar-a-Lago following a speech to supporters.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, is attending mass at St. Matthews Cathedral in Washington before traveling to the U.S. Capitol for the start of his inauguration ceremony at noon ET.\n\n'We are not a regular administration'\n\nTrump bid farewell to supporters and family Wednesday for one final time as commander-in-chief in a nine-minute speech recalling his administration's successes over the last four years.\n\n\"We were not a regular administration,\" he told a crowd of supporters, family and staff at Joint Base Andrews, located in Maryland just outside Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we’ve done has been amazing by any standard,\" Trump said, recounting the highlights of his administration he has often noted during campaign rallies - the creation of Space Force, changes to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the 2017 tax bill.\n\nThe event had the look and feel of a Trump campaign rally, with Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" blaring from loudspeakers as Marine One arrived early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe president's children and their spouses as well as his chief of staff Mark Meadows were all in attendance, lined up along the side of the podium as the president spoke. Trump took the stage as \"Hail to the Chief\" played over a 21-gun salute and the crowd cheered, \"we love you!\"\n\n\"I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success,\" Trump said of incoming President Joe Biden, never mentioning his successor by name. \"They have the foundation to do something really spectacular.\"\n\n\"I hope they don’t raise your taxes,\" Trump said in one of his only references to Biden. \"But if you do, I told you so.\"\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also spoke, telling the crowd that being first lady was her \"great honor.\"\n\nThe president's departure ceremony bucked more than 150 years of tradition of attending his successor's inauguration. He plans to be at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., when Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president at noon.\n\n\"I will always fight for you. I will be watching and I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better,\" he said as he concluded his remark before boarding Air Force One.\n\n\"So just a goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\" Trump told the crowd, thanking Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence as well as members of Congress. \"Have a good life. We will see you soon.\"\n\nThe crowd looked on as Trump took off as president for one final time on Air Force One, with Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" playing over the loudspeaker.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nPence gets brief nod from Trump\n\nAfter four years of intense loyalty followed by a major break with his boss, Vice President Mike Pence got a brief nod from President Donald Trump in the outgoing president’s final public remarks.\n\n“I want to thank our vice president, Mike Pence and Karen,” Trump said near the end of about 10 minutes of comments before he got on plane to Florida.\n\nTrump spoke at a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews that Pence did not attend. Unlike Trump, Pence will be at President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony.\n\n'Man without a home':What the future may hold for Vice President Mike Pence\n\nPence’s relationship with Trump has been strained since the vice president concluded he could not intervene to stop Congress from accepting the electoral votes on Jan. 6.\n\nAfter mentioning Pence, Trump also thanked Congress.\n\n“Because we really worked well with Congress -- at least certain elements of Congress,” he added as a made a “so-so” gesture with his hand while supporters laughed.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, with the support of 10 Republicans, voted to impeach Trump last week for inciting insurrection. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday, said the mob who swarmed the Capitol as Congress was counting the elector votes was “provoked by the president.”\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump leaves White House for last time\n\nTrump left the White House shortly after 8 a.m. ET Wednesday on his way to the Maryland base – taking his final flight as president on Marine One.\n\nTrump emerged onto the South Lawn with first lady Melania Trump at 8:12 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaking briefly with reporters, Trump said it was the “honor of a lifetime” to serve as president. Marine One lifted off the South Lawn at 8:18 a.m. ET and toured over the National Mall before heading toward Maryland.\n\nTrump, who is skipping the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, is heading to Joint Base Andrews, where he’ll take part in a ceremony, and then on to Florida. Trump is expected to make remarks at the suburban Maryland military base.\n\nThe optics of the departure from the White House was highly unusual: A sitting president generally travels to the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration of a successor. Then, the former president usually walks down the stairs with the new president and takes off from there, a potent symbol of the peaceful handover of power.\n\nTrump, the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to attend the inauguration of his successor, is heading for his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, which he dubbed the \"Winter White House.\" The White House has invited hundreds of supporters to a pomp-and-circumstance ceremony at the air base, one expected to feature a red carpet and military color guard – and perhaps a preview of another Trump presidential run in 2024.\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nBiden asks surgeon general to resign\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden asked for the resignation of Surgeon General Jerome Adams.

SpaceX had hoped to debut the Falcon Heavy before the end of this year in a launch from Kennedy Space Center, but the timeline is unknown following the Sept. 1 launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nNASA's SLS rocket, targeting a first launch from KSC in late 2018, will produce 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.\n\nLike SpaceX with its Falcon rockets, Blue Origin plans to recover and reuse the New Glenn's first-stage boosters, which measure 23 feet in diameter — nearly double the width of a Falcon 9 booster. Bezos offered no information on launch costs, but he believes reusability is essential to lowering costs and to expanding access to space.\n\nBlue Origin has already proven its ability to land and re-fly smaller boosters, doing so four times with its suborbital New Shepard vehicle — named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space — during unmanned test flights at the company's private range in Texas.\n\nA fifth unmanned test is planned next month that will abort the New Shepard crew capsule from its booster mid-flight, while it is experiencing peak aerodynamic pressure, to simulate a crew's ability to escape a failing rocket.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears in new 'Star Trek' movie\n\nBezos said lessons learned from New Shepard, which could begin flying paying passengers in 2018, have informed the design of New Glenn.\n\nBezos' introduction of New Glenn came almost exactly a year after he visited Launch Complex 36 to announce Blue Origin's decision to build and launch orbital rockets in Brevard County.\n\nThe company in May broke ground on a 475,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Exploration Park, at the southern edge of KSC on Merritt Island, that will stand up to eight stories tall and longer than two football fields.\n\nThe factory could be ready to start producing rocket stages in late 2017 or early 2018.\n\nBezos said Monday that the basic two-stage New Glenn rocket could be bolstered by a third stage for \"demanding beyond-LEO missions,\" or those beyond low Earth orbit. The third stage would be powered by a hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine like those flying now on the New Shepard.\n\nSuch missions might include launches of very large satellites that currently require heavy-lift rockets to reach high orbits, but Bezos teased that Blue Origin was preparing for deep space flights as it pursues his vision to have \"millions of people living and working in space.\"\n\nHe said a vehicle named \"New Armstrong\" — presumably after first-man-on-the-moon Neil Armstrong — was next up on the company's drawing board.\n\n\"But that's a story for the future,\" Bezos said.\n\nThe BE-4 engine that Blue Origin is developing for its own orbital rockets, each producing 550,000 pounds of thrust, is also the leading candidate to power United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan rocket. A big upcoming decision from Blue Origin is where it decides to build those engines, and the company has said Florida is among the contenders.\n\nFollow James Dean on Twitter: @flatoday_jdean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2015/04/09/blue-origin-eyes-cape-build-launch-rockets/25505063/", "title": "Blue Origin eyes Cape Canaveral to build, launch rockets", "text": "James Dean\n\nFLORIDA TODAY\n\nA billionaire-backed company that aspires to make human spaceflight more affordable would build rockets near Kennedy Space Center and launch them from Cape Canaveral if state officials can secure its commitment in the coming weeks.\n\nBlue Origin, founded in 2000 by Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, could choose from among several states as soon as next month. Brevard County is a contender to win a rocket manufacturing site and up to 300 jobs in preparation for orbital launches in the next five years.\n\n\"I have talked to Jeff Bezos, urging him to come to the Cape,\" U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson told FLORIDA TODAY, confirming Seattle-based Blue Origin is the company the state has been wooing under the code name of Project Panther.\n\nBlue Origin's arrival would be a boost for the Space Coast's future in the commercial space sector, not long after SpaceX chose Texas as a commercial launch site.\n\nIt would also mark a successful conclusion to a deal forced to shift gears late when the company's preferred launch site near Volusia County ran into obstacles, threatening the state's bid.\n\nThe state's revised proposal would have Blue Origin set up a manufacturing site in Exploration Park, a planned research and industrial complex outside KSC's south gate, and launch from Launch Complex 36, a state-run pad on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nBlue Origin so far has confirmed only that Florida is one of the states it is considering for orbital launches. \"We're hoping to make a decision about that soon,\" said company President Rob Meyerson.\n\nThe company plans to begin flight tests this year of a suborbital spacecraft designed to carry at least three people. It is also developing an engine to power a new rocket for United Launch Alliance, the U.S. government's primary launcher of high-value missions.\n\nFighting for Shiloh\n\nTalks about the so-called Project Panther initially focused on the state's proposed Shiloh commercial launch complex, which straddles the Brevard-Volusia border on property NASA shares with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. A rocket factory would have been located in nearby Oak Hill in southern Volusia County.\n\nBlue Origin was one of the first commercial space companies to express interest in the Shiloh site after Space Florida in 2012 asked NASA for 200 acres of land there for one or two launch pads.\n\nLike SpaceX, which plans to build a private launch complex in Texas, Blue Origin believes commercial launchers need facilities outside NASA or Air Force control to thrive, just as commercial aviation operates independently from military bases.\n\nBlue Origin will fly its New Shepard suborbital capsule from its own private range in western Texas, a step toward development of an orbital rocket and spacecraft.\n\n\"Blue Origin's got a very long-term vision to extend human-kind beyond our planet,\" Meyerson told reporters Tuesday during a briefing about the company's completion of a new rocket engine. \"We're committed to making space travel more reliable, accessible and affordable so that one day millions of people are living and working in space.\"\n\nSpeculation about the company's pursuit of operations at Shiloh and in Volusia County began in February when the owner of a 400-acre property in Oak Hill sought a zoning change to permit manufacturing.\n\nAround the same time, a site selector working for Blue Origin met with representatives from environmental organizations, and described Project Panther as a company interested in Shiloh and a competitor to SpaceX.\n\nShiloh opponents, upset by the project's secrecy and worried it might involve hazardous operations near the refuge and Canaveral National Seashore, fought the zoning change.\n\n\"I made it very clear to them that we intended to fight Shiloh as long as practicable,\" said Clay Henderson, a New Smyrna Beach attorney working on behalf of several environmental groups. \"We think we can keep it tied up indefinitely, given the inordinate amount of environmental issues and historic preservation issues associated with it.\"\n\nOak Hill city commissioners approved a first look at the zoning change by a 4-1 vote. But the Florida Audubon Society and Southeast Volusia Audubon Society challenged the decision, and it faces a review this month by the Volusia Growth Management Commission.\n\nOutside the fences\n\nIn addition to those delays, a potential Shiloh deal hit another snag that threw Florida's prospects into doubt.\n\nBlue Origin and Space Florida wanted assurance that NASA would provide the Shiloh land if an ongoing environmental review determined the site was feasible.\n\nBut NASA would not provide that conditional support, saying it had to wait until after the Federal Aviation Administration completed the environmental study, which could take another year or more.\n\nKSC, which is touting its transformation into a multi-user spaceport, instead encouraged the company to consider alternatives outlined in KSC's master plan. The plan suggests two locations for commercial launch pads near the center's two existing pads.\n\n\"We believe that KSC offers the broadest number of development options that would be responsive to the partner's needs, and this project could be a celebrated cornerstone in our quest to establish a multi-user spaceport,\" Scott Colloredo, head of KSC's Center Planning and Development Office, wrote in a January letter to Space Florida, provided to FLORIDA TODAY in response to a public records request.\n\nSpace Florida has questioned the viability of KSC's proposed sites, saying they are situated in wetlands that would be more environmentally damaging than Shiloh and prohibitively expensive to develop, and that they are too close to NASA's primary pad and would shut down Titusville's access to Playalinda Beach during launch activity.\n\nAs the Shiloh-Volusia option began to appear too uncertain, the state's Launch Complex 36 surfaced as a backup worth a closer look.\n\nIt did not fit Blue Origin's initial request to be based outside KSC or Air Force fences.\n\nBut the company may decide the Air Force Station offers a faster path to flight than sites in Georgia, North Carolina or another state, which would also require lengthy environmental reviews. It would also be less expensive because some infrastructure is already in place, compared to starting from scratch elsewhere.\n\nAnd Blue Origin may have more confidence that the Air Force will offer increased flexibility to commercial operators, making Launch Complex 36 good enough for now while efforts to approve the Shiloh site continue.\n\nKeeping commercial space in Florida\n\nMembers of Florida's congressional delegation, led by Sen. Nelson, have been pressuring the Air Force and NASA to find ways to accommodate emerging commercial space businesses rather than driving them away. They have been involved in discussions about Project Panther, as has Florida Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nIf Blue Origin does end up choosing another state, however, it would expose severe shortcomings in the Cape's commercial viability.\n\nAlready, SpaceX plans commercial launches from Texas, Orbital ATK chose to launch from Virginia, and Virgin Galactic will fly a suborbital spaceship from New Mexico.\n\nNot wanting Blue Origin to join that list, Nelson, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Bill Posey jointly wrote a letter supporting Space Florida's efforts to lure Project Panther and grow commercial activity at the Cape.\n\nThey encouraged the state to pursue agreements with the Air Force and NASA enabling \"streamlined business operations\" for commercial operations whether on or off federal property, according to the Feb. 20 letter.\n\nThe letter concludes: \"We now look forward to a new era of human space flight — an era where commercial endeavors settle the frontier of space as NASA presses farther out in the solar system — an era where explorers, adventurers, travelers, and settlers continue to look to Florida as their port of departure to the cosmos.\"\n\nContact Dean at 321-242-3668 or jdean@floridatoday.com.

But now the company says it is doing away with that plan, seeking a more “cost effective” alternative, Blue Origin spokesperson Linda Mills said.\n\nIt is not clear what will happen to the Jacklyn, as the ship is called, which Bezos dedicated to his mother in a small ceremony in Pensacola, Florida in December 2020. Blue Origin could still use the ship for another purpose or abandon the project altogether. Mills said the company is “still assessing options.”\n\nOne alternative to the big ship is to opt for an autonomous, seafaring platform or barge, much like the droneships that SpaceX uses to catch its rockets after flight.\n\nThe retrofit and maintenance of the Jacklyn was being carried out at the Port of Pensacola. The ship is seen here on Tuesday, April 19, 2022. Tony Giberson/USA TODAY NETWORK/Imagn\n\nBlue Origin wanted to sail the Jacklyn out into the Atlantic Ocean to catch itsNew Glenn rocket boosters.When the large first-stage booster that gives the initial thrust at liftoff expends most of its fuel, it is designed to detach from the upper stage of the rocket and make a controlled pinpoint landing on Earth, just as SpaceX already does with its Falcon 9 rockets.\n\nBlue Origin’s website still references landing its rockets on a ship, rather than a barge, touting that it allows the booster to land in turbulent ocean conditions. Theoretically, a massive ship could remain steady in rough waters, allowing Blue Origin to carry out its booster retrieval operations in all types of weather.\n\nBut that plan would have required the Jacklyn, a former cargo ship built in 2004, to undergo extensive retrofitting — including the installation of a massive platform for the rocket to target. Mills declined to say how much the refurbishments would have cost.\n\nLanding rocket boosters instead of discarding them in the ocean, as other rocket companies have done for decades, is at the core of SpaceX’s and Blue Origin’s plans to bring down the cost of a launch and ensure profitability.\n\nBlue Origin’s New Glenn rocket is planned to be the first of the company’s rockets that will be capable of reaching orbit, a trek that requires speeds topping 17,000 miles per hour. SpaceX has sent rockets into orbit since 2008.\n\nSo far, Blue Origin has only conducted flights of its much smaller New Shepard suborbital rocket. That rocket has been used to carry paying customers — and last summer, Bezos himself — on brief, supersonic joy rides that reach the edge of what is technically considered space.\n\nNew Glenn is not expected to carry humans, at least at first, but will instead haul satellites and other cargo to orbit.\n\nThough already a couple of years behind its original schedule, Blue Origin is hoping to launch the first New Glenn to orbit by the end of 2022.\n\nDespite the New Glenn never having flown, it has already landed several commercial satellite launch contracts, and NASA selected the rocket as one able to compete for missions that would launch planetary, Earth observation, exploration and scientific satellites.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2017/06/02/spacex-elon-musk-betting-house-proposed-satellite-internet-constellation-fcc/363023001/", "title": "SpaceX bets the house to become satellite internet provider", "text": "SpaceX, the upstart California company that brought the world reusable rockets and dramatically lower launch costs, now has plans to beam broadband internet from space to consumers around the world.\n\nWhy would a rocket manufacturer want to get into the broadband internet business? The hope is to create a cash cow that would enable its founder, industrial superstar Elon Musk, to compete with his arch rival, fellow billionaire and space entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, in the race to make humanity a \"multi-planetary species.\"\n\nBut the risk, some industry analysts say, is huge and Musk may be betting his company's future on the effort.\n\nLast month, SpaceX's vice president of satellite government affairs, Patricia Cooper, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that the company is aiming to launch 4,425 small satellites on Falcon 9 rockets to fully deploy a constellation to low Earth orbit by 2024. The proposal also included an additional 7,518 satellites in orbital planes even closer to the ground.\n\n[SpaceX booster may be displayed near Port Canaveral, Air Force Station]\n\n[Air Force open to flying on used SpaceX rockets]\n\nThe aim is to transmit global internet connectivity to billions of users on the ground through a network of small, smart satellites without digging trenches, laying cables or dealing with property rights. With several companies aiming to launch similar satellite constellations, SpaceX could take a slice of the market. The company already operates a satellite development office near Seattle to make the dream a reality.\n\nMusk's launch services company operates in an industry with ever-present risks and high costs. Successes with his Falcon 9 rocket's reusability have provided some financial improvements, experts say, but the launch industry isn't known as a money-maker. At least not enough of one to fulfill Musk's dream of establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, which will cost billions.\n\nIf interplanetary ambitions are to become reality, SpaceX will likely need a major source of income, something Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and his launch company, Blue Origin, already have. Bezos boasted at a space convention earlier this year that his business model involves little more than him selling a billion dollars a year of his Amazon stock, which topped $1,000 a share this week.\n\n[Boeing's Phantom Express could launch, land at Cape Canaveral]\n\n[OneWeb Satellites breaks ground at KSC's Exploration Park factory]\n\nSome experts see the challenges facing SpaceX – federal regulations, costs and competitors, to name a few – as surmountable, but the massive barrier of entry to the satellite broadband market could mean slimmer profits than expected. Musk may also be late to the game as several companies, most notably OneWeb, which has a Florida manufacturing plant under construction and plans to launch its first satellites in May 2018, have made clear their satellite broadband intentions.\n\nOthers agree that the gambit is a risk with potentially massive rewards that could propel Musk's company to the lucrative field of satellite operations and, ultimately, the red planet itself.\n\nCould Musk, who has already disrupted the automobile and space industry, pull this off?\n\n\"They're betting the house on this,\" said Richard Rocket, CEO and co-founder of NewSpace Global, an information service provider that tracks the space industry.\n\nSpaceX declined to comment for this story.\n\n////\\\\\\\\\n\nSince its founding in 2002, SpaceX's long-term mission has been to make humanity a \"multi-planetary species.\" For Musk, that means the establishment of a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.\n\nChris Quilty, president of Quilty Analytics, a St. Petersburg-based research and consulting firm that focuses on the satellite and space industry, believes satellite communications could provide a financial vehicle for Musk to start funding the trip.\n\n\"If you're in the space business and you're saying, 'Where's the revenue?' it's in satellite communications,\" he said. \"So that's naturally the part of the industry where he's decided to create a business model.\"\n\nThe Satellite Industry Association's latest report agrees: Global revenues were up by 3 percent from 2014 to 2015, bringing the total value of the industry to $208 billion. Launch services, also calculated in the SIA report, is a sliver of that total at $5.4 billion.\n\nEven if the billionaire entrepreneur controlled 100 percent of the launch industry, Quilty said, it's still not enough to fund what he needs to do.\n\nSpaceX will no doubt need many billions of dollars to approach Mars, a point Musk discussed during a Sept. 2016 International Astronautical Federation conference in Guadalajara, Mexico. He reiterated the need for continued cost reduction and hoped to get the per-person to around $200,000 with the goal of transporting a million people.\n\nEarlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX posted a loss in 2015 after a launch mishap during an International Space Station resupply mission and was vulnerable to further dips in the event of failures. The report described the company as having a \"thin bottom line,\" solidifying the need for a profitable satellite constellation.\n\nProfit margins are especially slim on launch vehicles, Rocket said, noting that SpaceX's advances with Falcon 9 reusability have improved the numbers. He expects the margins to be even better with Falcon Heavy, the company's 27-engine vehicle slated to launch for the first time from Kennedy Space Center later this year.\n\nThose achievements aside, Rocket believes SpaceX wouldn't be pursuing the constellation if its leaders weren't confident about the potential.\n\n\"The real money to be made in the near term is in the very terrestrial, existing market of four billion people not having access to internet,\" Rocket said.\n\nTaking advantage of reusability and its position as the lowest-cost launch operator in the industry, SpaceX has an obvious advantage when it comes to launching its proposed broadband constellation. If extra capacity is available during a customer launch, SpaceX could even launch its own small satellites on those missions.\n\n////\\\\\\\\\n\nIf there's one issue that can quickly end SpaceX's – or any other company's – efforts into building wireless systems, it's spectrum.\n\nMuch like two competing radio stations in the same region can't use the same frequency for broadcasts, wireless providers can't use the same frequencies, or spectrum, for their current or future satellite networks. SpaceX's efforts are futile without it.\n\n\"It's asking for several frequencies up in the V band – the 35 GHz bandwidth – which aren't currently allocated for space uses,\" said James Dunstan, the founder of Mobius Legal Group, an outer space and telecommunications law firm. \"It's got a big hurdle there.\"\n\nDunstan said convincing the Federal Communications Commission and its international partner run by the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, to reallocate will not be easy and could take up to five years.\n\nDeveloping space-based broadband internet doesn't stop at securing spectrum and satellite deployment; systems on the ground are needed to relay those transmissions for use by customers. Cooper told the Senate panel that SpaceX would distribute to users through terminals \"roughly the size of a laptop.\"\n\nAdditional details were sparse, but providing adequate coverage through ground equipment is a massive undertaking in and of itself.\n\n\"Even though you're sending your signal down to a box, or a moving platform like a ship, the reality is you still need customer base access,\" said Frank DiBello, president of Space Florida. \"So partners on the ground with network can be really helpful to your overall system deployment.\"\n\nIf SpaceX wants to serve billions of consumers with its broadband service, which it intends to market directly, ground systems will need to be in place across the globe. It's not a small undertaking, but does bring up another issue: Can the billions without internet access afford to pay enough to make it worth the effort?\n\n\"Most developed countries already have pretty robust infrastructure,\" Dunstan said. \"So what you're really talking about is trying to figure out how to monetize – and how to make affordable – satellite internet service in places where people don't have a lot of money.\"\n\nFurther, satellite constellations close to Earth require consistent maintenance due to increased atmospheric drag on their orbits. Dunstan expects that SpaceX's constellation will need satellite replacements and servicing much more often than geostationary networks.\n\nAnd the field isn't without competitors. There are at least 10 companies that filed with the FCC intentions to establish their own satellite internet services. OneWeb, which already has rights and access to existing broadband spectrum, this year broke ground on a manufacturing facility at Kennedy Space Center's Exploration Park. A joint venture between OneWeb and Airbus Group, the company hopes to assemble more than 2,000 of its small, 330-pound satellites at KSC.\n\n\"They seem to have their act together,\" DiBello said. \"Another indicator is the fact that you're watching some pretty savvy investors put money behind them. That wouldn't happen if they weren't answering all the due diligence questions that are the kinds of questions we used to ask.\"\n\n[SpaceX to launch thousands of its own broadband satellites starting in 2019]\n\n[SpaceX to launch virtual reality spacecraft on later ISS mission]\n\nThe company recently secured a $1.2 billion investment from SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications and internet company.\n\nOneWeb is scheduled to launch its first 10 satellites next year on a Soyuz rocket from French Guyana and purchased future launches on Blue Origin's New Glenn rockets, which will also be constructed on the Space Coast.\n\nJust behind OneWeb is aerospace giant Boeing. Also on the list are Audacy, Karousel, LeoSat MA, O3b (now owned by SES), Space Norway, Telesat Canada, Theia Holdings and ViaSat.\n\nThe number of these additional players further complicates the issue of spectrum for SpaceX, Dunstan said.\n\n\"We have a land rush on spectrum for these big new LEO systems,\" he said. \"How the FCC is going to deal with it is a little unclear.\"\n\nSatellite-based broadband isn't new. Current services are known for what is called \"high latency,\" or a delay before data transfers begin, due to their distance from Earth. Their speeds are also usually slower than ground-based options and cost more.\n\nThe organizations looking to future constellations are betting on technological advancements in hardware and software to improve efficiency; closer distances to Earth to mitigate latency issues; smart satellites that can prioritize and de-prioritize regions based on demand; software that can work around spectrum issues; and reduced launch costs.\n\nAll hope that these low-Earth and very-low-Earth orbit constellations can not only deliver performance equal to terrestrial options, but to billions of people.\n\nOf those, only SpaceX controls the ride to orbit. And if it all works, it could give Musk the capability to outcompete would-be rivals while matching Bezos' deep pockets.\n\n\"I think that Elon is somewhat envious of Bezos having that luxury and that independence and is building out a satellite constellation that targets a very existing market,\" Rocket said. \"That could essentially allow SpaceX to have more independence, which is very important to Elon.\"\n\nBut taking all the above challenges into consideration, Dunstan said he doesn't see a Mars-related business plan for the constellation.\n\n\"For me to sit here today and say that a satellite constellation is going to pay for Mars, that's not going to happen,\" Dunstan said. \"I don't see that being a cash cow given just the cost of doing it.\"\n\n////\\\\\\\\\n\nMusk's advantages are hard to deny: His company commands launches at the cheapest prices and has demonstrated significant technical prowess in the form of Falcon 9 reusability.\n\nBut does his celebrity status increase SpaceX's chances at success?\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" DiBello said. \"On this one, you're talking about such a big investment of money for SpaceX. Remember, he's going to have shareholders and other gods who care about how SpaceX as a company does.\"\n\nDiBello believes the company will be slow and deliberate in evaluating the business case for the constellation before fully investing in it.\n\nQuilty, meanwhile, sees Musk's status as a boost.\n\n\"It actually gives him the ability to succeed with such a crazy endeavor where others might say it makes no sense.\"\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

It remained coated with exhaust from engine firings that had slowed its tail-first plunge from space.\n\n“Who cares whether it’s perfectly clean?” said Desch. “The long-term vision should be that these rockets are able to be landed and reused within days, so why waste the time to get paper towels and clean it?”\n\nSpaceX on Monday continues its pursuit of that vision with a planned 4:30 p.m. blastoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by a previously flown — or “flight proven,” as the company calls it — Falcon 9 lifting a Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\n[Weather looks good for SpaceX Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral to ISS]\n\n[321 LAUNCH app: What it is and why you need it]\n\nThe mission, following today's successful launch for Iridium, would mark the 11th time SpaceX has re-launched a rocket since its history-making first re-flight of an orbital booster a year ago.\n\n“I don’t want to get complacent, but I think we understand reusable boosters,” CEO Elon Musk said Feb. 6, after two recycled boosters assisted the successful debut of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nWhat seemed very risky a year ago has quickly won buy-in from customers.\n\nSix of SpaceX’s last nine launches have used pre-flown boosters, not including the Falcon Heavy test flight.\n\n“It’s becoming de rigueur now,” said Martin Halliwell, chief technology officer of Luxembourg-based SES, the first company to take a chance launching on a pre-flown Falcon. “It’s becoming commonplace, which is quite extraordinary in the time of a year.”\n\nWhat has come less quickly is long-promised savings on launches. But it’s still early days in an experiment to make rocket flight more like air travel, opening doors to new endeavors in space and ultimately enabling Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars.\n\n“The big surprise to me is how seamlessly customers have accepted this concept of a reused rocket,” said Chris Quilty, president of Quilty Analytics in St. Petersburg. “What hasn’t happened, maybe to the disappointment of a lot of SpaceX fans, is that they haven’t driven down pricing dramatically.”\n\nBlasting stuff into space is expensive. The traditional \"use-it-and-lose-it\" approach — firing a payload into space on a multi-million-dollar rocket, only to see it fall back to Earth — plays a major role in driving costs.\n\nA long-repeated assertion by Musk and others is that if rockets can be used over and over, spaceflight could become much cheaper and create demand for many more launches.\n\nSo far, discounts for SpaceX’s used rockets have been small, not the 30 percent or more once forecast. At $62 million for a new rocket, SpaceX already offers the lowest price in its class.\n\nSpaceX has said it must first recoup its billion-dollar investment in reusable systems before further cutting the cost of flight. It also needs money to develop a new system Musk envisions as humanity’s ride to Mars, the “Big Falcon Rocket,” or BFR.\n\n[Launch schedule: Upcoming Florida rocket launches and landings]\n\n[Elon Musk deletes SpaceX and Tesla pages on Facebook]\n\nAs soon as April, an improved Falcon 9 that could launch 10 times or more is expected to bring greater cost efficiencies. The current model is retired after two flights.\n\nFor now, customers say reusing rockets gives them more certainty about when they can get to space and start generating revenue from their satellites, without having to wait for a new rocket to roll off a production line and complete tests.\n\nLower-cost launches are key to ambitions for mega-constellations of small satellites to observe Earth or beam global internet access, but no guarantee of their success.\n\n“You still need to make business cases work and find ways of making money,” said Desch. “People who are waiting for three rockets to launch every day of the year, I’m not sure we’re quite there yet.”\n\nSpace industry consultant Jim Muncy, founder of PoliSpace, is bullish, predicting it won't be long before Cape Canaveral hosts 50 to 100 launches a year, thanks to SpaceX’s reusable rockets and another being designed by Blue Origin, the firm backed by Amazon.com founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\n“They didn’t do this as a science experiment,” said Muncy. “They did it because it’s the right answer economically and financially for the industry, for their customers, for themselves as venture.”\n\nAfter SpaceX, Blue Origin is the most committed to resuability. Its suborbital New Shepard has launched and landed five times, and could begin flying people later this year. The much larger New Glenn will be built at Kennedy Space Center, targeting a first launch in 2020.\n\nBut others in the industry appear to be taking their time pursuing reusability, perhaps not convinced it is as fundamental to the future as Musk believes. United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, has eventual plans to recover the main engines from its Vulcan rocket, now under development, by dropping them to a mid-air capture by an aircraft.\n\nFrom the beginning, SpaceX’s focus was not on satellites but a grander vision — reaching the Red Planet.\n\n“Elon Musk is working from a different playbook than everybody else,” said Quilty. “The fact that he was working outside the box that everybody else was living in is what has enabled SpaceX to basically change the rules of the game.”\n\nContact Dean at 321-242-3668 or jdean@floridatoday.com.

Celebrities such as 90-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner and “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades.\n\nAnd all that promises to just be the beginning.\n\nThe trio of space billionaires — Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk — have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year.\n\nBranson v. Bezos\n\nBranson’s and Bezos’ space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk’s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth’s orbit.)\n\nWe’re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles’ safety and some strategic PR.\n\nJeff Bezos spoke about his flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard into space during a press conference on July 20, 2021 in Van Horn, Texas. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were on the first human spaceflight for the company. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.)\n\nThen, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 — nine days before Bezos’ mission.\n\nThat set off an immediate wave of speculation that — although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn’t view his competition with Bezos as a “race” — there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes.\n\nRichard Branson takes off on July 11, 2021 from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth billionaires’ flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.\n\nBezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA’s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk’s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.)\n\nBranson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back.\n\nShaping up suborbital space\n\nBezos’ successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as “honorary guests” — meaning they didn’t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by “Star Trek” fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December.\n\nWilliam Shatner and the NS-18 crew inside the capsule, floating around. Blue Origin\n\nWhile Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.\n\nBlue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft.\n\nRather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where “professional dissent” is “actively stifled.” Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”\n\nInspiration4 flies higher\n\nThough Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX’s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own.\n\nSpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station — higher than any human has traveled this century.\n\nThe passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Inspiration4 crew launched from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 15, 2021. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million.\n\nThe whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch.\n\nStill, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William.\n\nA “disease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in September, adding that includes “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.”\n\nBezos v. Musk\n\nPlaying out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.\n\nBezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one — and it went with Musk’s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company.\n\nBlue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.\n\nBut a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company’s plans to build a lunar lander into question.\n\nThe ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money.\n\nAnd the battle over NASA’s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/tech/blue-origin-rocket-space-launch-thursday-scn/index.html", "title": "Blue Origin successfully completes fourth space tourism mission ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJeff Bezos’ Blue Origin just launched its fourth successful space tourism mission, putting yet another feather in the cap of the company that hopes to make these supersonic joyrides a mainstay of pop culture.\n\nThe six passengers, which include a Blue Origin engineer and five paying customers, boarded their New Shepard capsule Thursday just after sunrise at the company’s West Texas launch facilities. Boosted by a 60-foot-tall rocket, they soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. Their capsule vaulted past the Kármán Line at 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) altitude, which iswidely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins. And at the peak of the flight, they experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and, out their window, sweeping Earthly views.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the trip cost the five paying customers. Blue Origin has not publicly disclosed a fixed per-seat price point, though it had auctioned off a ticket for $28 million. But that was for a seat to ride alongside Bezos himself, and the auction winner didn’t end up going. (He is slated to fly later this year, however.) Blue Origin’s direct competitor, Virgin Galactic, is currently selling seats for $450,000, up from its previous price point of around $250,000.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nThis flight had been slated to include Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, but he dropped out of the mission after Blue Origin announced a schedule change earlier this month. The company cited the need for additional ground tests on the New Shepard rocketas the reason for the delay.\n\nGary Lai, who has been with Blue Origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket’s design, flew in Davidson’s place and was the sole non-paying customer on the flight. Lai’s crewmates included Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer, and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nThe passengers’ New Shepard capsule, which is fully autonomous, deployed plumes of parachutes after diving back into the thickest part of the Earth’s atmosphere and landed with a puff of sand in the Texas desert.\n\nOn the livestream, the passengers could be heard cheering as the capsule made its touchdown, and moments later, they exited the capsule, smiling and waving.\n\n“It was intense, and I did get a little bit of a feeling of vertigo,” Lai told Blue Origin’s Sarah Knights, who heads communications with the passengers during flight. “I did feel a little bit nauseous, for sure.”\n\nOther passengers on the livestream described the view as “incredible.”\n\n“Unreal, just unreal,” Allen said. “I can’t put it into words.”\n\n“It was an out-of-body experience,” Kitchen said. He described outer space as the “blackest black I’ve ever seen,” adding that it was “breathtaking.” Nield called it “the thrill of a lifetime.”\n\n“Pictures don’t do it justice,” he added.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nBusiness activity in space — largely led by SpaceX — is booming. From building cheaper rockets and designing new uses for satellites to imagining futuristic space hotels, the industry has attracted record levels of investment, according to data collected by analytics firm Space Capital.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin made headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nStrahan wrote a message for the passengers on Thursday’s flight that was read to them by ground control: “This is the best ride you will ever have, but it’s way too short.”\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests — who thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nBlue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos’ flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company’s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says it’s undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nSpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three of his chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And next week, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.\n\nBlue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called the New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for the New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines.Its new rocket with the US-made BE-4 engines is scheduled to make its debut this year.\n\nBlue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/tech/blue-origin-launch-passengers-scn/index.html", "title": "Who's flying on Thursday's Blue Origin space launch? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPete Davidson was initially slated to be the next headline-grabbing name to take flight aboard the suborbital space tourism rocket developed by Jeff Bezos’ company, Blue Origin, after the commercial space company launched several other famous faces on its previous flights.\n\nBut the comedian abruptly dropped out of the mission after a schedule change pushed the flight back by a week. His seat was given to longtime company employee Gary Lai, the chief architect of the very rocket he’ll fly on. Lai will be joined by five paying customers who had the means to dish out an undisclosed sum for one of the coveted crew capsule seats.\n\nLiftoff of the New Shepard launch vehicle had been scheduled for Tuesday morning, but the company said that it’s expecting rough winds at its facilities near Van Horn, Texas at that time. Blue Origin is now targeting Thursday at 8:30 am CT. Those interested in catching the action — which is expected to look much like Blue Origin’s three earlier suborbital jaunts — can tune into Blue Origin’s webcast Thursday morning.\n\nA Blue Origin New Shepard rocket launches on December 11, 2021, in West Texas near Van Horn. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe flight will be brief. It’s an approximately 10-minute up-and-down excursion that will kick off with the rocket firing up its engines and reaching more than three times the speed of sound as it propels the crew’s capsule to more than 60 miles above the Earth’s surface. The passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness and sweeping views of the planet below, before gravity drags them back to Earth and the capsule deploys parachutes to ensure a gentle landing near the launch site.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear how much the paying customers on this mission forked over, and Blue Origin has not disclosed a fixed ticket price. But we do know at least one would-be passenger won an auction for a ticket to fly alongside Bezos last year for a whopping $28 million. (That passenger, however, did not end up flying on Bezos’ flight.) We also know another player in the suborbital space tourism game, Virgin Galactic, is selling its seats for $450,000 a piece. Whether the passengers paid a few hundred thousand bucks or a few million, it’s safe to say that these missions won’t be affordable for the average consumer anytime soon.\n\nThe interior of a Blue Origin capsule on display on December 11, 2021, in Van Horn, Texas. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHere is a look at some of the next space tourists set to launch on Blue Origin’s mission on Thursday.\n\nGary Lai\n\nLai, the only non-paying passenger on Thursday’s suborbital flight, was among the first 20 employees at Blue Origin after joining the company in 2004.\n\nHe’s been credited as the “architect of the New Shepard system,” and holds multiple patents related to the launch vehicle, according to a statement from Blue Origin. During his time as an undergraduate at Cornell University, Lai studied under theprolificlate astronomer Carl Sagan.\n\nLai will be the second Asian-American passenger to voyage to the edge of space on a suborbital spaceflight, after Virgin Galactic employee and Indian-American aeronautical engineer Sirisha Bandla joined Richard Branson on his spaceflight last year. The industry is running abruptly into societal issues for largely being accessible to the white, male and wealthy, so far.\n\nMarty Allen\n\nMarty Allen is an angel investor and former chief executive of a party supply store and a closet design company.\n\nThe Pennsylvania native now lives in California. In an interview with Philadelphia-based local news station WPVI-TV, Allen said that visiting space has been a dream of his since childhood.\n\n“I’ve loved aviation from the time I was a kid,” he said. “I used to build rockets and play with them as a kid. I always dreamed about space.”\n\nAllen added that each passenger was given a small bag to take aboard the suborbital trip, and revealed that he is packing his with an American flag that is 60 feet by 10 feet to bring along on the journey.\n\n“I’m going to take it up with me, and when I come back home, I’m going to erect a really big flagpole on my property and fly that flag,” Allen told the local news outlet.\n\nJim Kitchen\n\nJim Kitchen is an entrepreneur and faculty member of the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School, where he teaches classes on how to start “social entrepreneurial ventures and raise funding,”according to his university bio.\n\nAn avid traveler who documents his trips on Instagram, Kitchen has visited all 193 U.N. member countries. But like the other passengers, he says visiting space has been a longtime dream.\n\n“One of my earliest childhood memories was sitting in my mom’s lap at the beach in Florida and watching an Apollo mission launch, just looking up and seeing that rocket go up to space,” Kitchen said in an interview with a UNC business school publication.\n\nWhile he’s already seen much of Earth from down below, he said he’s really excited about viewing the planet from above.\n\n“Given everything that’s going on right now in the world, seeing this borderless planet from space is really important to me,” Kitchen said.\n\nGeorge Nield\n\nGeorge Nield is the president and founder of Commercial Space Technologies, acompany that aims to promote and facilitate commercial space activities. He previously worked as an associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation, according to Blue Origin, where he was responsible for licensing and regulating commercial launch activities.\n\nWhile he spent much of his career on the regulatory side of the budding space tourism sector, Nield expressed excitement about finally being able to experience the “magic” of the journey firsthand.\n\n“Some folks have asked me why I would want to go on a suborbital spaceflight,” he wrote in a March 14 tweet. “Here’s my answer: To see black sky and the curvature of the Earth, and to experience the ‘magic’ of weightlessness.”\n\nSharon Hagle\n\nSharon Hagle will be lifting off alongside her husband, Marc Hagle, on Thursday’s flight – making them the first married couple to jointly fly on a commercial spaceflight.\n\nShe is the founder of SpaceKids Global, a nonprofit that works to encourage students – and especially young girls – to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (so-called STEAM programs). The organization hosts national essay competitionsand organizes speaking engagements at schools aimed to inspire the the next generation to pursue careers in the space industry.\n\nSharon Haglehas the goal of experiencing spaceflight via all three companies currently operating in the arena: Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, per per her SpaceKids Global bio.\n\nMarc Hagle\n\nMarc Hagle is the chief executive of a residential and commercial property development firm based in the Orlando, Florida area.\n\nSome fifteen years ago, the Hagles reserved tickets to fly on a future Virgin Galactic flight after they celebrated a wedding anniversary by experiencing near-weightlessness aboard a Zero Gravity Corp. jet, he told his local newspaper Florida Today.\n\nNow that the couple’s longtime dream of experiencing spaceflight are coming into fruition, Marc Hagle told Florida Today, “I can’t even begin to tell you how excited we are.”\n\n“We’re very honored to be able to do it,” he added. “And we’re having a lot of fun with it.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke Jackie Wattles", "Catherine Thorbecke", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/tech/pete-davidson-blue-origin-space-scn/index.html", "title": "Blue Origin announces replacement for Pete Davidson on next ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJeff Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, said it will replace Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson with a long-time employee on the company’s next supersonic jaunt to the edge of space.\n\nThe company announced Monday it will replace Davidson with its chief architect of its suborbital rocket, Gary Lai.\n\nDavidson, who has become a pillar of entertainment intrigue amid his relationship with Kim Kardashian and feud with Kanye West, had been slated to fly as an invited guest alongside five paying customers aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. But when Blue Origin announced last week that it had to delay that flight — from March 23 to March 29 — for additional ground tests on the rocket, the company also announced Davidson could no longer join the mission.\n\nLai, who has been with Blue origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket’s design, will fly alongside five previously announced paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests — which thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nThe crew change-up with Lai and Davidson isn’t the first. Last year, the company held an auction for one ticket to fly alongside Bezos, and the as-yet-unnamed winner of that auction agreed to shell out a staggering $28 million for the seat. But then the winner opted out, choosing to fly on a later mission, and a runner-up in the auction, a Dutch investor, passed the ticket on to his 18-year-old son, Oliver Daemen.\n\nBefore this month’s flight, the Blue Origin passengers will spend a few days training at Blue Origin’s facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they’ll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule’s windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth.\n\nAs the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window.\n\nAs gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense G-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert.\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard lifts off from the launch pad carrying 90-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner and three other civilians on October 13, 2021 near Van Horn, Texas.

She says she was denied a lawyer and that the court didn’t obtain a police complaint before her trial began, the Daily Mirror reported.\n\nTiyrab is appealing the decision at Sudan’s High Court. Historically, the majority of stoning sentences – “which are predominantly against women” – are overturned, said The Guardian. This was the case in 2013, the last time a woman was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery in Sudan.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It is an execution method rooted in “ancient Greece and in Judeo-Christian religious texts” but has “no explicit mention in the Quran”, according to NBC News.\n\nIt is relatively rare but still used in some Muslim parts of the world today, where it is considered a form of community justice for punishing those accused of crimes like adultery, prostitution, murder and blasphemy.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThose sentenced to stoning – or “lapidation” – under Islamic law are “buried in a hole and covered with soil”, said NBC. A selected group then throws rocks and sticks at the accused and those “able to escape the hole during stoning can be freed”. The size of the stones is specified by sharia law, added the broadcaster, “to ensure the execution does not take too long or occur too quickly”.\n\nWhere is stoning practised?\n\nIran has the world’s highest rate of execution by stoning and the Middle Eastern country regularly makes headlines for its employment of the practice, which came into force after the 1979 revolution. The Library of Congress believes that around 150 people were stoned to death in Iran between 1980 and 2009, although the reported numbers are probably lower than the actual figures.\n\nIn May, The Sun obtained classified records which revealed that Iran had sentenced 51 people to death by stoning for adultery, including 23 women.\n\nIran’s penal code specifically lays out that “the size of the stone used in stoning shall not be too large to kill the convict by one or two throws and at the same time shall not be too small to be called a stone”, added the paper.\n\nStoning has also made a resurgence in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Earlier this year, reports suggested that a man and a woman had been stoned to death at a sharia court for having sexual relations outside of marriage.\n\nIn 2015, disturbing footage of a 19-year-old woman being stoned to death in a Taliban-controlled village went viral. The woman “had been forced to marry against her will” and had fled with another man before being caught and sentenced to stoning for adultery, said CNN.\n\nStoning is used in several northern states in Nigeria “to punish residents for crimes ranging from adultery to blasphemy”, said Reuters. Last month, an Islamic sharia court in Bauchi sentenced three men to death by stoning after charging them with engaging in homosexuality.\n\nSeveral women in Nigeria have been sentenced to death by stoning but been let off, including Hajara Ibrahim, who was just 18 when she was convicted of adultery and sentenced to stoning in 2004. Her lawyer had argued that the ruling “was invalid because Hajara had not consummated her marriage before sleeping with her boyfriend and conceiving a child”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nIn recent years, members of Somalia’s Islamist group al-Shabaab have sought to bring back stoning as a punishment for violating sharia law. In 2017, a 30-year-old mother of eight was publicly stoned to death for cheating on her husband.\n\n“Her legal husband brought the case to the court. She admitted she illegally married a second husband,” al-Shabaab’s governor for Somalia’s Jubba regions in the south told Reuters. “According to the Islamic sharia she was publicly stoned to death this afternoon.”\n\nIn 2019, five years after the country introduced sharia law, Brunei introduced strict new Islamic laws which made anal sex and adultery offences punishable by stoning to death.\n\nThe move “sparked international condemnation”, said the BBC. George Clooney, Ellen DeGeneres and other A-listers called for a boycott of the luxury hotels owned by the Brunei Investment Agency in response.\n\nAccording to a report by Human Rights Without Frontiers International in 2012, several women have been sentenced to death by stoning in Pakistan, but none of the stonings have actually been carried out. The report added that cases of extrajudicial stoning have occurred “most commonly in areas under Taliban influence or rule on the border of Afghanistan”.\n\nEarlier this year a mentally ill man was stoned to death by “an angry mob” in Punjab province after it was alleged that the victim had “burned some pages of the Qur’an”, said The Guardian.\n\nStoning has also occurred in Mali, where a couple who had sex outside marriage were stoned to death in 2012, and the United Arab Emirates, where several women have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery.\n\nIt is a legal punishment in Qatar and Yemen, although it is believed that such sentences haven’t actually been used there.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Brigid Kennedy", "Gabriel Power"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/09/coronavirus-kentucky-can-beshear-block-religious-gatherings/2972356001/", "title": "Coronavirus in Kentucky: Can Beshear block religious gatherings?", "text": "A Hopkins County church revival became the flash point of a coronavirus outbreak that has since spread across Kentucky, linked to 30 positive cases of COVID-19 and three deaths.\n\nA Louisville-area preacher has received a state-backed order from the Bullitt County Health Department to cease in-person gatherings at Maryville Baptist Church effective \"immediately\" after he continues to defy a state ban on mass gatherings.\n\nAnd another Louisville pastor has teamed up with national lawyers to declare Mayor Greg Fischer's order against drive-in Easter services a violation of constitutional rights.\n\nFaith-based gatherings have been a point of contention in Kentucky since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn his daily briefings to the Commonwealth, Gov. Andy Beshear has begged and pleaded for faith leaders to \"do the right thing.\" He's called out those in the state who are not following the social distancing rules and guidelines implemented in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe governor has expressed repeatedly his concern over people gathering in groups, including in churches.

And his message has been increasingly urgent as Easter Sunday looms.\n\n[This story is being provided for free to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

During a Wednesday press briefing, he said he is working with local officials – but would not say if he would send law enforcement to break up services.\n\nHere's what Fischer has said\n\nFischer said Tuesday that \"with a heavy heart\" he will not allow drive-in religious services during this week of Passover and Easter.\n\n\"This is a big sacrifice for people of faith,\" he said. \"This coronavirus does not care about traditions. It does not care about faith.\"\n\nThis week, Jews will celebrate Passover, which began Wednesday evening, and Christians are celebrating Holy Week.\n\nBut communal Seder meals, church celebrations and group Easter egg hunts can't happen, Fischer said, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect and kill Kentuckians.\n\n\"I can't think really of a more painful irony than good people dying because they contracted a virus from a loved one of theirs over a day of Easter to celebrate life and rebirth,\" Fischer said.\n\nHe said Louisville is in a different position than most other places in the state, given it is densely populated as an urban center.\n\n\"It's not really practical or safe to accommodate drive-up services taking place in our community,\" he said.\n\nWill they use law enforcement to break up services?\n\nThat's unclear.\n\nWhen asked about how the city will enforce Fischer's new ban on drive-in religious services, spokeswoman Jean Porter said, \"This is not a law enforcement matter, it’s a community matter.\"\n\n\"The mayor has tried to be very clear that these kind of services – along with Easter parties and parades – put everyone at risk and should not happen,\" Porter told the Courier Journal on Wednesday. \"Louisville Metro Police have been proactive about reaching out to those we’ve heard about, and discouraging organizers from proceeding. We also have urged anyone who sees violations from our social distancing guidance to reach out to 311. In some cases, police may go out, especially if there are other violations happening, like fighting or loud noise. Bottom line is we are calling for people to do the right thing, and protect themselves and others by staying home.\"\n\nHow many churches are not following the rules?\n\nDuring his Wednesday press briefing, Beshear said his administration has identified \"around 17 or less churches or other entities\" that may not be doing so. He said those numbers come from either the state receiving reports of groups holding services or groups that are claiming to do so. For a commonwealth with 120 counties, 4.5 million residents and myriad places of worship, Beshear said, that means \"just about everybody is doing the right thing.\"\n\nWhat about drive-in services?\n\nEarlier this week, Beshear gave these rules for churches to follow if they intend to hold drive-up services for Easter or any other Sunday:\n\nOne family per car\n\nCars must be 6 feet apart\n\nYou cannot get out of the car\n\nYou cannot pass things in and out of cars\n\nThe best way to celebrate Easter is with a virtual service, Beshear said. And remember Fischer says he is banning them in Louisville.\n\nA change to tradition:Louisville synagogues prepare to celebrate a sacred holiday virtually\n\nAre religious gatherings protected?\n\nThough several states have exempted religious services from restrictions on gatherings aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, Kentucky’s order makes no distinction among “faith-based” events, ballgames or concerts. All are prohibited.\n\nSome faith leaders have said this prohibition tramples rights protected by the First Amendment and Kentucky’s Constitution. At issue is whether the freedom to practice one's religion conflicts with the greater good in a medical emergency.\n\n\"The freedom to attend worship services is one of our most important rights, as guaranteed by the United States Constitution,\" said Samuel Crankshaw from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky.\n\nThe Constitution does grant government officials the ability to use emergency powers, the ACLU said. And in this instance, government officials may temporarily limit these types of gatherings due to the extraordinary circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"However, any restrictions must be grounded in the scientific and fact-based recommendations of public health experts,\" Crankshaw said in email to The Courier Journal. \"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, these experts agree that large gatherings pose an immediate and grave risk to public health. These recommendations, however, should undergo constant and intense scrutiny to ensure they remain relevant and that there are no other, less restrictive, measures available.\"\n\nThe states that have exempted religious gatherings from being restricted include Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. California has deemed “faith-based services that are provided through streaming or other technology” to be essential, but not in-person gatherings.\n\nOpinion:'God, what would you have us do?' Coronavirus crisis shows the church must change\n\nHave pastors been arrested?\n\nA Louisiana pastor named Tony Spell was arrested in late March and charged with six misdemeanors for violating an executive order by Gov. John Bel Edwards against gatherings of more than 50 people.\n\nFlorida megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne was also arrested in March for hosting Sunday services at his church, The River at Tampa Bay, and charged with misdemeanor counts of unlawful assembly and violating public health rules.\n\nWhat are pastors saying?\n\nMany faith leaders, including those only hosting online services and the few still fighting to meet in person, have said they feel that spiritual services are \"essential\" in the pandemic.\n\nRev. Jack Roberts, the pastor of Maryville Baptist Church who was \"not interested in trying to defy the government,\" told The Courier Journal that he received a state-backed order Tuesday to stop holding services at his church in north Bullitt County.\n\nHe said he is in contact with a national Christian organization that has several constitutional attorneys \"that are in the process shortly of filing a lawsuit\" against the Beshear administration. He declined to name the organization.\n\nMore:Can the government force you to quarantine if you're infected with coronavirus?\n\nChuck Salvo, the pastor of On Fire Christian Church off New Cut Road who said in a Facebook Live video on Tuesday evening that Fischer's order is \"total religious discrimination,\" has teamed up with religious liberty lawyers to pen a letter to Mayor Fischer.\n\nSalvo has been hosting drive-in services at the church, where congregants are now staying in their cars, parked six feet apart and are only allowed to roll their windows halfway down.\n\nIn the letter sent to Fischer Thursday, lawyers from the First Liberty Institute said that the mayor's directives to ban drive-in services target religious exercise and go against federal and Kentucky state law, including the Kentucky’s Religious Freedom Act.\n\n\"Your directive prohibits the physical gathering of believers that is central to the Easter celebration, effectively limiting religious services by houses of worship to video or teleconferencing only but does not force the same restriction on other entities or activities,\" the letter states to Fischer. \"As a result, it uniquely handicaps churches from implementing the social distancing guidelines provided by the CDC and approved by Governor Beshear.\"\n\nThe letter also pointed to drive-through restaurants and stores like Wal-Mart as examples of places with \"less oversight.\"\n\n\"The prohibition is unlawful because it treats houses of worship less favorably than similarly situated entities.\"\n\nSavannah Eadens is a Culture & Diversity reporter for the Courier Journal.

Evers seeks to bar firearms from RNC soft perimeter\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has requested that the decision to allow firearms within the soft perimeter of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee be reconsidered \"immediately\" following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, a source with knowledge of the discussion shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would relay the governor's concerns to the Republican National Committee, the source said.\n\nBut the request appears likely to go nowhere.

She said it represents clean water. Another artist created an intricate cardboard bird and another created a painted owl to wear on her head. Simensky Bietila said her own work often addresses clean water and environmental advocacy.\n\nLeccese said she thinks elected officials “made a big mistake” in inviting the RNC to Milwaukee.\n\n“[They] invited a bunch of people here who don’t generally like the population of this city,” she said. “We wanted to create safe places outside of downtown for people to come be in joyful resistance together.”\n\nLeccese said they chose puppets because they tell a great story and encourage people to be involved in politics and demonstrations.\n\n-- Claire Reid\n\nInside a quiet Fiserv Forum, RNC staff and media prepare for busy week\n\nThe inside of Fiserv Forum was a focused and quiet atmosphere a day before the big show.\n\nNational TV networks workers lugged wagons of camera equipment into their media suites. Reporters from smaller outlets found their stations to file stories on the top floor. Volunteers received tours to learn the building's layout and where to direct people. RNC merchandise shops and concession stands were closed Sunday.\n\nThe most activity was on the event floor where banners proclaimed \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT ONCE AGAIN!\" Stairs up to the stage were lined with red lights and balloons waited in nets to be dropped from the ceiling. TV reporters rehearsed their live shots.\n\nDuring a Color Guard rehearsal, five men carrying flags and rifles practiced their procession and presenting of the colors.\n\nSeveral songs played from the sound system periodically, including \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" RNC staff checked sound levels for the various camera crews.\n\n\"Testing mic one,\" someone said. \"Hello, Milwaukee.\"\n\n-- Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nWisconsin pastors pray for Trump’s recovery at Turning Point Action event\n\nSeveral dozen people gathered at Zeidler Union Square Sunday afternoon for a prayer vigil for former President Donald Trump following his attempted assassination on Saturday.\n\nThe gathering was hosted by conservative group Turing Point Action.\n\nPeople were clad in “Make America Great Again” hats, held American flags and signed a “get well soon” sign for the former president.\n\nMilwaukee resident Bryan Dudley, 51, said he attended to show his support for Trump.\n\n“It was a tragedy what happened yesterday to begin with, shouldn't ever happen… just because you don't like somebody doesn't mean you need to take them out,” Dudley said.\n\nDudley said while he understands tensions will be high in Milwaukee this week during the Republican National Convention he is still looking forward to a positive event.\n\nA handful of pastors from across Wisconsin, including Milwaukee pastor Marty Calderon, prayed for Trump’s recovery and thanked God for saving his life.\n\nAt times, they encouraged praying for the safety of President Joe Biden and elected officials in Congress, whether Republican or Democratic.\n\n“I was asked to come pray for our nation, for our country … I don’t care if you’re Democrat, Republican, I don’t care who you believe in,” Calderon told the Journal Sentinel.\n\n“I was very shocked,” Calderon said of the assassination attempt.\n\nCalderon added he’s avoiding the downtown next week during the RNC despite being asked to come as a guest. Instead, he’ll be praying.\n\n“I expect a lot of chaos, to a point, on both ends. It’s not just going to be one particular group, it’s just going to be very chaotic down here.”\n\n- Jessica Rodriguez and Hope Karnopp\n\nInterfaith leaders rally hundreds to reject Christian nationalism\n\nOver 500 people have filled the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s performing arts center for an interfaith “rally for democracy” this afternoon in opposition to the Republican National Convention and in rejection of Christian nationalism.\n\nCivil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton had been scheduled to speak at the rally but canceled after being asked to offer eulogy for D'Vontaye Mitchell, who died after being held down by security guards outside a Milwaukee hotel June 30.\n\nThe event at the Zelazo Center was organized by Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope (MICAH), a social justice and interfaith organization representing 42 congregations.\n\nAt a press conference before the 2 p.m. rally, MICAH President Richard Shaw, a pastor at St. Matthew CME Church, said the event was necessary to show the world that “there's a group of religious leaders who do not stand for white Christian nationalism.”\n\n“It's necessary because the group who's meeting here in Milwaukee, they pushed an ideology that separates us,” Shaw said. “But we want to show that regardless of our race, regardless of our religion, regardless of our origin, our sexual origin, our gender, that we come together.”\n\nJanan Najeeb, who serves as director of the Milwaukee Muslim Women’s Coalition and is the first non-Christian chair of the MICAH’s religious leaders caucus, said the caucus’ work is to build “beloved community that believes in the intrinsic worth of all people.”\n\n“MICAH has a 36 year history of welcoming people of various faiths and spiritualities, people who believe in the dignity of every human being and commit to the justice work needed to make that happen,” Najeeb said at the event.\n\nOrganizers called Christian nationalism – a movement that argues the government should be based on Christian values – an urgent threat to democracy.\n\nDennis Jacobson, a founding pastor of MICAH, cited surveys by the Public Religion Research Institute that found about 30% of Americans qualified as Christian nationalism adherents or sympathizers.\n\n“To privilege Christianity would destroy our multicultural democracy and kill the dream of a beloved community for which so many people are striving,” Jacobson said. “If white Christian nationalism prevails, you may soon know what it's like to live in an authoritarian society.\"\n\nThe rally, scheduled to run until 6 p.m., features a range of local and national speakers who will discuss Christian nationalism, its “threat to democracy,” and how attendees can work together to reject it.\n\n-- Rory Linnane\n\nPeople waiting in airport observation lot told to leave\n\nAbout two dozen cars were waiting in the plane observation lot at the Milwaukee International Airport. Some were waiting to see Trump’s plane land. Around 2:30 p.m., they were told to leave by Milwaukee County Sheriff’s department officers to prepare for Trump’s arrival at Signature Flight Support.\n\nAll the cars left. Officers told media and people watching from the cars that the observation lot would be closing and no one would be allowed to park along the observation lot fence on Layton Avenue.\n\nAndrew G. of Milwaukee was waiting to see Trump’s plane land and flying a large American flag out of his sun roof. He said he had already purchased the flag today and wanted to come out and see Trump’s plane after last night’s shooting.\n\nAndrew called the assassination attempt “absolutely horrible” and said he was “speechless.”\n\n“If convicting Trump as a felon made his poll numbers go up, what do you think this is going to do?” he said.\n\nOthers waiting in the observation lot, such as a couple who was enjoying Leon’s custard before heading out on vacation, were surprised to learn Trump was due to fly in nearby.\n\n-- Claire Reid\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC reconfirmed route with city last night\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC reconfirmed route with city last nightThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route.\n\nOn July 12, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with MPD and the city attorney’s office, though city officials did not confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed their route with the city Saturday night.\n\nAsked if the route would change if the perimeter is adjusted, Flores said “all of the planning from the city has been extremely last-minute, and so we’re pretty used to last-minute changes and we’ll be ready for anything.”\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. tomorrow, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at 12 p.m. The group currently only plans to march on Monday.\n\n-- Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump to leave for Milwaukee shortly\n\nFormer President Trump said he will arrive in Milwaukee Sunday, just hours after he was wounded in an assassination attempt during a rally Saturday in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump on Truth Social Sunday afternoon said he will be leaving for Milwaukee at 3:30 ET as scheduled, despite originally planning to delay his arrival at the Republican National Convention following the shooting.\n\n\"Based on yesterday's terrible events, I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days,\" he wrote, \"but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, President Joe Biden said he asked the Secret Service to \"review all security measures\" for the RNC in Milwaukee.\n\n\"As I said last night, there's no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter,\" Biden said Sunday. \"As assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation.\"\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nBiden says he directed Secret Service to review all security measures for RNC\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave brief remarks from the White House Sunday afternoon, noting he spoke with former President Donald Trump Saturday night.

According to historic accounts, however, Europeans had been visiting New England since at least the late 1400s. The Basques, English and French had a thriving fishing industry off the coast of Maine and New England. The first documented European to make contact with either the Narragansetts or the Wampanoags in Southern New England was Italian explorer Giovanni de Verrazano, who, in 1524, while sailing for the French, traveled up Narragansett Bay and traded with the Native people he found there.\n\nIn fact, several Native Americans in the area spoke English by the time the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, picked up either through trading encounters or by previously being taken into slavery by the English but either escaping or being returned to the area. Samoset, Tisquantum, or “Squanto,” and Epenow, all spoke English and played important roles in burgeoning relations between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags, as detailed by historian and author David Silverman in his book, \"This Land Is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony, and the Troubled History of Thanksgiving.\"\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims came to the New World seeking religious freedom.\n\nThe group we most often associate with the Pilgrims — the Puritan congregation that separated from the Church of England — did, at least partially, come to America looking for a place where they could practice their religion without persecution. Puritans made up less than half of the more than 100 people who crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower and settled what would eventually become Plymouth, as detailed in William Bradford's \"Of Plimouth Plantation.\"\n\nThe main reason they came to America was to maintain their English culture and to make money. After splitting off from the Church of England near the turn of the 17th century, the congregation fled to Holland, which allowed for more religious freedom. But they found it difficult to find jobs to support themselves,.......... and were worried their children were being too influenced by Dutch culture and morals.\n\nThey secured a charter from The London Company to start a colony in America — England’s second, after Jamestown in Virginia — and began gathering a group of people to travel with them, mainly servants, explorers and sailors. It’s also worth noting that, while the Pilgrims wanted the freedom to practice their religion, that freedom did not extend to anyone else. One of their main goals was to convert the Native people to Christianity.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims intended to settle in Patuxet/Plymouth or, alternately, the Pilgrims meant to settle in Virginia but they were blown off course.\n\nWhile the story of the first Thanksgiving usually starts with the Pilgrims completing their oceanic crossing by stepping off the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock (another myth!) the area then known as Patuxet and later christened Plymouth was actually the Pilgrims’ second landing. On Nov. 11, 1620, the voyagers dropped anchor on the tip of Cape Cod and came ashore at what is now Provincetown.\n\nThey were driven off about a month later, due to intimidation by Nauset tribesmen, who did not take kindly to the new European arrivals. The Pilgrims got back on the ship and sailed farther into Cape Cod Bay to settle at the site of the relatively abandoned Wampanoag village of Patuxet in December. Most of the Pilgrims spent the rest of the winter living on the Mayflower until enough buildings were built and they could settle the area in earnest in 1621.\n\nAlternatively, there is an idea that the Pilgrims were originally meant to settle in Virginia, near England’s first colony, Jamestown. While Virginia was considered by the Pilgrims as a destination, the charter granted to them by The London Company covered the area north of Virginia, named New England. As Bradford writes, their destination was meant to be the area around the mouth of the Hudson River, where Dutch traders had tapped into the lucrative fur trade. The Pilgrim's goal was to claim that area, and the fur trade, for England.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims sighted Cape Cod, they realized they’d been blown off course and tried to head south for the Hudson River, only to encounter dangerously rocky shoals causing them to turn back. Since Cape Cod technically was part of New England, they decided to stay there.\n\nMyth: The Pilgrims and Wampanoags came together in November 1621 for a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack with this one, and not just because it forms the basis of our country’s Thanksgiving Day story.\n\nFirst, while the Puritans did have “days of Thanksgiving” they were literally the opposite of a big, fun, family feast. They were usually days of fasting and prayer that maybe would be broken with a larger meal.\n\nEdward Winslow, in his writing about the first few years in Plymouth titled “Mourt’s Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims in Plymouth,” does mention a celebration marking the settlement’s first successful harvest, probably held around October 1621. Given the context, it certainly wasn’t a huge deal but it would later become one in modern America.\n\nAccording to Winslow, despite the fact that the Wampanoags had allowed the Pilgrims to live on their land, provided them with aid and taught them how to successfully grow native crops, the Wampanoags were not invited to this celebration. They arrived only after the Pilgrims started shooting their guns into the air. Believing themselves to be under attack, the Wampanoags head sachem, Massasoit, showed up at the settlement with about 90 warriors expecting war. Instead, they found a celebration and they decided to stay, with their hunters bringing in five deer as a contribution. Rather than a happy celebration of camaraderie and partnership, the feast that would serve as the basis of the traditional Thanksgiving myth was actually quite a tense affair, fraught with political implications.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/955524/how-war-ukraine-started-and-how-will-end", "title": "How might the Ukraine war end? | The Week", "text": "Donald Trump has pledged to end Russia's war in Ukraine within days of taking office. Here's how it might be done.\n\nWhat has Trump promised?\n\nTo end the war immediately. \"I'll have that done in 24 hours,\" he said last year. The US has spent more than $120bn in aid to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022, making it by some distance the largest donor. However, domestic support for arming Ukraine appears to have waned, particularly among Republicans, and isolationism is prevalent in the Maga movement. \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,\" said Trump's VP-elect J.D. Vance in 2022; this year he said that he was \"opposed to virtually any proposal for the United States to continue funding this war\". After the election, Donald Trump Jr reposted a meme warning President Zelenskyy: \"You're 38 days from losing your allowance.\" Trump's own position, though, has been fluid. He has presented no plan, and has not said how he would bridge the gap between apparently irreconcilable Russian and Ukrainian positions.\n\nWhat is the Russian position?\n\nIn June, Vladimir Putin outlined his negotiating stance. To end the war, Ukraine must withdraw forces from four Ukrainian provinces that Russia has invaded and claims as its own territory: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. (Currently, Russia occupies about 70% of these, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014 – in total, about 20% of Ukraine's land.) In addition, Ukraine must give up its plans to join Nato; reduce the size of its military; and \"denazify\" its leadership (presumably code for removing the likes of Zelensky). Finally, all international sanctions on Russia must be lifted. However, Russia, though dominant at this stage in the war, is suffering massive casualties and its economy seems precarious. Putin has said he will talk to Trump. Russian officials have said they would consider freezing the conflict on its current lines, with \"room for negotiation over the precise carve-up\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine should be given clear security guarantees, in the form of Nato membership or similar. In addition, Russian war crimes against Ukraine should be prosecuted; compensation paid out; and abducted Ukrainian children returned. However, since the failure of last year's southern offensive, it has become clear that, as Zelensky put it last week, \"our army lacks the strength\" to expel the Russians. \"We do have to find diplomatic solutions,\" he said.\n\nHow might Trump reach a deal?\n\nTrump is reported to be far from settled on a single approach. But he has appointed Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general, as his envoy to Ukraine and Russia; and Kellogg published a paper in April outlining his plan. His proposal is that the US would continue to supply weapons to the Ukrainians, but only on the condition that they join peace talks. At the same time, Trump would warn Russia that if it rejected negotiations, US aid to Ukraine would be increased. The front lines would be frozen. Ukraine would not be asked to formally cede territory; but it would agree to try to recover it only through diplomatic means. Ukraine's Nato application would also be frozen. The US and its allies would only lift sanctions and normalise ties with Russia if it signs a deal \"acceptable to Ukraine\".\n\nCould it work?\n\nMany Kremlin-watchers doubt that Putin has any desire to negotiate or freeze the conflict. One well-connected oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, said that if Kellogg came to Russia with his plan, \"We would tell him to go to hell\". Even if the Kremlin does engage, the fear is that the US has far more leverage over Ukraine than over Russia, because stopping military aid would be disastrous for the Ukrainians. So Trump might only be able to push for a peace unfavourable to Ukraine. However, Kurt Volker, his former Ukraine envoy, hopes that Trump will take a hard line: that if Putin refuses to end the war, Trump will let Ukraine borrow as much money and buy as many weapons as it needs. Kyiv, too, is being asked to make painful compromises: giving up not just land but also citizens to Russia's illegal occupation. And a deal might only give Russia time to regroup before it attacks again. So Ukraine wants cast-iron security guarantees.\n\nHow could Ukraine's security be guaranteed?\n\nUkraine is demanding to be brought into Nato. But neither Trump nor other Nato nations want this; and Putin would do everything in his power to block it. One other possibility is for a demilitarised zone, preserved by peacekeeping troops. It has been reported that Trump would call on EU and British troops to enforce a buffer zone between the Russian and Ukrainian armies. This would be expensive and possibly dangerous for those nations, and Russia might well be implacably opposed. Alternatively, some have proposed the \"Israel model\": Ukraine remains formally outside Nato but is plentifully supplied with weapons and diplomatic support by the US and the West.\n\nIs peace possible?\n\nThis depends on a series of complex interlocking issues: essentially, the tolerance of both sides for continued fighting, and the extent of Western support. The two did come close to reaching a deal before, in Istanbul, weeks after the war began. It was proposed then that Ukraine would give up its Nato ambitions and commit to neutrality, but would have security guarantees from Western nations. The talks fell apart, for reasons that are disputed, with key issues still undecided. Negotiations under Trump's auspices would be \"a trip to the casino\" for Ukraine, one member of its security forces told The Guardian. \"But by now everyone is exhausted, and some people are willing to make risky bets.\"\n\nWho will lose first?\n\nUkraine's weaknesses are clear: it is outmanned and outgunned, and facing a renewed onslaught on its eastern front despite the massive losses it has inflicted on the invading Russians. Its energy grid is pulverised daily. President Zelensky is unwilling to mobilise more troops by lowering the age for military service from 25 to 18, though the US urged him to do so last month.\n\nBut the pressures on Russia are considerable, too. Casualty figures are hard to verify, but Ukraine estimates that 198,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and 550,000 more wounded (compared to 43,000 Ukrainian dead and 370,000 wounded). Although there is practically no internal opposition to Putin, the war is not popular: independent polling suggests 49% of Russians support withdrawing troops even if it means not achieving stated military goals. Perhaps the most pressing issue, though, is the economy. The official inflation rate has reached 8.5%, even though the central bank has raised its main interest rate to 21%. Prices of staples are going up by more than 20% per year. The government is expected to raise rates again this month, and is spending its savings. \"None of this is about to bring the economy to its knees,\" said The Economist, \"but neither is it sustainable indefinitely.\"", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Elliott Goat", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/23/hajj-deaths-mecca-pilgrimage/74186340007/", "title": "'Only by God's mercy that I survived': Hajj became a death march for ...", "text": "The annual Muslim pilgrimage to the sacred city of Mecca that wrapped up last week became a death march for over 1,300 Hajj participants who died in temperatures that climbed above 124 degrees.\n\nSaudi Arabia's health minister Fahad Al-Jalajel, who on Sunday announced a death total of 1,301, blamed the fatalities on pilgrims \"walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort.\"\n\nThe 5-6 day odyssey of hiking and prayer drew almost 2 million pilgrims from around the world.

What is it? Muslim month of fasting ...", "text": "Muslims across the world are preparing for a month of fasting, spirituality and reflection this Ramadan.\n\nEach year millions of Muslims will begin fasting from sunrise to sunset and engaging in activities that challenge their self-restraint and bring them closer to God.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated on different dates each year. Every year, the holiday starts approximately 11 days before it did the previous year. The exact date always depends on the sighting of the crescent moon. This year the moon was sighted on the night of Sunday, March 10, and fasting began on Monday, March 11.\n\nFasting can last for 29 or 30 days, depending on when the moon signifying the start of the next month is spotted.\n\nWhat is Ramadan?\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic or Hijri, calendar. Muslims believe that it was during this month that God revealed the Quran to Prophet Muhammad.\n\nTyler Mallari, a spokesperson with the Zakat Foundation told USA TODAY that Ramadan \"is a time for Muslims to come together, focus on their spiritual and personal development and spend time giving charity and gathering with their community for prayers and events.\"\n\nWhen is Ramadan?Muslim holy month and Eid al-Fitr dates to know for 2024\n\nWhy do Muslims fast?\n\nMuslims who have reached puberty and who are physically capable will fast from sunrise to sunset. Fasting not only means abstaining from food and drink, but also from sexual relations, and ill behavior. Those who are sick, or traveling are exempt from fasting.\n\n\"The idea is to cultivate awareness of God. Taqwa in Arabic,\" Imam Ebad Rahman, Religious Life Associate for Muslim Life at Columbia University told USA TODAY.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims may engage with the Quran more, with some even challenging themselves to complete reading the religious text in its entirety, Mallari said.\n\nRahman said Muslims will also reflect on the meaning of the Quran, engage in extra prayers, and \"also come together as a community by caring for the needy and sharing their wealth, resources and food, especially in feeding folks,\" during the month.\n\nThe idea of \"the nearness of God, that God is always near and that God listens to the supplications and prayers of people is really emphasized\" during this month, meaning that many Muslims will focus on increasing their good deeds.\n\n\"It's considered a period where God will multiply rewards and people who try to be on top of their game, try to be especially considerate and especially devout,\" Rahman said.\n\nFasting during crisis:Biden: 'Very dangerous' not to have a cease-fire in Gaza before Ramadan\n\nThe last ten nights\n\nThe last ten nights of Ramadan are considered to be especially sacred with the holiest night of Ramadan, Laylat Al-Qadr, falling on one of those nights.\n\nIt's not known when Laylat al-Qadr, known as the “Night of Power” will be, but many believe it most likely falls on any of the odd nights in the last ten nights of Ramadan. Good deeds are believed to be significantly multiplied on that night, and Muslims may spend the night in reflection, prayer and doing other good deeds.\n\nAdditionally, the month is also known to be a time when Muslims increase the charity they give.\n\n\"Muslims are encouraged to embody a charitable spirit in Ramadan in order to benefit their local and broader communities alongside their own personal spiritual development. Through their Ramadan charity, Muslims strive to take care of their neighbors and those around the world in need,\" Mallari said.\n\nHow else do Muslims celebrate during Ramadan?\n\nBeyond fasting, the month is also a time when communities come together. Mallari said mosques all across the country will host iftars, meals breaking the fast, for their communities. These events can be attended by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\n\n\"Iftars are away for Muslims to connect with others in their local Muslim community and engender the spirit of sharing,\" Mallari said.\n\nFamilies and friends also host their own iftars, gathering together to break their fasts, enjoy each other's company, and engage in religious activities together.\n\n\"In Muslim families, communities, and societies, there's even more attention to what folks are going to break their fasts with and sometimes there's special cuisines or favorite dishes,\" Rahman said.\n\nRahman said it's a time for coming together and praying together, \"especially for those we know are being deprived and are experiencing injustice and oppression, especially at this moment.\"\n\nWhen does Ramadan end? When is Eid Al-Fitr?\n\nThis year, it's predicted that Ramadan will end on April 9, with the following day being the first day of Eid Al-Fitr. However, like the start of Ramadan, the ending of the month is also contingent on the sighting of the moon.\n\nMuslims end the month of Ramadan with the celebration of Eid Al-Fitr, one of the two celebratory holidays in the Islamic faith. Eid Al-Fitr is a time when Muslims come together in prayer, and also celebrate completing Ramadan.\n\nTraditions vary across the world, but it's not uncommon for families to buy new clothes, get dressed up, gather together, and give presents or money to each other.\n\n\"It's a festive holiday to look forward to,\" Rahman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/11/07/iowa-great-american-state-fair-iowa-state-fairgrounds-donald-trump-kim-reynolds/76110779007/", "title": "Kim Reynolds says Iowa ready to host Trump's Great American State ...", "text": "Gov.

The removal is in response to a color additive petition filed in 2022 by advocates who claim the additive is linked to cancer and behavioral problems in children.\n\nManufacturers who use Red No. 3 in food will have until Jan. 15, 2027, to reformulate their products, while those who use the dye in drugs will have until Jan. 18, 2028, according to the FDA announcement. Food imported in the U.S. will also be required to comply with the new regulations.\n\nHere's what to know about Red No. 3 and its reported effects.\n\nWhat is Red No. 3?\n\nRed No. 3, also known as erythrosine, is a color additive made from petroleum that gives foods and drinks a bright, cherry-red color. According to the FDA announcement, the additive is commonly used in candy, cakes and cupcakes, frozen desserts, frostings and icing, and certain ingested drugs. According to the Environmental Working Group, a U.S.-based nonprofit focusing on environmental and public health issues, more than 3,000 products contain Red No. 3.\n\nRed No. 3 was banned from use in cosmetics in the U.S. in 1990 because of evidence that the dye is carcinogenic at high doses to lab rats. However, it has remained one of nine synthetic dyes approved for use in food products. The eight remaining approved dyes include Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Orange B, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and Citrus Red − all used to give food, drinks and ingested drugs bright colors.\n\nMore:Do food dyes make ADHD worse? Why some studies' findings spur food coloring bans\n\nWhy did the FDA ban Red No. 3?\n\nThe color additive petition filed in 2022 cited two studies that showed cancer in male lab rats when exposed to high levels of Red No. 3. According to the FDA announcement, the way Red No. 3 causes cancer in male lab rats does not occur in humans. And humans are typically exposed to much lower levels of Red No. 3 than lab rats. The announcement said that studies in other animals and humans did not result in these effects.\n\nFederal ban follows one in California\n\nCalifornia became the first state in 2023 to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of four food additives, including Red No. 3.\n\nIn a separate act passed in 2024, California moved to ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes in public school food and drinks by 2027. The bill did not include Red No. 3.\n\nSince, more states have followed with bills targeting the use of food additives, including Illinois and New York.\n\nIn the past decade, bills targeting Red No. 3 and other food dyes have been introduced in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington and West Virginia, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nIs Red No. 3 banned in other countries?\n\nYes.

Controversial food additive used in ...", "text": "A red food dye prevalent in candies, drinks and other products could soon be banned in the United States if federal regulators side with a petition that is under review.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has signaled that it may finally crack down on the use of the additive known as red dye No. 3, an artificial dye that gives a cherry-red coloring to thousands of American products. While the FDA has claimed that red 3, like other additives the agency has approved, can be safe to consume, advocates have long called for its ban amid concerns that the food dye is linked to cancer and behavioral problems in children.\n\nAt a U.S. Senate hearing last week, Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it’s been more than a decade since regulators have evaluated the safety of the synthetic color additive.\n\n“With red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks, we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jones told a health committee Thursday.\n\nMore:Do food dyes make ADHD worse? Why some studies' findings spur food coloring bans\n\nWhat is red dye No. 3? Lawmakers, advocates call for ban\n\nRed No. 3 is a color additive made from petroleum that gives foods and drinks a distinctive bright red coloring.\n\nThe food dye, which is largely banned in the European Union, has for years drawn the ire of advocates, public health groups and lawmakers due to scientific studies linking it to health issues.\n\nRed No. 3 has been linked to hyperactivity in children and has also been found to cause cancer in animals, although there is not enough research linking the additive to cancer in humans.\n\nConsumer Reports, an advocacy and research nonprofit, in 2023 called on the maker of Peeps candies to stop using red No. 3 in its products. Additionally, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety organization, was among 24 groups and scientists that joined Consumer Reports in starting a petition in 2022 calling on the FDA to formally remove red No. 3 from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines.\n\nFollowing last week's senate hearing, Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J., joined a growing list of lawmakers urging the FDA to ban the food dye.\n\n“There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” Pallone said in a statement. “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.\n\nDoes the FDA regulate red dye No. 3?\n\nWhile red No. 3 has been banned from cosmetics in the U.S. since 1990, the dye – one of nine synthetic dyes approved for use in the U.S. – remains in food products.\n\nHowever, the FDA has two regulations for the use of red No. 3 in American products, one for food and one for ingested drugs.\n\nFDA regulations specify the products in which additives like red No. 3 can be used, the maximum amounts allowed and how food dyes should be identified on food labels.\n\nIn 1990, the FDA banned red No. 3 from cosmetics and topical drugs under the Delaney Clause due to evidence that the dye is carcinogenic at high doses to lab rats. However, because the additives have not been found to cause cancer in humans, the FDA has not taken action to ban them from food.\n\nThe FDA has been reviewing that clause under a petition filed in 2022 by a slew of public health groups.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, Trump's health secretary pick, blasts additives\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination for health secretary, has spoken about the potentially harmful impacts of food dyes in American food.\n\nKennedy, who has not specified what he would do to address artificial food dyes if confirmed to the post, has a reputation for being critical of the FDA and modern medicines.\n\nKennedy has also in the past questioned the efficacy of vaccines and the origin of COVID-19. He's also spread unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and he proposed the removal of fluoride from drinking water\n\nAfter California ban, states take action\n\nIn 2023, California became the first state in the nation to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of four food additives commonly found in thousands of products across the United States, including red No. 3.\n\nIn a separate act passed this year, California moved to ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes in public school food and drinks by 2027. The bill did not include red No. 3.\n\nSince then, more states have followed suit with bills of their own targeting the use of food additives, including Illinois and New York.\n\nThe Illinois State Senate in April passed a bill that would ban red No. 3, along with three other chemical additives, sending it next to the state House for consideration.\n\nNew York legislators also introduced a bill in February that would ban red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state.\n\nIn the past decade, bills targeting red No. 3 and other food dyes have been introduced in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit.\n\nFood manufacturers and industry groups have long been critical of such restrictions.\n\nIn a news release responding to the Illinois bill, the National Confectioners Association said \"It’s time to stop pretending that Illinois state legislators have the scientific expertise to make these very important regulatory decisions.\"\n\n\"Usurping FDA’s authority does nothing but create a patchwork of inconsistent requirements that increase food costs, create confusion around food safety, and erode consumer confidence,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Alyssa Goldberg\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

What to know after Skittles lawsuit", "text": "In a lawsuit filed last week, a consumer alleged that Skittles were \"unfit for human consumption\" because the rainbow candy contained a \"known toxin\" – an artificial color additive called titanium dioxide.\n\nIn a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday, Justin Comes, vice president of research and development for Skittles maker Mars Wrigley North America, said the company couldn't comment on pending litigation – but that its use of titanium dioxide and \"all Mars Wrigley ingredients are safe and manufactured in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements established by food safety regulators, including the FDA.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in a wide range of food products and consumer goods – from candy to sunscreen and house paint. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide, specifically as a color additive in food, is safe under some restrictions.\n\nHowever, some experts and food regulators in other countries disagree – pointing to potential, serious health consequences and rising concerns about the additive. Starting August 7, for example, the use of titanium dioxide in food will be banned in the European Union.\n\nHere's what you need to know about titanium dioxide:\n\nCustomer sues Mars:Skittles are 'unsafe' for consumers, lawsuit charges, because they contain 'a known toxin'\n\nWhat is titanium dioxide? Why is it used in food products?\n\nTitanium dioxide, or TiO2, sometimes referred to as E171, is an inorganic, solid substance used in a wide range of consumer goods including cosmetics, paint, plastic and food, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nIn food, titanium dioxide is often used as an artificial color additive. Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at the consumer health nonprofit Environmental Working Group, says titanium dioxide can generally be thought of as a \"paint primer\" – it often goes on a hard-shelled candy like Skittles before the color is added to give it a \"uniform shine.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide \"can also be found in dairy products to make them whiter and brighter … like frosting or cottage cheese,\" Stoiber told USA TODAY, adding that the additive is used in other products – such as food or beverage instant mixes – as an anti-caking agent.\n\nPhthalates on the fast-food menu:Chemicals linked to health problems found at McDonalds, Taco Bell\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in an enormous range of food products, which can feel jarring when looking at some of its other uses.\n\n\"It's sort of ironic, maybe ironic is the wrong word, that the ingredient in paint that makes your kitchen shiny also makes your Hostess cupcakes shiny,\" Environmental Working Group's senior vice president of government affairs Scott Faber added.\n\nIs titanium dioxide dangerous? Has it been linked to any health issues?\n\nWhile the FDA maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide is safe, the European Food Safety Authority and some other experts warn of potential, serious health risks.\n\nMost notably, a European Food Safety Authority safety assessment published in May 2021 pointed to genotoxicity concerns, as suggested by previous research. Genotoxicity is the ability of chemicals to damage genetic information such as DNA, which may lead to cancer.\n\n\"After oral ingestion, the absorption of titanium dioxide particles is low, however they can accumulate in the body,\" Maged Younes, chair of the European Food Safety Authority's expert Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings, said in a May 2021 statement.\n\nCan cancer patients skip post-surgery chemo? New research says some may be able to.\n\nThe authority did not identify a safe amount of titanium dioxide that could be consumed.\n\nMatthew Wright, chair of the authority's working group on titanium dioxide, noted that \"the evidence for general toxic effects was not conclusive,\" but that the panel couldn't rule out genotoxicity entirely. There were also some current data limitations and the assessment \"could not establish a safe level for daily intake of the food additive,\" he stated.\n\nWhat other candies and food contain titanium dioxide?\n\nIt's hard to determine the total amount of food products that have titanium dioxide because federal regulations don't require all producers to list its use on ingredient labels, but the list of foods containing the substance certainly doesn't end with Skittles.\n\nOf the products that include the additive in their labels, Thea Bourianne, senior manager at data consultant Label Insights, told Food Navigator USA in May 2021 that more than 11,000 products in the company's database of U.S. food and beverage products listed titanium dioxide as an ingredient. Non-chocolate candy led those numbers at 32%. Cupcakes and snack cakes made up 14%, followed by cookies at 8%, coated pretzels and trail mix at 7%, baking decorations at 6%, gum and mints at 4% and ice cream at 2%.\n\nFood recalls:Some Jif peanut butter products recalled over salmonella outbreak concerns\n\nIn addition to Skittles, other candies that contain titanium dioxide include Nice! mints, Trolli sour gummies and Ring Pops, according to Environmental Working Group.\n\nOther food products that list titanium dioxide are Lucerne cottage cheese, Beyond Meat's chicken plant-based tenders, Great Value ice cream and Chips Ahoy! cookies.\n\nWhat is the FDA limit for titanium dioxide?\n\nThe FDA's Code of Federal Regulations allows for the legal, regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products, under some restrictions.\n\n\"The FDA continues to allow for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods generally according to the specifications and conditions, including that the quantity of titanium dioxide does not exceed 1% by weight of the food,\" the FDA said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe FDA first approved the use of titanium dioxide in food in 1966, following its 1960 removal (along with the removal of other color additives) from the agency's original \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" list. In 1977, titanium dioxide joined the list of color additives that are exempt from certification, which means \"titanium dioxide\" doesn't have to be listed on the packaging of every product it's used in, Faber noted.\n\n\"There are many uses of titanium dioxide that we don't know about because they were made exempt from being on the package in 1977,\" said Faber, who added that \"nothing much has changed\" since – other than the FDA approving some other uses of the color additive, such as expanding the use of mica-based pearlescent pigments (prepared from titanium dioxide) as color additives in distilled spirits over recent years.\n\nFDA guidelines:Americans are eating too much salt. So the FDA wants food manufacturers to cut back on sodium.\n\nFaber argued there hasn't been enough change in these federal regulations in the decades following the FDA's approval of titanium dioxide – especially as others increasingly point to potential health consequences.\n\n\"What titanium dioxide is really emblematic of ... is the failure of FDA to look back at these old decisions and ask whether its decisions that were made in this case ... 56 years ago (in the 1966 approval) still hold up,\" he said.\n\nIn its statement to USA TODAY, the FDA maintained that, in all post-approvals for food additives, \"our scientists continue to review relevant new information to determine whether there are safety questions and whether the use of such substance is no longer safe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"\n\nWhen asked about the recent Skittles lawsuit, the FDA said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nIs titanium dioxide illegal in other countries?\n\nThough the regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products is legal in the U.S. and Canada, it's banned in some other countries, notably throughout Europe. In May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority announced that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered safe as a food additive.\"\n\nFollowing six months of phasing out the additive, titanium dioxide will be completely banned in the European Union starting August 7. France had previously banned the use of titanium dioxide in food starting in January 2020.\n\nHow can I tell if a product has titanium dioxide in it? How can I avoid the ingredient?\n\nSome food products will include titanium dioxide on their nutrition label.

More states consider food coloring ...", "text": "(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nThey're in nearly all candies and fruit-flavored snacks sold in conventional American grocery stores. They're on the ingredient list of hundreds of thousands of branded food items, from Fruit Loops and Trix Cereal to Gatorade and Skittles. And they'll soon be banned in California public schools.\n\nArtificial food dyes are the target of a growing number of state bills that would crack down on the chemicals in response to scientific studies that found a possible link between them and hyperactivity in children.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed into law a \"first-in-the-nation\" measure barring schools from serving foods containing the chemicals. Beginning on Dec. 31, 2027, when the legislation goes into effect, AB 2316, or the California School Food Safety Act, will keep schools from serving six artificial food dyes that appear up and down the grocery aisle – Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6.\n\n\"Today, we are refusing to accept the status quo, and making it possible for everyone, including school kids, to access nutritious, delicious food without harmful, and often addictive additives,\" Newsom said in a news release on Saturday.\n\nAnd similar legislation is taking off in at least 10 other states. A bill introduced in Pennsylvania's legislature in March seeks to classify the same six additives as \"poisonous and deleterious substances.\"\n\n\"I'm constantly flipping labels over. It takes me four hours to grocery shop. It shouldn't have to,\" Pennsylvania State Rep. Natalie Mihalek, who introduced the bill, told USA TODAY.\n\nMore:Dye in Doritos used in experiment that, like a 'magic trick,' created see-through mice\n\nDo food dyes cause ADHD?\n\nThe California bill was prompted by a 2021 report from the state's Environmental Protection Agency that linked consumption of the dyes with \"hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems.\"\n\n\"There's a strong suggestion that there is a relationship between intake of these materials and changes in behavior... particularly in children that are susceptible, that already have ADHD, or related behaviors,\" said Asa Bradman, a professor and chair of University of California Merced's public health department who worked on the California review. \"Exposure to the dyes seems to exacerbate the symptom.\"\n\nAmerican kids consume artificial dyes more than ever before. Their per-capita use has increased more than five times since 1955, to more than 17 million pounds of dyes certified for use in 2015, according to a report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. Food dye opponents point to a concurrent jump in ADHD diagnoses – from 6.1% in 1997 to 10.2% a decade later, one study found.\n\nBradman said some foods containing the dyes aren't eaten as frequently, like ice cream or candy. But the chemicals have made their way into other products that kids eat and drink daily, like juice and sodas.\n\n\"The reality is these have no nutritional or other benefits. They're totally aesthetic,\" Bradman said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said in a written statement to USA TODAY that it has \"reviewed the research on the effects of color additives on children’s behavior including the literature review cited by the Bill. The totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives, but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\"\n\nScientists can't say for certain that there is a proven link. According to Bradman and the report, some children were likely to be more affected than others.\n\nAlthough more studies are needed to produce a definitive answer, \"the state of the science really shows that, yes, there probably is some kind of link or effect,\" said Sarah Karalunas, an associate professor at Purdue University's department of psychological sciences.\n\n\"The better the study is, the larger the effect,\" she said, but even in well-controlled studies, the effect appears \"very small,\" she said.\n\nKaralunas noted that foods containing the dyes are also loaded with other additives, making it difficult to discern what negative health impacts can be solely traced back to them.\n\nBradman echoed that products with high levels of food dyes are often those that \"we think of as junk food\" and contain higher levels of refined carbohydrates, fats, and other additives.\n\nMore:Need after-school snack ideas? Healthiest options to add into your kid's routine.\n\nState lawmakers go after food dye banned in cosmetics\n\nSome legislation on the horizon takes specific aim at Red 3. Karalunas said, among color additives, red dyes, including Red 40, show a \"particularly\" strong link with hyperactivity in scientific research.\n\nRed 3 has also been linked to cancer by some animal studies. The FDA banned the chemical's use in cosmetic products in 1990 in response to those concerns, but it remains in food products.\n\nIn the years since, advocates have launched numerous campaigns to regulate the chemical – last year, research nonprofit Consumer Reports sent a letter urging the maker of Peeps candies to stop using the dye, and launched a petition when the company did not respond.\n\nCalifornia was also first out of the gate to ban the chemical. Last year, the state enacted a law dubbed the \"Skittles ban\" that gives manufacturers until 2027 to cut Red 3 out of their recipes.\n\nMihalek, whose bill targets Red 3, among other chemicals, called regulating the chemical \"low-hanging fruit.\"\n\n\"We're talking about making something a pretty red color, with the risk of cancer and a whole other list of health risks associated with it,\" she said. \"It doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nMore state lawmakers have introduced similar bills. The Illinois State Senate in April passed a bill that would ban Red 3, along with three other chemical additives, sending it next to the state House for consideration.\n\n\"The FDA doesn’t allow you to put it on your face for makeup. But yet kids are eating this in candy,” Illinois State Sen. Steve McClure told the Senate, according to local news reports.\n\nIllinois State Sen. Willie Preston, who introduced the bill, said lawmakers have \"a short window\" to get the bill through a veto and lame duck session before the end of the year.\n\nIf they are successful, the bill will pass before Thanksgiving. If not, \"I intend to refile that bill and continue to work that product through the process to make sure that we protect the food supply here in Illinois,\" he said.\n\nLegislative efforts to restrict the chemicals have drawn the ire of food manufacturers and industry groups, who argue that they aren't science-based.\n\nThe National Confectioners' Association said in a news release responding to the Illinois bill, \"It’s time to stop pretending that Illinois state legislators have the scientific expertise to make these very important regulatory decisions. Usurping FDA’s authority does nothing but create a patchwork of inconsistent requirements that increase food costs, create confusion around food safety, and erode consumer confidence.” The association did not return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nLawmakers pledge to reintroduce bills next year\n\nIn the last decade, bills targeting Red 3 and the six food dyes in the recent California bill have been introduced in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit.\n\nSome lawmakers say they'll keep pushing, even if the clock runs out to pass legislation this year.\n\nWith just a few months left in Pennsylvania's legislative session, Mihalek likely won't see her bill become law this year. If she is re-elected in November, she plans to reintroduce it next year, she said.\n\n\"First and foremost, the bill is creating awareness,\" she said.\n\nThe current regulatory framework, she said, puts it \"on the consumer to stop buying these products that contain ingredients that have decades of evidence of cancer, behavioral issues,\" she said.\n\nAt least one bill for a nationwide ban is already on the table in Congress – in June, U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who represents Florida's 13th congressional district, unveiled the \"Do or Dye Act,\" which would deem \"unsafe\" any foods containing Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and \"substantially similar\" additives.\n\n\"We knew that they were banned already in foreign countries because of the known health risks,\" Luna told USA TODAY. If the bill passes, she hopes producers \"have to use alternatives, or just make it healthy, just not add it at all.\"\n\nThe legislation is important to Luna, who hopes to mirror it in amendments she's introducing to the farm bill, which has until the end of the month to pass Congress.\n\n'Superficial way to make food appealing'\n\nThomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said he anticipates California's movement on the issue will spur other states to act, although many advocates believe federal action is needed.\n\nThe center petitioned the FDA in 2008 to ban eight approved food dyes, force manufacturers to put a warning label on products containing the chemicals, and require new testing. The agency convened a meeting to revisit the issue in 2011, but determined that the link had not been established, and recommended further research.\n\nFederal regulators have sometimes forced recalls of products that fail to disclose dyes. Two drink products were recalled earlier this summer for containing an undeclared amount of Yellow 5 and Red 40.\n\nGalligan now hopes the California bill will force manufacturers to replace color additives with natural substances in products sold nationwide. \"It's more challenging for them to produce a California-specific product than just to change their entire production line,\" he said.\n\nEuropean regulations produced a similar effect years ago. After two British government-funded studies in 2004 and 2007 reached similar conclusions to the California review, the European Union set stricter limits on the chemicals, including requiring producers to label foods with some dyes. In response, some food producers switched to using natural colors. Nestle, for instance, adopted annatto, made from the seeds of the achiote tree, to color the gooey centers of Butterfinger candy bars sold in Europe, according to the government of the Netherlands.\n\n\"The food industry clearly found them to be effective marketing tools, and that's really what they are,\" Galligan said. \"It's really just there as a cosmetic, superficial way to make food appealing so that we spend our money on them.\"\n\nThe FDA completed its last exposure assessment of the six chemicals banned in the recent California bill in 2016, the agency told USA TODAY. The FDA will host a public meeting to take \"a fresh look at the process\" of assessing chemicals in food products after they hit the market.\n\nGalligan believes new state-level bills, including California's, may have spurred the upcoming meeting.\n\n\"In some ways, the state action seems to be motivating both industry and FDA to act where, previously, they hadn't,\" he said. \"You have a situation where evidence of harm emerges after approval, and nothing gets done for decades.\"\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

California's AB 2316, known as the California School Food Safety Act, is now on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk.\n\nThe bill says state research suggests such synthetic dyes can result in hyperactivity and other behavioral problems. Similar previous research prompted the European Union to restrict food coloring. Nearly all of the products that the California bill would ban in schools require warning labels in E.U. products.\n\nThe bill would ban commercial dyes of Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, in public schools in the nation’s largest state.\n\n“California has a responsibility to protect our students from chemicals that harm children and interfere with their ability to learn,” state Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who authored the bill, said in a statement. He said that he struggled with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, and he is now a parent.\n\nOn Saturday, a spokesperson said Newsom’s office didn’t comment on pending legislation. The deadline for Newsom to sign or veto legislation is Sept. 30, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe nonprofit Environmental Working Group and the California Medical Association, which represents doctors, supported the bill.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals for the dyes banned under AB 2316 date back decades, the environmental nonprofit said. Those approvals were based on old studies not designed to detect behavioral effects in children, the medical association had said in its support of AB 2316.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a dye industry representative, opposed the bill because it overrode existing food safety rules, and the group disputed findings about adverse health effects. John Hewlitt, the association's senior vice president of packaging, sustainability and state affairs, said the bill was \"advancing a political agenda.\"\n\n\"The passage of this bill could cost schools and families money, limit choice and access, and create consumer confusion,\" he said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \"The approach taken by California politicians flies in the face of our science and risk-based process and is not the precedent we should be setting when it comes to feeding our families.”\n\nA 2021 state Environmental Protection Agency assessment found American youth diagnosed with ADHD increased in the last 20 years, which prompted the state to look at food dyes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has similarly tracked increases in ADHD diagnoses in children in recent years.\n\nFocusing on seven food dyes, including those that would be banned under AB 2316, state researchers reviewed prior studies on the effects of these dyes in humans and laboratory animals. Findings indicated they were linked to adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children, and children varied in sensitivity.\n\nOn Friday, an FDA spokesperson told NBC News they had reviewed literature cited in California’s legislation. While saying most children have no “adverse effects” when they eat foods with color additives, the spokesperson reportedly said some evidence suggests certain children may be sensitive.\n\nIf signed into law, California’s ban would take effect in schools beginning in 2027.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2025/01/15/what-foods-is-red-dye-3-in/77724349007/", "title": "Red dye 3 foods: What drinks, candies are affected by FDA ban", "text": "Your favorite bright red drinks and candies may soon have a different look as the Food and Drug Administration banned Red No. 3.\n\nRed No. 3 is a color additive made from petroleum that is used to give products a bright, cherry-red color.

Organic farmers also use natural fertilizers, rotate crops or use mulch to manage weeds, and they do not use pesticides.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has organic certification standards that regulate how organic foods must be grown, handled and processed. Products cannot be labeled as organic unless they are USDA-certified. This earns them the right to display the USDA seal, as long as they are greater than 95 percent organic.\n\nAre 'organic' and 'natural' the same thing?\n\nThe terms \"natural\" and \"organic\" are not interchangeable. Some food labels may make claims that their products are \"natural,\" \"all natural,\" \"hormone-free\" or \"free-range.\" While truthful, don't confuse these statements with the term \"organic.\" Foods only qualify as organic if they are grown and processed according to USDA standards. A product can be both natural and organic, or it could be just one or the other.\n\nSo is organic food more nutritious?\n\nThe answer is not 100 percent certain, though several studies have been performed, and more are in progress. However, the processes by which organic meats and produce are grown are reported to result in more nutrient-rich foods. For instance, the use of fast-growth fertilizers in conventional growing means that plants spend more of their energy on getting as large as possible, while less energy is allocated to building nutrients.\n\nWhy do people choose to buy organic food?\n\nFood additives . Many people are concerned with a growing number of growth hormones, artificial sweeteners and other additives commonly used in conventional foods. The use of these additives — as well as processing aids, preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, and fortifying agents — is restricted or banned under organic regulations. Many recent studies have shown the negative impact too much of these substances can have on our health.\n\n.

The use of these additives — as well as processing aids, preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, and fortifying agents — is restricted or banned under organic regulations. Many recent studies have shown the negative impact too much of these substances can have on our health. Pesticides . Conventional farmers make use of synthetic pesticides to protect their crops from insects, diseases and molds. These pesticides can leave a residue on produce. Organic growers, however, utilize tactics such as predator insects, insect traps, beneficial microorganisms and careful crop selection (disease-resistant varieties) to control crop-damaging pests. Since organic foods typically carry less pesticide residue than conventionally grown foods, many shoppers feel more comfortable buying organic products. However, the residue on most products does not exceed government safety thresholds, whether organic or not.\n\n.

World’s first malaria vaccine\n\n(Image credit: Brian Ongoro/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOn 6 October, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the green light for the rollout of a malaria vaccine that experts said had the potential to save the lives of tens of thousands of children across Africa every year.\n\nDeveloped by UK-based pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the RTS,S vaccine, also known as Mosquirix, is the first developed for malaria or any other parasitic disease. The approval for widespread use of the jab was “based on results from an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 800 000 children since 2019”, said the WHO.\n\nDirector General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus heralded the decision as a “historic moment” for “science, child health and malaria control”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The sample, gathered in September, is the first ever piece of Mars “destined to be flown back to Earth for study”.\n\nIn what Nasa administrator Bill Nelson described as “a momentous achievement”, the rover managed the manoeuvre following an unsuccessful attempt the month before, when the rock crumbled into powder before it could be stowed in the sample tube.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nScientists hope that by bringing a bit of the Red Planet back to Earth, we can “gain more insight into Mars' potential for life”, said Space.com.\n\n4. ‘Most diverse’ awards season ever\n\n(Image credit: Chris Pizzello/Pool/Getty Images)\n\nThe Guardian’s film editor Catherine Shoard wrote that “this year’s Oscar for inclusivity goes to... the Academy”, after half of the gongs at the awards ceremony in April were won by people of colour. Nomadland director Chloe Zhao made history by becoming the first woman of colour and only the second woman ever to win the Academy Award for best director.\n\nThe 74th British Academy Film Awards (Bafta), held at London’s Royal Albert Hall in April, marked another step forward for diversity. In “the most inclusive ceremony since the awards began”, 16 of the 24 acting nominees were people of colour, and four of the candidates for best director were women, BuzzFeed reported.\n\nThe Baftas for television, handed out at a ceremony in June, also produced the “most diverse list of winners in its history”, said The Daily Telegraph. Black actors won three of the four acting awards, while the Virgin Media Must-See Moment – chosen by the public – went to the Diversity dance troop’s Black Lives Matter-inspired routine.\n\n5. Olympic gold medal sharing\n\nItaly’s Gianmarco Tamberi and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar asked to share the top step of the podium at the Tokyo Olympic Games in August, after tying in the men’s high jump. The two athletes had been offered a jump-off to decide the winner, but Barshim asked whether they could have “two golds” instead.\n\nDescribing Tamberi as “one of my best friends” after officials agreed, Barshim said: “This is a dream come true. It is the true spirit, the sportsman spirit, and we are here delivering this message.”\n\nAccording to The Independent, their joint victory marked “the first time since 1912 that a gold medal has been shared in athletics”.\n\n6. ‘Game-changer’ heart disease drug\n\nA heart treatment newly approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) for use in England was expected to “protect tens of thousands of lives by cutting the number of people who have a heart attack or stroke”, The Guardian reported at the start of September.\n\nDelivered in the form of a twice-yearly injection, Inclisiran “works by boosting the liver’s ability to reduce the body’s level of ‘bad’ cholesterol”, or LDL, and was shown to be highly effective during clinical trials, said the paper. Health Secretary Sajid Javid welcomed the “huge step forward in tackling the scourge of heart disease”.\n\n7. Miscarriage leave approved in NZ\n\nIn March, New Zealand’s parliament “voted unanimously” to give women and their partners three days of bereavement leave after a miscarriage or stillbirth, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe pioneering legislation “applies to parents, their partners, and parents planning to have a child through adoption or surrogacy”, the paper said.\n\nLabour MP Ginny Andersen, who drafted the bill, said the aim was to “give women the confidence to be able to request that leave if it was required, as opposed to just being stoic and getting on with life, when they knew that they needed time, physically or psychologically, to get over the grief”.\n\n(Image credit: Albert Perez/Getty Images)\n\nIn late October, Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo became the “only current top-flight male professional footballer in the world” to come out as gay, said the BBC.\n\nThe Australian midfielder, then aged 21, announced on social media that he was “ready to speak about something personal that I'm finally comfortable to talk about in my life”. In a video shared by his club on Twitter, he said: “I’m a footballer and I’m gay. All I want to do is play football and be treated equally.”\n\nAmid a huge outpouring of support from across the world, Stonewall F.C. told the i news site that Cavallo’s story is “a sign of the progress that has been made across the game”. But there is “much more to be done so that others like Josh can be open and free to be themselves”, added Stonewall, Britain’s top-ranking LGBTQ+ football team.\n\n9. Cervical cancer rates down by 90%\n\nCervical cancer rates are nearly 90% lower among women who were given the human papillomavirus (HPV) jab as teenagers, according to results from the first major study into the vaccine programme.\n\nThe study, published in The Lancet in early November, found that “there were around five cervical cancer cases per year among women who were offered the vaccine between the ages of 12 and 13 and are now in their 20s”, said the i news site. By comparison, before the jabs were first rolled out back in 2008, there were around 50 cases each year.\n\n“It’s been incredible to see the impact of HPV vaccination and now we can prove it prevented hundreds of women from developing cancer in England,” said Professor Peter Sasieni of King’s College London, the lead author of the study.\n\n10. Britney freed\n\n(Image credit: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn 12 November, a judge approved the termination of Britney Spears’ conservatorship, freeing the singer “from the controversial legal arrangement that has controlled her life for nearly 14 years”, said The Guardian’s Los Angeles-based correspondent Sam Levin.\n\nThe star’s career has been in the hands of legal guardians since 2008, when a court-ordered agreement was imposed amid concerns over Spears’s mental health.\n\nHer long-running battle to regain her independence from the courts had been backed by a grass-roots movement of fans known as the #FreeBritney campaign, which gained renewed public attention following the release of documentary Framing Britney Spears earlier this year.\n\n11. Same-sex marriage go-aheads\n\n(Image credit: Claudio Santana/Getty Images)\n\nOn 7 December, Chile approved a landmark law allowing same-sex marriage in the historically Catholic country – joining around 30 other nations that have legalised same-sex unions. The legislation was “overwhelmingly approved” by Chile parliament, said the BBC, and also enables gay couples to adopt children.\n\nThe vote came just over two months after the Swiss public backed a ‘Marriage for All’ initiative by a nearly two-thirds majority, in what Reuters described as a “ground-breaking referendum” in “one of the last countries in Western Europe to legalise gay marriage”. Same-sex couples will be able to wed in Switzerland from 1 July 2022.\n\nThe local government in Japanese capital Tokyo, which has a population of around 14m, has also announced plans to allow same-sex marriage in the city from April next year.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/entertainment/oscar-nominated-foreign-films-2022/index.html", "title": "Oscar nominated foreign films 2022: Where to watch the Oscar ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe best international feature film category at the Academy Awards could, in some ways, be compared to flying economy. Often, the five films that get a seat aboard the Oscars seem squashed in the back, lest they take up space that Hollywood might want to luxuriate in. You’d like to upgrade to best picture? With twice the room and more prestige, who wouldn’t. But many of those seats still appear to be reserved for English-language pictures.\n\nHowever, things are changing for the better, with Academy voters finding increasing space for international films in other categories. As the awards continues to ask existential questions of itself, this is cause for celebration.\n\nIn the Oscars’ 94th year, there are a few firsts among the nominees for best international feature. “Drive My Car” by Ryusuke Hamaguchi became the first Japanese film to be nominated for best picture, and “Flee” by Danish writer-director Jonas Poher Rasmussen became the first film nominated across best international feature film, best animated feature and best documentary feature. Meanwhile Bhutanese cinema received its first nomination in any category with Pawo Choyning Dorji’s “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom.”\n\nNorwegian nominee “The Worst Person in the World” and “Drive My Car” both made the cut in writing categories – director Joachim Trier and Eskil Vogt sharing a nomination for best original screenplay, and Hamaguchi and Takamasa Oe for best adapted – while Hamaguchi finds himself only the third Japanese filmmaker nominated for best director.\n\n“Drive My Car” ties Akira Kurosawa’s “Ran” (1986) for most nominations ever for a Japanese film, but a “Parasite”-level sweep is unlikely, even if few would quibble with the movie’s brilliance. However, the repeated inroads of non-English language cinema suggests, to borrow a phrase from Bong Joon-ho, that voters are overcoming the one inch tall barrier of subtitles and finding a whole world of movies to celebrate. No doubt the Academy’s increasingly international membership is helping too.\n\nLast year’s resurgent festival scene and a backlog of releases due to the pandemic meant there was even greater choice than usual. As always, each country may only nominate one movie for best international feature, with 93 countries submitting this year. Many big-hitters missed out. France had Julia Ducournau’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner “Titane” and Audrey Diwan’s Venice Golden Lion winner “Happening” at its disposal; “Titane” was submitted over “Happening,” only to fail to make the shortlist. Spain submitted Fernando Leon de Aranoa’s “The Good Boss” over Pedro Almodovar’s “Parallel Mothers,” only for it to strike out and see Almodovar’s film nominated for original score (Alberto Iglesias) and star Penelope Cruz for best actress. Romania’s Berlin-winner “Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn” by Radu Jude, two-time Iranian Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi’s “A Hero” and Austrian submission “Great Freedom” by Sebastian Meise are all fantastic films that were either not shortlisted or nominated.\n\nThere was such an abundance of great international cinema, the question of whether this category should be expanded to 10 nominees, like best picture, must be asked once more. Until then, we have these five. If you need to catch up on this year’s crop, here’s all the details, along with where to watch them.\n\n“The Hand of God”\n\nFilippo Scotti in \"The Hand of God.\" Gianni Fiorito/Netflix\n\nItalian director Paolo Sorrentino is up to his usual tricks in “The Hand of God,” setting them loose on a work of poignant, sometimes bizarre, autofiction.\n\nSet in sweltering 1980s Naples, Sorrentino’s stand-in Fabietto (Filippo Scotti) is an awkward teenager struggling to find his voice among his large, bickering carnival of a family. The talk of the town is the possible move of football megastar Diego Maradona to local club Napoli, but Fabietto is equally preoccupied with his aunt Patrizia (a disquieting Luisa Ranieri). An abused woman with mental health concerns, the director chooses to present this primarily through the medium of her exposed breasts, at which her nephew can’t help but stare. It is not the most conventional sexual awakening committed to screen, and where the film goes from there is eyebrow-raising to say the least (kudos to Sorrentino for his honesty if it’s all true).\n\nThat aside, there’s beauty aplenty in how director and regular cinematographer Daria D’Antonio shoot their hometown. Visual flourishes and a Fellini-esque menagerie of larger-than-life characters combine in an elegy to the city and the director’s youth – one defined by a tragedy that set Sorrentino on his path.\n\n“You’ve got to have a story to tell,” a director urges aspiring filmmaker Fabietto toward the end of the movie. Sorrentino, already an Oscar winner for “The Great Beauty” in 2013, hasn’t exactly made a bad fist of telling fictional stories. By returning to Naples and telling his own, he’s come full circle and made one of his richest films to date.\n\n“The Hand of God” is available to watch on Netflix\n\n“Drive My Car”\n\nHidetoshi Nishijima and Toko Miura as Yusuke Kafuku and Misaki Watari in \"Drive My Car.\" Courtesy of Sideshow and Janus Films\n\nJapanese director Ryusuke Hamaguchi had a huge 2021, debuting not one but two critically acclaimed films. “Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy” enchanted the Berlin Film Festival, but it was his three-hour adaptation of Haruki Murakami short story “Drive My Car” that gained traction after its debut at Cannes.\n\nThe adaptation is an expansion of the story of actor Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) grieving the sudden death of his wife. Two years on, he’s hired to direct a production of Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya,” where Kufuku meets chauffeur Misaki Watari (Toko Miura), with whom he has unlikely kinship. Through chance and his own making, the past surrounds Kufuku, forcing him to confront his loss.\n\nHamaguchi’s intricately woven story contemplates the disconnect between inner turmoil and outward stoicism. He brilliantly uses Chekhov’s play, with its thematic overlap, as a safe space for characters to wrestle with their real lives. By casting the play as a multilingual production (actors perform in Korean, Tagalog, Mandarin and Korean Sign Language, among others), Hamaguchi steers the audience’s attention towards language and the body. Like Kafuku, we become attuned to when the two fail to tell the same story. His frustrations become our own, his direction of his actors a proxy for what he desires for himself: self-knowledge, and perhaps through that, catharsis.\n\nThis is intellectual filmmaking that offers no concessions to the audience. It demands your attention and offers rich rewards in return. Hamaguchi may be surprised by the Academy’s love for the film, but that comes off the back of topping multiple critics’ best of year lists. The film has already won a BAFTA and must be considered red-hot favorite to take the Oscar on Sunday.\n\n“Drive My Car” is available to watch on HBO Max (like CNN, a WarnerMedia company) and Amazon Prime Video in the US.\n\nRead more: Ryusuke Hamaguchi is as surprised as anyone by the Oscar love for ‘Drive My Car’\n\n“The Worst Person in the World”\n\nHerbert Nordrum and Renate Reinsve as Eivind and Julie in Joachim Trier's \"The Worst Person in the World.\" courtesy Mubi\n\nThe capstone of Joachim Trier’s Oslo Trilogy, “The Worst Person in the World” refuses to stick to the rom-com blueprint in its portrait of the Norwegian city and its inhabitants.\n\nJulie (Renate Reinsve) is approaching 30 and is coasting. Her older boyfriend Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) is looking to get serious, but Julie has reservations; thoughts that crystallize when free-spirited Eivind (Herbert Nordrum) walks into her life, setting off a charisma bomb that will go down as one of cinema’s great meet-cutes.\n\nTrier has no interest in fairy tale endings, however. His and Eskil Vogt’s rich and textured script drills into the ideation and idealization of modern living, and the life that happens while you’re making – and breaking – plans.\n\nJulie something of a paradox, riven by impulsiveness and indecisiveness (and she’s privileged enough that she can be). The writing is strong, but this is a film propelled by a star turn. Reinsve’s iridescent performance won her the best actress award at Cannes (remarkably, she’d been about to give up the industry before being cast) and as Julie she’s nothing short of a marvel; a muddle of inconsistencies and equally beguiling and infuriating. In other words: deeply human.\n\n“The Worst Person in the World” paints a portrait that’s so arrestingly real, it recasts much of what came before in the genre as synthetic. For romcoms, this is a corner turned.\n\n“The Worst Person in the World” is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV in the US.\n\nRead more: Joachim Trier ripped up the romcom script with ‘The Worst Person in the World’\n\n“Flee”\n\nAmin (right), the subject of Jonas Poher Rasmussen's \"Flee.\" Final Cut for Real\n\nJonas Poher Rasmussen’s international animated documentary represents an impressively original triple threat at the Oscars this weekend.\n\nThe Danish film debuted at Sundance in 2021 where it won the world cinema documentary award and it’s been attracting high-profile admirers ever since. It centers on Amin, a gay Afghan who as a boy fled Kabul in the 1990s. Now an academic in his thirties living in Denmark, he narrates the story of his perilous flight, dredging up myriad horrors that are written and rewritten before our eyes as what was once suppressed breaches consciousness and finds form.\n\nThe choice of animation allows Amin (a pseudonym) anonymity, but what it affords Rasmussen is dazzling scope for creative expression, utilizing a variety of styles from smooth rotoscope to scratchy sketching in stylistic collusion with the tone of the moment. It’s truly beautiful, impactful filmmaking that’s not quickly forgotten.\n\n“Flee” is available to watch on Hulu and Apple TV in the US.\n\n“Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom”\n\nSherab Dorji as Ugyen in \"Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom.\" Kinley Wangchuk/Jigme Thinley\n\nThis year’s surprise contender, “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” is only Bhutan’s second entry to the Academy Awards and its first nominee.\n\nWriter-director Pawo Choyning Dorji’s mild-mannered addition to the “city-slicker-goes-to-the-countryside-and-learns-what’s-important-in-life” canon follows Ugyen (Sherab Dorji), a government employee and wannabe singer whose dreams of Australia are put on hold when he’s sent to teach in the remote mountain community of Lunana. Initially dismissive, his petulance gives way to an appreciation of rural life and the culture he was so ready to leave behind, helped by cute kid Pem Zam (Pem Zam) and singer and local beauty Saldon (Kelden Lhamo Gurung).\n\nIt’s familiar story, but perhaps one shouldn’t hold that against the film. “Lunana’s” trump card is its stunning setting and window into an underexposed part of the world. Handsomely shot by Jigme Tenzing, we see both bustling capital Thimphu and the majestic foothills of the Himalayas, an idyll if ever there was one. The guileless turns of the film’s real-life highlander cast also grounds the film nicely and act as an effective foil to Ugyen.\n\nAcademy voters have plucked from relative obscurity a film that debuted at the London Film Festival way back in 2019. Dorji beat out giants of world cinema to bag a nomination – and with a debut feature, no less. All this considered, “Lunana” represents a landmark in Bhutanese cinema.\n\n“Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” is available to watch on Kanopy and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards takes place on Sunday March 27.", "authors": ["Thomas Page"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/07/26/helen-mirren-birthday/87564320/", "title": "10 times Helen Mirren was a bona fide treasure", "text": "Jaleesa M. Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nShe may be a Grammy away from an EGOT but perhaps the greatest gift Helen Mirren has shared throughout her storied career — which, over the last five decades, has garnered four Emmys, a Tony, two Golden Globes, five BAFTA Awards and one Oscar — is not her acting prowess, but her unrepentant honesty.\n\nIn honor of the standard-bearer's 71st birthday, we look back on 10 times Mirren didn't give a Dame and told it like it is.\n\n1. When she broke down how language reinforces the infantilization of women.\n\n\"Two phrases I hate in reference to female characters are 'strong' and 'feisty,'\" Mirren said in a December 1997 interview with The Independent. \"They really annoy me. It's the most condescending thing. You say that about a three-year-old. It infantilizes women.\"\n\n2. When she lamented the lack of compelling roles for women — and, in particular, older women.\n\n\"There isn't a King Lear for women, or a Henry V, or a Richard III,\" Mirren affirmed in the same interview with The Independent. \"You reach a level where you can handle that stuff technically and mentally, and it's not there.\"\n\n3. When she slammed Hollywood's \"penis worship.\"\n\n\"I resent in my life the survival of some very mediocre male actors and the professional demise of some very brilliant female ones,\" Mirren said during THR's Power 100 Women in Entertainment breakfast back in December 2010. \"With all respect to you many brilliant and successful women in this room — executives, producers, writers, directors — really not too much has changed in the canon of Hollywood filmmaking, which continues to worship at the altar of the 18- to 25-year-old man ... and his penis.\"\n\n4. When she confirmed the hardest period in life.\n\n\"The hardest period in life is one’s twenties,\" Mirren wrote in an August 2011 piece for Esquire. \"It’s a shame because you’re your most gorgeous and you’re physically in peak condition. But it’s actually when you’re most insecure and full of self-doubt. When you don’t know what’s going to happen, it’s frightening.\"\n\n5. When she maintained that Hollywood's \"women problem\" is just symptomatic of systemic sexism.\n\n\"When roles for women in real life change, then you will see change in the film industry,\" Mirren toldThe Guardian in September 2015. \"If we happen to see a (female) president of the United States, and a world expert on marine biology comes on television and it’s a woman, or the female head of a petroleum company on the news.\"\n\n6. When she preached on the importance of powering through fear.\n\n(Warning: This video contains some explicit language.)\n\n\"I’m frightened all the time, of everything, really,\" Mirren admitted during TheWrap's June 2015 Power Women Breakfast in New York City. \"The point is not to be afraid of the fact that you’re afraid. You get on with it.\"\n\n7. When she was appointed the new face of L’Oréal Paris​ in 2014 and asked for honest (read: untouched) photos.\n\n\"I said, 'You take me with my attitude or just don’t have me, have someone else,'\" Mirren shared with The Guardian in September 2015. \"They said, 'Absolutely, that’s what we want. We want truth, we want transparency.'\"\n\n8. When she dropped one of the greatest PSAs of all time.\n\nMirren teamed up with Budweiser for a 2016 Super Bowl commercial, during which she put on her sternest headmaster face and promptly frightened fans out of going within 10 feet of their vehicle while under the influence: \"If you drive drunk, you, simply put, are a short-sighted, utterly useless, oxygen-wasting human form of pollution.\" Tell us how you really feel, Dame!\n\n9. When she honored Prince's legacy in the most Mirren way possible.\n\nMirren arrived at the 2016 White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 30, modeling a semi-sheer, purple gown and a temporary, purple tattoo, a tribute to the unpronounceable symbol Prince (who then embraced the alias, \"The Artist Formerly Known as Prince\") assumed during his campaign to break free from his former record label, Warner Bros. Speaking to The Washington Post about the tribute, Mirren noted: \"I admire great artists and he was a great artist.\"\n\n10. When she was frank on feminism.\n\n\"Any woman now actually is a feminist,\" Mirren toldMarie Claire earlier this month. \"They don't realize it, because they're living in a world feminism has, to a certain extent, created for them — which is very exciting because it's entitled. That's what I love about them. They're entitled.\"\n\nHappy birthday, Queen!", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/europe/monarchy-modernizing-queen-relevant-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "TV, travel, walkabouts: How the Queen stayed relevant and ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\n“I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.”\n\nThis line, delivered on Elizabeth II’s 21st birthday, defines her career like few others. Within five years, she would be Queen – and she’d go on to be the longest serving monarch in British history.\n\nThe speech was given in Cape Town on April 21, 1947 during a tour of South Africa – when it was still a British colony – and it speaks to several key themes of her reign.\n\nFirstly, Elizabeth II dedicated herself to lifelong service. This explains why she never abdicated, even as many of her younger contemporaries did. Between February 2013 and June 19, 2014, four European monarchs stepped down: Pope Benedict XVI of Vatican City; Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; King Albert II of Belgium; and King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nElizabeth, a devout Christian who rarely missed a Sunday at church, resisted the exodus because of the promise she made not just to her subjects but to God. There’s a clue to that at the end of her 21st birthday speech: “I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.”\n\nEven when her husband, Prince Philip, retired in 2017, Elizabeth continued public engagements and brought in other members of the family to accompany her as needed. Just days after Philip’s death in 2021, she resumed official duties with the appointment of new ambassadors to the UK.\n\nSecondly, in that 1947 speech, she devoted herself to the “great imperial family,” by which she meant the British empire. The UK was losing world dominance at the time. It was the year India declared independence and ousted her father, King George VI, as head of state.\n\nDozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nElizabeth came to see that as an opportunity rather than a threat. India had asked to remain part of the Commonwealth and two years later the request was granted, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 1949. The monarch’s role in India was redefined as “the symbol of the free association of the independent Member Nations and as such Head of the Commonwealth.”\n\nThat was a model later adopted by other newly independent states, as British rule came to an end across Africa, Asia and other regions of the world.\n\nWhen the Queen inherited the title of Head of The Commonwealth from her father, she embraced it – which is why she is often credited with the “managed decline of the empire.” She may have lost her empire, but she retained her international footprint and reinforced it by traveling more than any of her predecessors.\n\nShe visited every one of the Commonwealth nations apart from Rwanda and Cameroon and made sure she attended key Commonwealth meetings to show her support. As she got older, she cut back on international travel but called on her eldest son, Prince Charles, to represent her instead.\n\nThen-Prince Charles speaks during the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on June 24. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIn November 2021, Barbados severed its last imperial ties to Britain, removing the Queen as head of state as it marked its 55th anniversary of independence. Like others before it, the island nation has remained part of the Commonwealth.\n\nOn Saturday, Antigua and Barbuda signaled it could be the next country to go its own way, with the prime minister saying he wanted to hold a referendum to become a republic within three years.\n\nBeyond that, the republican movements in Australia and Jamaica have perhaps the most momentum, but their biggest obstacle was always the Queen herself.\n\nIn July 2017, then-Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull – a co-founder of the Australian Republican Movement – summed it up when he was granted an audience at Buckingham Palace. “Although I am a Republican, I am also an Elizabethan,” he tweeted. “It was an honour to meet Her Majesty today at Buckingham Palace.”\n\nKeeping public loyalty\n\nOver the decades, the Queen did as she promised and devoted herself to the service of the British people. This, coupled with her ability to adapt with the changing times and make sure she remained in the public eye, meant she largely kept their loyalty despite painful upheaval within the royal family.\n\nAs a result, the British republican movement gained little traction during Elizabeth’s reign except for two periods. The first was in 1992, which she herself described as her Annus Horribilis, or “terrible year.” Two of her children, Charles and Andrew, announced their separations and her daughter, Anne, got divorced. Her favored home, Windsor Castle, also went up in flames.\n\nA fire in 1992 wreaks havoc in Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Nineteen-ninety-two is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she told an audience at Guildhall in November of that year. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis.’ I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.”\n\nHer other big low was after the death of daughter-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. There was a backlash when people noticed the flag hadn’t been lowered over Buckingham Palace. Newspapers questioned why the Queen hadn’t returned to London from her holiday home in Scotland. She had her reasons. That flag had never been lowered even on the death of a monarch and she stayed in Scotland because she was helping to care for Diana’s children, Princes William and Harry.\n\nEventually, she returned to the capital and paid tribute to Diana in a live broadcast. She also had the flag lowered for Diana’s funeral.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nNonetheless, Elizabeth’s approval rating didn’t fully recover until the blockbuster wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in 2011. William was given free rein on whom he wanted to marry – and he chose a commoner. This turned the story into a fairytale and the whole world tuned in to watch.\n\nWilliam was also given free rein on whom he invited to the ceremony. He told a documentary team in 2012 how he was handed an official guest list and didn’t recognize anyone on it, so he had a word with his grandmother. “There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on, not one person I knew or Catherine knew,” he said. “I went to her and said: ‘Listen, I’ve got this list, not one person I know. What do I do?’ and she (The Queen) went: ‘Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we’ll add those we need to in due course. It’s your day.’”\n\nThe Queen was allowing the younger generation to do things their own way and appeal to people their own age.\n\nAfter the wedding, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – as they were then styled – were also granted considerable freedom to set up William’s own court at Kensington Palace.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the leeway his younger brother was allowed with his wedding to Meghan Markle. Not only was she a biracial, American actress, feminist and divorcee but she wasn’t a member of the Church of England, though she was brought up an Anglican.\n\nAs important as it was for all these elements to be reflected on her big day at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, it was also important for the monarchy – and the Queen knew it. The gospel choir; the sermon from Episcopalian bishop Michael Curry; the way Meghan walked herself down the first part of the aisle: she made the royal family relevant to so many people it wasn’t relevant to before and it was a triumph all round.\n\nEveryone involved was a winner, just as they all lost when Meghan and Harry felt they couldn’t carry on in their royal roles and moved to North America two years later. They gave their reasons why in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, accusing “the firm” of failing to support them and accusing an unnamed family member of making a racist remark about their son’s skin color.\n\nWhilst Harry was scathing in the interview about his father, he said he continued to have respect for his grandmother.\n\nAnother major challenge for the Queen in recent years was the scandal surrounding her son, Prince Andrew, and his connection to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew stepped back from royal duties in late 2019 amid the furor.\n\nIn January 2022, the Queen stripped Andrew of his remaining military titles and charities, as well as his right to be called His Royal Highness, as her son vowed to battle on in a civil sex abuse case brought against him in the United States. The following month the prince reached a deal with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Andrew repeatedly rejected the allegations against him.\n\nThe Queen largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga, though questions remain over how her son was able to afford the undisclosed legal bill, which was expected to run into the millions.\n\nAlthough the palace would not comment on the settlement at the time, insiders believed the move would have been welcomed by the institution ahead of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations later that summer.\n\nMembers of the royal family watch an RAF flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 2, 2022, as part of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHarnessing the power of media\n\nThe Queen’s ability to adapt was perhaps best exemplified by her unquestionably historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. Mary McAleese, the Irish President, described the visit as the culmination of the success of the peace process. A transient politician would never have lent the occasion the same weight.\n\nThe Queen received a standing ovation after a speech at Dublin Castle and plaudits from across the political divide. The following year, she followed up with a visit to Northern Ireland where she put aside the murder of her cousin, the Earl of Mountbatten, by the IRA in 1979, to shake hands with Martin McGuinness. He was allegedly an IRA commander at the time of Mountbatten’s death.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shakes hands with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, left, watched by First Minister Peter Robinson and Prince Philip at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on June 27, 2012. Paul Faith/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result: one handshake caught on camera and another footnote in history with the Queen at the center of it.\n\nElizabeth understood the power of the media from an early age, and harnessing it was to become another key theme of her reign. That speech on her 21st birthday was recorded not just for radio but also for the emerging medium of television. At her coronation in 1953, she personally requested that cameras be allowed in to Westminster Abbey to broadcast the ceremony live.\n\nPeople famously went out to buy television sets so they could watch. It was a sacrosanct moment the public had never before been able to witness; they remembered where they were and who they watched with. The Queen had inadvertently invented event television. All she wanted was for as many people as possible to feel part of it.\n\nA phrase often attributed to Elizabeth was that “you have to be seen to be believed.” She understood that it wasn’t enough to go out in public, but she had to be seen there. Television gave her a bigger audience and when color was introduced, she wore brighter shades so she would stand out.\n\nShe allowed cameras into her day-to-day engagements too, whether it was opening a hospital or attending a local event of some sort. Instead of walking past the crowds of well-wishers, she stopped and talked to them, something which was almost unheard of at the time. Those “walkabouts” would appear in the media and show her amongst the people, not hidden behind palace walls. She supported hundreds of charities and good causes so she could get out and meet even more people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series \"Coronation Street,\" on July 8, 2021 in Manchester, England. Scott Heppell /WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nWhen the digital revolution arrived, the Queen embraced it with her own website. She established a social media presence long before her children or grandchildren did. The internet presented her with another way of connecting with her public and making herself relevant to their lives. She didn’t have to say anything. She never gave an interview. She understood that she just needed to be present.\n\nThis was a woman playing the long game. Headlines came and went.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appears on a large video screen accompanied by Bond actor Daniel Craig during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London. MCT via Getty Images\n\nIf Elizabeth gave a speech, she wouldn’t show any expression, or offer an opinion. This approach meant she retained broad public support, including in parliament, which was the one body that had the power to dethrone her.\n\nIf she had a particular talent, it was knowing when to step in and take center stage. Who can forget her “parachuting” into the London Olympics opening ceremony with James Bond?\n\nAt times of crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, she addressed the country in her role as “Head of the Nation” and expertly articulated the national mood and offered reassurance. She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus and she praised those who had been following government guidelines and come “together to help others.”\n\nEvoking wartime language to place the scale of the crisis in context, she added: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs the lockdown continued in the United Kingdom, the Queen and her family had to find a way to continue to “be seen” when they weren’t able to go out and meet people anymore. So, they did what everyone else did. They video-conferenced into public engagements and released the video to the media.\n\nIt showed a more personal side to the Queen and her family which one doesn’t see when they are surrounded by people and cameras. Photographers were also allowed into Windsor Castle to capture Prince Philip’s funeral, delivering a poignant and profound image of the Queen grieving on her own in the chapel, as she followed social-distancing rules like her subjects around the nation.\n\nIf any monarch’s primary role is to secure and strengthen the Crown for the next generation, then Elizabeth did so with her constant presence, but always adapting and keeping the institution relevant.\n\nOver the course of her long reign, she transformed and updated the brand more than people realize and kept it fit for purpose. It’s up to her heir, an altogether more divisive figure, to honor that legacy and do the same in his own way.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

Today's action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.”\n\nAccording to the DOT, Southwest operated two flights that, between them, experienced 180 disruptions between April and August 2022. The flights operated between Chicago Midway International Airport and Oakland, California, and between Baltimore and Cleveland.\n\nData from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that Southwest was directly responsible for more than 90% of the delays that occurred on those two routes during the period discussed in the lawsuit. The DOT said that its rules \"provide airlines adequate time to fix their schedule after a flight becomes chronically delayed in order to avoid illegal unrealistic scheduling,\" but that Southwest did not address the problem.\n\nThe DOT said in a news release that unrealistic scheduling is \"unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive\" and that it disrupts travelers' plans and allows airlines to capture business by misleading consumers.\n\n\"Continuing to market a flight that has been chronically delayed for more than four consecutive months is one form of unrealistic scheduling,\" the release said. \"Under DOT rules, a flight is chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50 percent of the time. Cancellations and diversions are included as delays within this calculation.\"\n\nThe DOT said it would seek \"maximum civil penalties\" from the lawsuit. According to the Department of Justice, the complaint against Southwest alleges at least 58 violations of DOT's unrealistic scheduling rule, each of which carries a maximum penalty of $37,377. That means the airline could be on the hook for about $2.2 million, depending on how the case is decided.\n\nWhat to know:Southwest Airlines offers a different experience. Here's how it works.\n\nThe release also announced an enforcement action against Frontier Airlines for chronically delayed flights.\n\nThe ultra-low-cost carrier was being fined $650,000, but the DOT said it would only have to pay $325,000 immediately, and the remainder would be forgiven if the airline did not operate any chronically delayed flights in the next three years.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said in a statement that it was \"disappointed\" by the lawsuit.\n\n\"Since DOT issued its Chronically Delayed Flight (CDF) policy in 2009, Southwest has operated more than 20 million flights with no other CDF violations. Any claim that these two flights represent an unrealistic schedule is simply not credible when compared with our performance over the past 15 years,\" the statement said. \"In 2024, Southwest led the industry by completing more than 99% of its flights without cancellation.\"\n\nFrontier Airlines declined to comment.\n\nJetBlue was hit by its own $2 million fine from the DOT for chronically delayed flights earlier this month.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

They’re in it for the business and to make money.”\n\nStarbucks also outlined steps employees should take for addressing disruptive behaviors. Customers are expected to maintain a \"culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,\" according to the policy.\n\nStarbucks employees are instructed to “assess the behavior, not the person,” and given guidance regarding when to talk with a customer about perceived misbehavior versus when to call 911.\n\nDisruptive behaviors include smoking, sleeping and verbal abuse. Workers are told to respectfully request the customer stop the disruptive behavior. Examples of when to call when to 911 include for a robbery, burglary, threat of violence, use of illegal drugs or physical assault.\n\nTwo black men arrested spark change\n\nSeveral Arizona Center Starbucks employees declined to comment about the policy changes, and requested that all questions be directed to their manager, who they said would be available on Monday.\n\nStarbucks officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe chain responded to the outcry in April, announcing that it would close down all of its 8,000-plus company-owned stores in the U.S. along with its corporate offices on May 29 for a day of racial-bias training for staff members.\n\nIn an interview with \"Good Morning America,\" Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, the men arrested at the Philadelphia Starbucks, said they were in the store waiting for a potential business partner and were asked by a barista whether they wanted to order anything.\n\nThey declined and shortly thereafter saw police officers entering the store. The officers eventually arrested the men on suspicion of trespassing.\n\nIn April, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said the incident was not reflective of the brand's mission and values.\n\n\"I'll say the circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome at our store on Thursday were reprehensible,\" Johnson said. \"They were wrong, and for that, I personally apologize to the gentlemen that visited our store.\"\n\nArizona State University’s Taylor Place Starbucks, along with several other downtown Phoenix Starbucks locations, saw a handful of small protests.\n\nThe protesters, chanting \"No Black Bucks for Starbucks,\" accused the company of being racist and encouraged customers to spend their money elsewhere.\n\nFree ASU tuition and a say on Starbucks equity initiatives\n\nStarbucks announced a settlement in early May with Nelson and Robinson.\n\nThe agreement included free tuition for the pair at Arizona State University, a confidential financial settlement and continued discussion of how to prevent \"similar occurrences at any Starbucks location.\"\n\nFollowing the agreement, Johnson, the Starbucks CEO, thanked the men.\n\n\"I welcome the opportunity to begin a relationship with them to share learnings and experience,\" he said in a statement. \"And Starbucks will continue to take actions that stem from this incident to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be.”\n\nRobinson and Nelson said they wanted to harness public reaction on providing opportunities for young people from underserved communities.\n\n\"We all recognize the importance of communication about differences and solutions, and that we will be measured by our action not words,\" Nelson and Robinson said jointly in the statement.\n\nThe men would also offer input on the company's long-term diversity and equity efforts.\n\nLoitering or chilling?\n\nCastillo said he thinks the policy change is a positive thing, and that shops should be more accommodating to customers who want to lounge, especially in Arizona’s summer heat.\n\n“They should change the policy a little bit — let them stay, let them hang around in there,” Castillo said. “At least help provide water or something, in case the customer gets thirsty.”\n\nThere is no Arizona law requiring stores to provide people free water, though many convenience stores in the Valley do not deny people who ask for water. However, there is a state law against recklessly endangering another person, risking their physical injury or imminent death, which has been referenced as reasoning for providing water to a person in need who asks.\n\nGatlin said he thinks the incident in Philadelphia directly spurred this change in policy, and doesn’t completely agree with the shift.\n\n“I think if you’re there for 5 to 10 minutes, it’s fine, but if you’re sitting there for hours, you should have to buy something,” Gatlin said.\n\nReach reporter Angel Mendoza at amendoza@gannett.com, or follow him on Twitter @angelnmendoza_ or on Facebook.\n\nREAD MORE:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/business/starbucks-bathrooms-stores-closing/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Starbucks can't be America's public bathroom | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTwenty years ago, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was under pressure to build more public bathrooms. He responded with an answer that represents how most of the United States has handled public bathroom access for decades.\n\n“There’s enough Starbucks that’ll let you use the bathroom,” he quipped.\n\nAnd in fact, private companies like Starbucks (SBUX) did step in for years to offer their public toilets as local and state governments essentially outsourced a public service to private companies.\n\nStarbucks has at times embraced an open-bathroom policy, and shied away from it at others. Now, the coffee chain is effectively saying it can’t be America’s public toilet any longer.\n\nStarbucks may close bathrooms to the public as part of its efforts to make stores safer. Rob Kim/Getty Images\n\nLast month, Starbucks’ interim CEO Howard Schultz said the company might not be able to keep its bathrooms open, blaming a growing mental health problem that poses a threat to its staff and customers. “We have to harden our stores and provide safety for our people,” Schultz said at a conference. “I don’t know if we can keep our bathrooms open.”\n\nStarbucks’ re-evaluation of its restrooms highlights the pressing need for local, state and federal government to prioritize public bathroom access.\n\n“The commercial solution is really not a great solution,” said Lezlie Lowe, a journalist and author of “No Place to Go: How Public Toilets Fail our Private Needs,” published in 2018.\n\n“It’s leaving what is clearly, without doubt, a necessary amenity for the use of our cities in the hands of private companies. No rational person would want Starbucks to pay for traffic lights or street lights.”\n\nNo place to go\n\nThere aren’t enough places in the United States to go to the bathroom, let alone clean, safe and fully-resourced facilities.\n\nWithout adequate public toilets, people go in places that put them at risk of arrest, jeopardizing public health and adversely affecting neighborhoods’ livability. The lack of public bathrooms is a dire problem for people experiencing homelessness, delivery workers who spend hours on the road, and people with health conditions or disabilities. Women also usually have to wait in longer bathroom lines than men.\n\n“It’s an ongoing sanitation crisis, and it highlights American inequality and marginalization,” Catarina de Albuquerque, chief executive officer of the United Nations Sanitation and Water for All global partnership, wrote in an op-ed this month. “Like food, water and shelter, access to safe sanitation is a fundamental human right.”\n\nIn 2011, de Albuquerque assessed US water and sanitation services for the United Nations and found that, despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, the United States “had woefully inadequate availability of public restrooms” — only eight per 100,000 people on average, the same number as Botswana. Iceland leads the world with 56 toilets per 100,000 people.\n\nPublic bathrooms in the 20th century\n\nThere is no easy answer to how the United States arrived at this conundrum, but public restrooms have long been a political battleground, from segregated Jim Crow facilities to laws that target transgender people.\n\nThe height of the drive to create public bathrooms came during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Before then, public urination was common. In cities, saloons were often the only option.\n\n“Urinating men, like defecating horses, were an everyday sight on the street. ‘Ladies, passing on the sidewalks, are frequently subjected to indelicate displays that they cannot avoid witnessing,’ reported one observer,” wrote historian Peter Baldwin in a 2014 journal article.\n\nA coalition of housing reformers, doctors and public health experts, women’s groups and temperance activists grew concerned about the problems created by a lack of public toilets. The latter’s concerns focused on men who were using saloons’ bathrooms and staying longer to keep drinking.\n\nBefore Prohibition went into effect in 1920, cities raced to build public bathrooms to head off the coming shortage created by the closure of bars, according to Baldwin. In subsequent decades, local governments closed public bathrooms and cut hours due to high maintenance costs, budget shortfalls, crime and other factors.\n\nPrivate businesses then stepped in to fill the void, such as gas stations as more people began to hit the road, fast food chains like McDonald’s (MCD), and eventually companies like Starbucks.\n\nStarbucks’ stance on bathrooms\n\nThe coffee chain has for decades been a solution for those desperate for a bathroom.\n\nIn 2004, a New York Times reporter wrote a tongue-in-cheek guide for people attending the Republican National Convention in New York City. “Public toiletlessness is the shame of the city,” he acknowledged. He recommended the visitors do as the locals do: go to Starbucks.\n\nThat wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for the chain. Starbucks has positioned its thousands of stores as a “third place,” after work and home — a place to grab a coffee on the go, or one where you can sit, sip a latte and bond with friends or strangers.\n\nOpening its restrooms to the public has helped brand Starbucks as a place for members of the community, and is also a great way to bring potential customers through the door.\n\n“Starbucks made money by maintaining bathrooms. They benefited from the absence of government,” said Bryant Simon, a Temple University historian who wrote a book about Starbucks and is currently working on one about public bathrooms.\n\nBut allowing free access to its bathrooms often puts a burden on Starbucks employees. In 2011, The New York Times reported on baristas who went rogue by locking store bathrooms because they were “tired of customers — and noncustomers — leaving bathrooms messy or worse.”\n\nHoward Schultz, Starbucks' interim CEO, has discussed the company's bathroom policy in recent months. Leigh Vogel/Getty Images\n\nThe article noted that “in a city with few other options, people reacted as if Starbucks was revoking a public entitlement.” Starbucks then stepped in, instructing workers to leave the bathrooms open, according to the article.\n\nThe company codified its bathroom policy in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a friend. One of the men said he asked to use the restroom shortly after walking in and was told it was only for paying customers. Minutes later, a store employee called 911.\n\nStarbucks apologized and set up anti-bias trainings for its workers. It also officially informed employees that bathrooms were for everyone.\n\n“Any person who enters our spaces … regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer,” Starbucks said in an email to workers at the time. But the commitment has proved challenging.\n\nThis month, Starbucks said it was closing 16 stores, citing safety concerns. In an open letter outlining the steps Starbucks is taking to try to keep workers safe, members of the US leadership team listed “closing restrooms” as part of the effort. The changes come as Starbucks fights a growing unionization drive.\n\nIn a July memo, Schultz talked about the challenges facing Starbucks and the country overall.\n\n“Our stores serve as windows into America,” he said. “We find ourselves in a position where we must modernize and transform the Starbucks experience in our stores and recreate an environment that is relevant, welcoming and safe.”\n\nIt can’t be left to companies to solve the quandary of public bathrooms, said Temple’s Simon. “Only an invigorated and robust state can solve it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2024/10/02/port-dockworkers-strike-stockpiling-2024/75481058007/", "title": "Port strike: Why are people panic buying toilet paper again?", "text": "Update: US port workers and operators reach a deal to end East Coast strike immediately on Oct. 3. Read more.\n\nDuring her lunch break on Tuesday – the day 45,000 East Coast port workers went on strike – Shayna Turbovsky went to the grocery store to stock up on meat, rice, beans, bananas and toilet paper. She also filled up her gas tank and plans to keep it topped off.\n\nTurbovsky, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, had not been planning to go to the store, but when a co-worker told her she should stock up because there could be shortages and price increases, she decided to go.\n\n\"I don't know how bad it's going to get, but the south east just got smacked by a hurricane and now the supply chain is going to be impacted through this strike...I would rather be overprepared than scared,\" Turbovsky posted on X.\n\nDuring lunch hour Wednesday at a Costco in Arlington, Virginia, shelves normally stocked to the ceiling with paper towels and toilet paper still had supply, but it appeared lower than usual. Meanwhile, at a Los Angeles-area Costco, a worker said there had been a rise in toilet paper sales, though it was nothing close to the pandemonium during the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nToilet paper, paper towels not affected by the strike\n\nBut consumers may be stocking up on the wrong things – and panic-buying when they don't need to.\n\nOn Tuesday, 45,000 union workers went on strike when negotiations for a new contract broke down, shutting down 36 East and Gulf Coast ports. It was the first International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) strike since 1977.\n\nHalf of all U.S. ocean imports flow through the East Coast and Gulf ports, which means consumers may face higher prices and shortages, experts have told USA TODAY. But those shortages would be for items like bananas, alcohol, seafood, electronics, pharmaceuticals, cars, auto parts and machinery parts.\n\n“The work stoppage at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports will not have a meaningful impact on toilet paper supplies. Nearly 90 percent of toilet paper used in the United States is domestically produced, with the majority of imported supplies coming from Canada and Mexico over road or rail,” a U.S. Department of Commerce spokesman said.\n\nAdditionally, officials for President Joe Biden said in a USA TODAY story, the impact on consumers would be “limited,” including “in the important areas of fuel, food and medicine.”\n\nBut some economists have told USA TODAY that each day of the strike could cost the economy up to $5 billion a day as imports and exports are blocked.\n\nConsumer stockpiles to get ahead of the potential scarcity\n\nTurbovsky said she knows that most of the things she stocked up on may not be affected by the port strike.\n\n\"But what I thought in my mind was the pandemic. ... Once people are scared, once this country feels the fear of anything, we will all feel the PTSD of the pandemic, so immediately people think of toilet paper, paper towels, food supply,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\n\"People feel the fear and want to overconsume and buy everything they can.\"\n\nTurbovsky spent $280 on more than 30 pounds of meat to stash in her freezer, along with bananas, which she also froze, and other essentials. Turbovsky said she had a hard time finding meat during the pandemic amid supply chain interruptions.\n\nShe felt guilty buying so much meat, \"but at the end of the day, I slept better at night knowing that I was prepared for the days to come.\"\n\nSupply chain risks different from COVID-19 shutdowns\n\nThe reasons the port strike might cause product shortages differ from those that sparked the shortfalls during the pandemic when there were production shutdowns, said Josh Stillwagon, an associate professor and chair of the economics department at Babson College in Massachusetts.\n\n\"If all of the ports in the U.S. closed and we didn't have the West Coast (ports), I think you'd see something more like that (COVID-19 supply chain interruptions), where you'd have to worry about stockpiling,\" Stillwagon told USA TODAY.\n\nStillwagon believes any strike-related shortages will mirror what occurred in 2021, when ports became congested as supplies started coming back online, delaying deliveries. Depending on how long the strike lasts, consumers should expect to see backlogs in goods arriving as shipments will have to be rerouted to the West Coast, he said.\n\nConsumers will also pay more as transportation costs to get the goods from the West Coast to the East Coast will have to be built into prices, he said.\n\nStillwagon said he understands how consumers could feel uncertainty about the strike, leading them to stockpile goods.\n\n\"People have that ambiguity about what the outcome will be, and so they sort of flock to the necessities that were very inconvenient last time when we didn't have them,\" he said. Concern may also be exacerbated by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has left thousands of people in the East struggling for necessities, \"so people are stockpiling given both of these major news events.\"\n\nPort strike fallout:Will gas prices, supplies be affected by the port strike? What experts say\n\nWhether there will be shortages of goods from the strike depends on how long it lasts, Stillwagon said. Inventories are back to pre-pandemic levels, and suppliers are \"a little more attuned to disruption in the supply chain after COVID, so you may not notice it if it lasts a week or two.\"\n\nNot everyone is stocking up\n\nNot all consumers were panic-buying.\n\nShoppers crowded the aisles at Grosvenor Market in Rockville, Maryland, at lunchtime Wednesday. But that was less about hoarding and more about Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, said Scot Shuck, the store’s owner.\n\nBy midday on Day 2 of the port strike, Grosvenor customers had barely made a dent in the store’s inventory of milk, toilet paper, bread and other staples.\n\nShuck said he hasn't witnessed any of the panic-buying that gripped supermarkets in 2020, at the height of the pandemic. Nor does he expect many supply chain shortages to come.\n\nIf the strike does drag on, Shuck said, the store may have trouble procuring some of his customers’ favorite imports: “Wines, cheeses and, I think, more fruits than vegetables,” he said.\n\nAnd so, Shuck said, “let’s hope that it blows over very quickly.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Josh Rivera, Medora Lee and Daniel de Visé\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

It could lead to raised prices on goods and potentially cause shortages.\n\n“Any strike that lasts more than one week could cause goods shortages for the holidays,” Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, told USA TODAY. “We could get the kind of inflation for six months similar to or worse than peak inflation levels a year ago.”\n\nRetailers, such as Costco, had been shipping months in advance, expediting holiday goods orders ahead of the possible port strike, signaled by a surge in container imports and freight rates in July and August according to news reports, but holiday shopping could be impacted.\n\nConsumers would first notice shortages of perishable products, as grocery aisles could be bare of popular fruits like bananas within weeks, given that about two-thirds of bananas in the U.S. arrive in East Coast ports. Other likely shortages include seafood, electronics, pharmaceuticals, cars and auto parts, machinery parts, and alcohol.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is at the heart of the labor dispute?\n\nUnion workers at ports in the East and Gulf coasts earn a base wage of $39 an hour after six years on the job compared to reports that West Coast union workers, which make $54.85 an hour.\n\nThe International Longshoremen's Association is demanding a 77% pay raise increase over six years and more restrictions and bans on the automation of cranes, gates and container movements used in loading or unloading of cargo.\n\nAccording to news sources, USMX responded with an offer of 40% in wage increases, but the union rejected it, calling the counter “a joke.”\n\nThere hasn’t been an ILA strike against these ports since 1977.\n\nWhat products would be impacted by a port strike?\n\nA port strike will impact vehicle imports, auto parts, machinery, fabricated steel, precision instruments, computers, electronic parts and alcohol - 80% of imported beer, wine, whiskey and scotch and 60% of rum arrive at East and Gulf coast ports.\n\nThe Port of Baltimore, Maryland leads the nation in car shipments. The Philadelphia port leads in fruits and vegetables, New Orleans port brings in coffee and wood products such as plywood.\n\nAgricultural impacts such as the imports of bananas and fruits, coffee and cocoa or exports of soybeans and soybean meal would be felt. However, even more significant impacts would be felt on the chilled or frozen meat products, seafood and eggs, which require refrigerated containers that cannot sit for very long.\n\nThe Port of Wilmington in Delaware is the leading port for Dole Fresh Fruit Co. and Chiquita Fresh North America, getting about two-thirds of all banana imports in the U.S.\n\n“Any fruit that arrives after 1 October will be condemned to the trash can,” Peter Kopke Sr. of Port Washington-based importer Kopke Fruit told The Orange County Register. “And all of the people who have invested in that business will lose a fortune.”\n\nKnitted and non-knitted apparel, furniture, plywood and pharmaceutical products and year-end holiday items would be among the endless list of products impacted by the strike.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/consumers/2025/01/15/starbucks-restrooms-wifi-arizona/77716824007/", "title": "Starbucks is changing its rules around restrooms, Wi-Fi, more.
