The president flew out of Palm Springs International Airport at 3:12 p.m. aboard Air Force One bound for Washington.\n\nGolf in Rancho Mirage dominated Obama's two-day stay. Unlike past visits, there were no known sessions with world leaders and no word of presidential actions taken while here. And at 28 hours from start to finish, it was Obama's quickest visit to the Coachella Valley.\n\nHis itinerary was a shortened version of his three-day visit over Presidents Day weekend in February. The president golfed at the same two courses he did then, first at the Sunnylands estate on Saturday and then Porcupine Creek, the private estate of billionaire Larry Ellison, on Sunday.\n\nResidents have noticed that the president's periodic presence in the valley has become less formal.\n\n\"The first trip he made here, when he was with the president of China, was a little more official. And that did require a little more hubbub,\" said Nelson Durant, one of the neighbors who stood outside the gates of Porcupine Creek to watch the presidential motorcade pass by.\n\nWhen Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Sunnylands in June 2013, the summit gathered worldwide attention. A dinner between Obama and King Abdullah II of Jordan in February 2014 was less substantial but still shined a spotlight on the famed estate and wider valley.\n\nObama, joined for the first and so far only time by First Lady Michelle Obama, returned in June 2014. That trip included an excursion to Orange County for a fundraising and commencement address at the University of California, Irvine. He also spoke by phone to King Juan Carlos I of Spain during that trip, according to White House staff.\n\nIn February, Obama returned for a fourth visit focused around golf.\n\nThis time Obama's Sunday began at about 6:22 a.m. when he worked out at a gym close to Thunderbird Heights, the gated community where's he's also stayed during earlier trips, according to a White House press pool report.\n\nThe unidentified gym was likely at Thunderbird Country Club where the president has worked out before on at least one previous trip.\n\nAt about 8 a.m., Obama's motorcade took him to Porcupine Creek, another course the president has played on multiple occasions.\n\nHe golfed with longtime friends Bobby Titcomb, Greg Orme and Mike Ramos, three former classmates who have joined Obama for previous valley golf trips.\n\nWhile the president may have found a comfortable routine for Coachella Valley visits, having the nation's leader next door is still a novel idea for some residents.\n\nPeople still took the opportunity to see Air Force One fly out of Palm Springs on Sunday, despite afternoon temperatures that gradually rose into the triple digits.\n\nJim Bently began waiting at 12:30 p.m. and found shade under a small tree at The Springs shopping center near Palm Springs International Airport.\n\nBently of Cathedral City expected the president to leave around 1 p.m., but waited until well after 3 p.m. because he wouldn't want to miss out on \"the drama.\"\n\nPeople also gathered at the Palm Springs Air Museum.\n\nLa Quinta residents Vonnie and Roger Ellis said they enjoyed a nice drive and seeing Air Force One before a Father's Day dinner.\n\n\"We are big fans of the president and we love the valley,\" Vonnie Ellis said.\n\nCoachella Valley resident Robert Wolf said he hopes the next president will visit as much as Obama.\n\n\"I hope he comes back next year in his last year or we may never see this again,\" Wolf said.\n\nIf Obama keeps to his routine, he'll be in the valley at least two more times before leaving office, once in February and again next June.\n\nAs the president's motorcade moved west on Dinah Shore Road and turned right onto Gene Autry Trail in Palm Springs, a group of children stood and carried pieces of paper with large black letters spelling out \"Jesus (heart) U\" for Obama.\n\nMotorists who were stopped at the road closure got out to take pictures, although a handful of drivers opted to make U-turns and head in other directions.\n\nA group of people gathered in the parking lot at The Works Floor and Wall. Several of them agreed that everyone should experience seeing the president's motorcade.\n\nCathedral City resident Enrique Chio, 56, waited about two hours with his family. They've all seen Air Force One parked at the airport, but he's the only one to have seen the motorcade during Obama's previous visits and he wanted his family to share the experience.\n\n\"It's pretty awesome to see him come through with his entourage,\" Chio said. \"His limo is solid.\"\n\nBut not everyone could wait.\n\nMario Ureta of Palm Springs and his son waited about an hour before they had to head off to Los Angeles for a birthday party.\n\nUreta, 61, had seen the president's motorcade several times at Los Angeles International Airport, where he works in international logistics. He'd hoped Sunday would be the day his son saw the lineup of vehicles.\n\n\"It never gets old … it gives us chills,\" Ureta said.\n\nReporters Barrett Newkirk, Brett Kelman, Colin Atagi, Denise Goolsby, Rosalie Murphy, Jose Alejandro Bastidas and Emily Donovan contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/13/president-trump-paris/474703001/", "title": "Trump and Macron: Leaders discuss climate, terrorism, Syria", "text": "Jabeen Bhatti, Jane Onyanga-Omara and David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPARIS — President Trump pledged Thursday in the city where the global climate change accord was adopted that the United States would work to protect the environment — even though he withdrew from the pact signed by nearly 200 nations.\n\n\"Our fates are tied together more so than ever,\" Trump said at a news conference following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, one of Trump's harshest critics for backing out of the Paris accord on June 1.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection,\" Trump said.\n\nMacron said while the leaders have a \"number of disagreements\" on the threat of global warming, he respected Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the agreement.\n\n\"Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord,\" Trump said. \"We'll see what happens.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nTrump previously said the agreement is unfair to the U.S. because many energy-related jobs would be lost to meet standards for reducing emissions contributing to climate change. He has called for modifying the agreement, but Macron and other world leaders have rejected that idea.\n\nThe two leaders' meeting and subsequent news conference followed colorful pageantry that welcomed Trump for a two-day visit that includes dinner at the Eiffel Tower Thursday night and commemoration of Bastille Day — France's Fourth of July — on Friday.\n\nDuring a news conference, Macron said he and Trump would work on a \"joint roadmap\" to fight terrorism and post-war initiatives for Syria.\n\nTrump also defended his son’s meeting with a Russian lawyer whom he believed had incriminating information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. \"Most people would have taken that meeting,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It's called opposition research,\" Trump added. \"Politics is not the nicest business in the world.\"\n\nWhen asked about negative comments Trump previously made that \"Paris no longer looks like Paris\" in light of an influx of migrants and a spate of terrorist attacks, the U.S. president changed his tune.\n\n\"You have a tough president. I really have a feeling you will have a peaceful and beautiful Paris,\" Trump said. \"And I'm coming back.\"\n\n\"You are always welcome,\" Macron replied.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump calls Donald Trump Jr's meeting with Russia lawyer 'opposition research'\n\nPresident Trump visits Napoleon's tomb, and social media reacts\n\nEarlier, Trump arrived at Élysée Palace for talks with Macron after visiting Les Invalides, the military museum that is home to Napoleon’s tomb. At least two dozen horses were at the scene and a band played The Star-Spangled Banner as the two presidents walked across a cobblestone courtyard, trailed by a solider carrying a sword.\n\nThe two men paused at the end of the courtyard, where Macron put his hand on Trump's back and pointed up at a columned facade.\n\n\"Melania and I were thrilled to join the dedicated men and women of the @USEmbassyFrance, members of the U.S. Military and their families,\" Trump tweeted with a video before arriving at Les Invalides.\n\nThe first lady visited Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, the country’s largest children’s hospital, and met with senior officials and patients.\n\nAt Place de la Republique Thursday evening, about 200 gathered to listen to speeches, music and protest Trump's visit.\n\nLeticia Alemand, 46, said she came to the protest because she's furious and wanted to show it. I am a human being, and a very angry one,\" she said. \"Macron is the same as Trump – just not blond: He's a puppet of the financial world.\"\n\nThe protest included Americans, like Destini O'Neill who left the U.S. shortly after Trump was elected to seek \"sanctuary\" in France.\n\n\"I'm here today to show solidarity with Paris, and show Paris that Americans also stand up to Trump,\" said O'Neill, 40, of Dallas. \"I'm also here to show Paris that if Trump represents the idiocy of America, then we represent the goodness.\"\n\nTrump will view Friday's Bastille Day parade on the Champs-Élysées, which will include American soldiers marching alongside their French counterparts to mark the 100th anniversary of the United States' entry into World War I.\n\nAnalysts say inviting Trump to take part in such a high-profile and symbolic occasion is a savvy move by Macron.\n\n\"I think it's a very, very clever idea,\" said Joachim-Fritz Vannahme, director of European Policy at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Gütersloh, Germany.\n\n\"I think the best way to get Trump out of his populist campaign mode is really to talk to him — and Macron now has the possibility to set the tone in quite a charming way.\"\n\n\"Macron's idea is to say please come along and let's talk, even if the outcome isn't as we both expect,\" he added.\n\nTwo months after Macron's election, he has set himself up as a global anti-Trump. He has heralded the kinds of multilateral organizations Trump has shied away from and all but mocked the \"America First\" president over issues like climate change with his pledge to \"make the planet great again.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, reportedly told aides he didn't like being \"lectured to\" by the 39-year-old French president. And yet the 71-year-old U.S. president quickly accepted Macron's invitation.\n\nTrump is deeply unpopular in France, not least because of statements deemed insulting to the country. In February in a speech to U.S. conservatives about the importance of border security, Trump said a friend named Jim told him: \"Paris? I don't go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.\"\n\nA poll released in May by Suffolk University found 82% of French people view Trump unfavorably, a stronger disapproval rating than Russia's Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping.\n\nAn opinion poll this week by French broadcaster BFMTV showed that 59% of the French supported the decision to invite Trump.\n\nBastille Day, which falls on July 14, marks the storming of the Bastille fortress that held political prisoners in 1789, which led to the French Revolution.\n\nTrump's visit falls on the first anniversary of the terrorist attack in Nice, in southern France, when an Islamist militant drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring hundreds.\n\nBenjamin Davier, 27, a hotel manager in Nice, said Trump shouldn't have been invited to France.\n\n“Donald Trump doesn’t represent ‘good’ America, in my view, and given his personality, he’s not the best representative we should have on July 14 to celebrate the strong relationship between France and the U.S.,\" he said. \"Americans deserve better.\"\n\nLast week, Trump and Macron both attended the G-20 summit in Hamburg.\n\nOnyanga-Omara reported from London; Jackson from Washington.\n\nContributing: Patrick Costello in Berlin, Elena Berton in Nice, the Associated Press\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nParisians turn up their noses on Trump visit\n\nBastille Day in Nice, France: More anguish than celebration\n\nBlue lobster is on the menu for President Trump's dinner with Emmanuel Macron", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/05/01/hail-chief-sitting-presidents-visited-sd-since-mckinley/26714857/", "title": "Fifteen presidents have visited South Dakota since McKinley ...", "text": "Michael Klinski\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in 2015.

The president attended church at German Congregational Church before riding saddle horses around area farms and up Phillips Avenue. According to the \"Patriotic Pageantry\" book, Roosevelt attended church again Sunday night because local arrangers discovered he was not a member of the German Congregational Church. He then attended service at Livingston Memorial Reformed Church. Roosevelt spent Monday addressing schoolchildren and later about 6,000 people in a speech about the wage worker. The party left Sioux Falls and stopped in Lennox, Yankton, Scotland, Tripp, Parkston, Mitchell, Woonsocket, Alpena, Tulare, Redfield and Aberdeen.\n\nOct. 21-23, 1911 — Returning from a trip to the West Coast, President Taft stopped in South Dakota for three days, arriving in Edgemont on Oct. 21.

Thousands of people greeted Coolidge upon his arrival in Rapid City, and he was at the Game Lodge by 5:30 p.m. on June 15. Most days, Coolidge would be driven from the lodge to his temporary offices in Rapid City. It was there where he announced, on Aug. 2, that he would not run for re-election. But there was time for other activities. At the lodge, Coolidge would fish in a creek that had been stocked with large trout especially for his arrival. The president made several trips in the area, including stops in Belle Fourche, Custer, Nisland, Hot Springs, Pine Ridge, Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore to inaugurate the work on the mountain.

Biden wouldn’t invite Zelensky to Washington – and endure a risky trip outside Ukraine for the first time since the war began – if he did not believe something real could be accomplished meeting face-to-face instead of over the phone.\n\nEmerging from their talks, both men made clear they see the war entering a new phase. As Russia sends more troops to the frontlines and wages a brutal air campaign against civilian targets, fears of a stalemate are growing.\n\nYet as Zelensky departed Washington for a lengthy and similarly risky return trip to Ukraine, it wasn’t clear that a pathway to ending the conflict was any clearer.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nBiden and Zelensky try to figure out how the war ends\n\nGaining clarity on where Zelensky stands when it comes to ending the war was among the prerogatives in bringing him to the White House. The Ukrainian leader had previously expressed a desire for a “just peace” that would end the conflict – a point that US officials said would be at the center of their talks Wednesday.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Zelensky used bellicose rhetoric that suggested such a peace was not close, saying the road to ending the war would not involve making concessions to Russia.\n\n“For me as a president, ‘just peace’ is no compromises,” he said, indicating he doesn’t see any road to peace that involves Ukraine giving up territory or sovereignty.\n\nLater, in his address to Congress, Zelensky said he’d presented a 10-point peace formula to Biden – though US officials said afterward it was the same plan he offered to world leaders at the Group of 20 summit last month.\n\nAmong the Western nations that have rallied in support behind Zelensky, there have been lingering concerns about what Zelensky’s long-term plan might be.\n\nFor his part, Biden said it was up to Zelensky to “decide how he wants to the war to end,” a long-held view that leaves plenty of questions unanswered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky's historic speech to Congress 26:43 - Source: CNN Watch Zelensky's historic speech to Congress 26:43\n\nZelensky shows he knows his audience – and displays his showmanship\n\nZelensky peppered his address to lawmakers with references to American history, from the critical Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolutionary War to the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.\n\nHe delivered his address in English, a purposeful choice he telegraphed ahead of the speech. Even his attire – the now-familiar Army green shirt, cargo pants and boots – seemed designed to remind his audience they were in the presence of a wartime leader.\n\nOver the course of the conflict, Zelensky has demonstrated an acute ability to appeal to his audience, be they national legislatures or the audience of the Grammys.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sought to harness Americans’ emotional response to his country’s suffering, evoking dark winter nights as Russia seeks to interrupt Ukraine’s power supply.\n\n“In two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be – there will be no electricity,” he said.\n\nBut he also seemed aware that many Americans – including some Republicans in Congress – have wondered aloud why billions of US dollars are needed for a conflict thousands of miles away. He sought to make the cause about more than his own homeland.\n\n“The battle is not only for life, freedom, and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer,” he said. “The struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live in.”\n\nHe added, “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky unveil flag during historic speech to Congress 01:59 - Source: CNN Watch Zelensky unveil flag during historic speech to Congress 01:59\n\nZelensky finally accepts the ride he was offered – and gets the ammo too\n\nAt the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Zelensky turned down an American offer to evacuate him from Kyiv.\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US.\n\nTen months later, he got both. When Zelensky touched down outside Washington in a US military plane Wednesday, his arrival capped a 10-day sprint by American and Ukrainian officials to arrange a risky wartime visit meant to rally support for Ukraine’s ongoing resistance to Russia’s invasion.\n\nJust ahead of Zelensky’s arrival, the Biden administration announced it is sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine – including a sophisticated new Patriot air defense system that Zelensky has been requesting for months.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested to advisers he did not want to travel to Washington had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship with the United States, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nYet standing alongside Biden, he was frank that he did not view the single Patriot system as enough.\n\n“We would like to get more Patriots,” he said as Biden laughed. “I’m sorry but we are in war.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This is Vladimir Putin's worst nightmare': Tapper reacts to Zelensky's speech 01:19 - Source: CNN 'This is Vladimir Putin's worst nightmare': Tapper reacts to Zelensky's speech 01:19\n\nA united front in one of the world’s most complicated relationships\n\nSpeaking later to Congress, Zelensky was again up front that he did not believe the American support was sufficient.\n\n“Is it enough? Honestly, not really,” he said of the artillery that the US has so far provided.\n\nZelensky’s candid request for more Patriots – and Biden’s lighthearted response – amounted to a window into one of the world’s most complicated relationships.\n\nOn the surface, Biden and Zelensky have maintained a stalwart partnership. And Zelensky was effusive in his praise of Biden as he went from the Oval Office to the East Room to Capitol Hill.\n\nYet it doesn’t take much to see tensions just beneath the surface. Zelensky has consistently agitated for additional US support, despite the tens of billions of dollars in military assistance that Biden has directed to his country.\n\nThat hasn’t always sat well with Biden or his team. But as he has with a host of other foreign leaders, Biden appeared intent Wednesday on translating physical proximity into a better understanding of his counterpart.\n\n“It is all about looking someone in the eye. I mean it sincerely. I don’t think there is any substitute for sitting down face to face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Listen to Zelensky's message to Americans from Oval Office 06:00 - Source: CNN Listen to Zelensky's message to Americans from Oval Office 06:00\n\nA visit that symbolizes a ‘new phase’ in the war\n\nBiden invited Zelensky to Washington this week because he believes the war in Ukraine is entering a “new phase,” officials said ahead of the visit. As winter sets in and Russia continues targeting civilian infrastructure, the moment seemed ripe for Zelensky to make a dramatic public appeal for continued international support.\n\nYet the new phase isn’t only on the battlefield. Around the world, leaders are confronting the bitter fallout of Russia’s invasion. Higher energy and food prices, in part generated by tough sanctions on Moscow, have caused trouble for politicians in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans poised to take control of Congress have made clear they won’t rubber stamp each of Biden’s requests for Ukraine assistance – though fears funding will dry up completely appear unfounded. Congress is on the verge of approving almost $50 billion in additional security and economic assistance.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers, Zelensky repeatedly referred to members of “both parties,” seeking to frame his cause as a bipartisan one.\n\nStill, some Republicans refused to attend Zelensky’s address to Congress, a protest of what they claim are unrestrained dollars heading out of the US.\n\nIt was against that backdrop Biden insisted US support would continue for months.\n\nHe said it was “important for the American people, and for the world, to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraine’s fight, and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/politics/joe-biden-london-queen-elizabeth-liz-truss/index.html", "title": "Biden in London: Queen Elizabeth II was 'decent, honorable and all ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday paid their respects to Queen Elizabeth II, visiting her coffin lying in state at London’s Westminster Hall and signing condolence books at Lancaster House.\n\nThe President on Sunday said the Queen was “the same in person as her image – decent, honorable and all about service.”\n\n“We’ve had an opportunity to meet with an awful lot of consequential people. But I can say that the ones who stand out in your mind are those whose relationship and interaction with you are consistent with their reputation,” Biden said after signing a condolence book Sunday evening.\n\nBiden, who has often spoken out his own losses, also expressed condolences to the Royal Family and the entire United Kingdom, saying, “It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole, and sometimes you’ll think you’ll never overcome it. But as I’ve told the King, she’s going to be with him every step of the way.”\n\nBiden said the Queen reminded him of his late mother because of her mannerisms, saying, “She had that look, like, ‘Are you okay? Is there anything I can do for you? What do you need?’ Also, ‘Make sure you’re doing what you’re supposed to do.’”\n\nBiden took his time signing a lengthy message in the condolence book, writing in part, “She treated everyone with dignity and respect. Jill and I were honored to have met with her and feel her warmth. Our hearts go out to the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom.”\n\nJill Biden, who told CNN on Sunday she is overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and respect she is witnessing for the Queen in London, signed a separate condolence book for leader spouses at Lancaster House. She wrote, in part, “Queen Elizabeth II lived her life for the people she served with wisdom and grace. We will never forget her warmth, kindness, and the conversations we shared.”\n\nThe Bidens were joined earlier during their visit to Westminster Hall by Jane Hartley, the US ambassador to the UK. The President was seen making the sign of the cross.\n\nThe Bidens also attended a reception on Sunday evening at Buckingham Palace for visiting foreign leaders hosted by Britain’s new king, Charles III.\n\nJill Biden told CNN that her conversations with Charles and the royal family at the reception were strictly about the Queen.\n\n“We really talked about the woman, and who she was, and what she meant really to the whole world,” Biden said, adding that she noted to Charles the human toll of grief.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, signs a condolence book at Lancaster House in London. Jonathan Hordle/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe President arrived in London late Saturday for a two-day visit honoring the long-reigning monarch, whom he says “defined an era.”\n\nBiden is joining leaders from dozens of other nations to pay their respects to the late sovereign, whom he met last year and declared afterward reminded him of his own mother.\n\nFor Biden, it is a moment to reflect on a monarch who embodied a commitment to public service and whose life charted the major historical events of the last 100 years.\n\nBiden and the Queen first met in 1982, when as a young senator, Biden’s own Irish American mother instructed him: “Don’t you bow down to her.”\n\nHe didn’t bow down then, or when he met the Queen as president last year while attending a Group of 7 summit in England. But his respect for a woman whose constancy on the world stage over the last century was unparalleled has been plain.\n\n“She was a great lady. We’re so delighted we got to meet her,” Biden said on the day that she died.\n\nThe Queen’s surprise decision last year to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders at the G7 summit was a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nLater that week, when she hosted Biden and the first lady for tea at Windsor Castle, she inquired about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, the President told reporters afterward.\n\n“I loved her sense of curiosity,” Jill Biden told CNN on Sunday of the time they spent alone with the Queen. “She wanted to know all about American politics, so she asked Joe question after question.”\n\nAt Sunday evening’s reception, the President saw Charles for the first time since he became King. The two men have met previously and spoke last week by phone.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles was a passionate campaigner for certain issues Biden has also championed, including combating climate change. It remains to be seen how involved the new King will be on those issues going forward.\n\nRelatively close in age – Charles is 73, Biden is 79 – the two men have a shared experience of being in the public eye for decades before assuming their current roles as heads of state.\n\nOn his call with the King, Biden “conveyed the great admiration of the American people for the Queen, whose dignity and constancy deepened the enduring friendship and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” the White House said. “President Biden conveyed his wish to continue a close relationship with the King.”\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as Biden and dozens of other world leaders convene to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nWhite House aides have declined to provide specific security details for the President’s visit but say they are working well with their British counterparts to ensure the demands of presidential security are met.\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing US advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nBiden traveled with his national security adviser, communications director and other personal aides aboard Air Force One to London.\n\nWhen reports emerged last week that world leaders would be required to ride on a bus to the funeral, US officials were skeptical and shot down the suggestion Biden that would travel to Westminster Abbey in a coach.\n\nIn 2018, when other world leaders traveled together in a bus to a World War I memorial in Paris, then-US President Donald Trump traveled separately in his own vehicle. The White House explained at the time that the separate trip was “due to security protocols.”\n\nThe Queen’s death came at a moment of economic and political turmoil for the United Kingdom. A new prime minister, Liz Truss, entered office after months of uncertainty following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\n\nTruss invited several visiting world leaders to meet individually at 10 Downing Street this weekend. In the role for only a little more than a week, it will be Truss’ first time meeting face to face with many of her foreign counterparts.\n\nWhile her office initially said Biden would be among the leaders visiting Downing Street, it was later announced that Truss and the President would meet for formal bilateral talks on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nA host of issues are currently testing the US-UK “special relationship,” which has been heralded repeatedly in the days since the Queen’s death.\n\nIt was only two days after Truss traveled to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to formally accept the Queen’s appointment as prime minister that the long-reigning monarch passed away. Since then, the country has been in a formal period of mourning.\n\nTruss inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. The challenges have been aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has caused volatility in oil and gas markets.\n\nWhile few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation– Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\n\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\n\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hard-line approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\n\nBiden, who makes frequent references to his Irish ancestry, has made his views clear on the issue, even though it does not directly involve the United States. Congressional Democrats have similarly expressed concern over any steps that could reignite the Northern Ireland conflict.\n\nIn their first phone call as counterparts earlier this month, Biden raised the matter with Truss, according to the White House. A US readout of their conversation said they discussed a “shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and the importance of reaching a negotiated agreement with the European Union on the Northern Ireland Protocol.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez Allie Malloy", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez", "Allie Malloy"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/04/obama-opens-3-day-foreign-trip-in-sweden/2761313/", "title": "Obama opens 3-day foreign trip in Sweden", "text": "Josh Lederman\n\nAssociated Press\n\nPresident arrived in Stockholm on Wednesday morning\n\nFocus in the Nordic nation will be on climate change%2C trade and technology\n\nObama will later travel to Russia for a Group of 20 summit\n\nSTOCKHOLM (AP) — President Obama is seeking to use a 24-hour visit to this Swedish capital to show a softer side of American diplomacy even as the world's gaze remains fixed anxiously on Syria.\n\nHe intends to focus in the Nordic nation on climate change, trade and technology, a trio of issues on which there is broad consensus with European allies. The topics are a marked departure from the thorny, pressing matters he's facing back home on national security and the economy. He also plans to pay homage to a Holocaust-era hero whose name is commemorated on street signs from Paris to Tel Aviv.\n\nThe president arrived Wednesday morning in Stockholm after an overnight flight from Washington, where lawmakers are weighing whether to approve Obama's request for a military strike against Syria. A day later, Obama was scheduled to travel to St. Petersburg, Russia, to meet with foreign leaders at the Group of 20 economic summit.\n\nGreeting Obama on a mild, sunny morning at the Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport were Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and leaders of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's center-right coalition government.\n\nObama's trip to Sweden will mark the first bilateral visit by a sitting U.S. president to the northern European nation. While in Stockholm, Obama will meet with Reinfeldt and King Carl XVI Gustav and dine with Nordic leaders from Norway, Iceland, Finland and Denmark. He'll also stop at Sweden's premier technical university to call attention to Sweden's goal to phase out fossil fuels by 2050.\n\nThe White House hastily arranged the Stockholm visit after Obama, incensed when Russia granted asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, scrapped a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The cancellation created a two-day scheduling void when Obama was expecting to be overseas but had nowhere to go. The White House added Sweden to his itinerary.\n\nAdministration officials previewing Obama's trip offered little in the way of a specific rationale for the visit, other than to say that the country had extended him a written invitation some time ago. They added that Nordic nations are important partners in development, global security and promotion of democracy.\n\nMany of Obama's global priorities — like energy, global trade and science training — parallel his second-term domestic goals as he seeks to ready the U.S. workforce for a higher-tech economy, increase demand abroad for American products and tackle climate change. But those priorities have at times been overshadowed by global outrage over massive U.S. surveillance programs revealed by Snowden and by Obama's efforts to persuade nations to take a tougher tack against Syria.\n\nA sobering moment was expected Wednesday afternoon when he honors the late Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, credited for saving at least 20,000 Jews during World War II before being arrested by Soviet forces in 1945 and then mysteriously disappearing. Wallenberg's family planned to present a letter to Obama asking for help in pressing Russia to shed light on Wallenberg's fate.\n\nAmid tight security, protesters were already gathering in the streets of Stockholm, including a small group from Amnesty International that held a demonstration outside the royal palace to demand that Obama close Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nThousands of armed police are deployed on city streets, many roads and parks are closed in the downtown area, concrete barriers and steel fences have sprung up in many locations near where Obama will stay.\n\nAssociated Press White House Correspondent Julie Pace and Associated Press writer Karl Ritter in Stockholm contributed.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/07/jimmy-carter-president-death-capitol-live-updates/77481249007/", "title": "Jimmy Carter funeral live updates: 39th president lies in state today", "text": "WASHINGTON - The remains of President Jimmy Carter arrived at the U.S. Capitol for the final time on Tuesday afternoon for a service with members of Congress before the 39th president lies in state.\n\nMilitary personnel carried his flag-draped casket into the Capitol Rotunda for members of Congress and Carter's family to pay their respects at a service before opening up the space to the public.\n\nA crowd formed in the evening to make their way into the Capitol building to pay their final respects to the former president, who served only one term but forged an enduring legacy as a humanitarian.\n\nBitter cold and strong winds off the heels of a massive snow storm made the wait unpleasant.

He grew up in nearby Archery. He attended public schools, went to the U.S. Naval Academy and became a nuclear engineer, serving on the second nuclear submarine. He married Rosalynn Smith in 1946.\n\nWhen his father died, Carter returned home to his family farm and also operated a seed and farm supply company in Plains. He served in the Georgia Senate before becoming governor in 1971.\n\nWho was Jimmy Carter?The 39th president has a long legacy of service\n\nIn 1976, he ran for president as a Democrat and won, beginning his only term at 52 years old. As president, Carter expanded diplomatic relations abroad, invested in the energy sector and increased national park space for Americans. However, he also oversaw inflation and an American hostage crisis that likely cost his re-election, losing to Ronald Reagan.\n\nCarter, after leaving office, conducted humanitarian work around the globe, including with preventable diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to \"find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2023, Rosalynn Carter died at their home in Plains.

Trump is scheduled to cap the stay at a Tuesday night gala at his Mar-a-Lago club hosted by America's Future, a group chaired by former national security aide, Mike Flynn.\n\nAbout 20 people showed up on the route along Southern Boulevard as the presidential motorcade made its way from Palm Beach International Airport to Trmp's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.\n\nTrump's return keeps a streak going. The annual February holiday was one he spent in Palm Beach every year during his first term.\n\nLike his previous visits this month, the president's arrival in his adopted home county came on the heels of another week of breakthroughs and upheaval in the nation's capital.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced he would meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to commence deal-making to end the conflict in Ukraine. That followed Trump securing the release of Pennsylvania teacher Marc Fogel from Russian detention.\n\nThe president also said he envisioned three-way global talks with Putin and China's president, Xi Jinping, while outlining a trade review he expects will bolster his argument for tariffs to upend the current global commerce system. Trump also for pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a move he said was in the interest of national security but critics said would open the door to U.S. corporations bribing foreign officials.\n\nHe also plowed ahead with efforts to dramatically reduce the federal government's workforce, holding a press briefing in the Oval Office with Elon Musk. The billionaire, the world's richest man, admitted that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect\" as Trump sat at the Resolute desk.\n\nTrump called for end to the minting of the penny and recast the board overseeing the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, installing himself and seven other Floridians as trustees. Those include his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Emilia May Fanjul of the Palm Beach County sugar magnate family.\n\n47 in town:Trump scheduled to leave Sunday and attend Super Bowl game in New Orleans\n\nConstitutional experts on the brewing clash between branches of government\n\nThe week began with heightened concern over a clash between branches of government — the executive Trump heads and the judicial that his White House sees as blocking his initiatives.\n\nA series of lawsuits have been filed to prevent a myriad of Trump administration measures to radically shrink the federal government, from international development efforts to Musk's access to the federal payments system to ordering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cease operations. Those legal challenges have found early favor with federal judges assigned to the cases.\n\nOne predominant issue at hand is many of the programs, their funding and the employees Trump seeks to jettison are ones authorized by Congress. The U.S. Constitution grants the power of the purse to Congress, and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 has been seen as a bulwark requiring the executive to honor what Congress has approved and previous presidents have signed into law.\n\nAn equally volatile issue is whether the executive branch can defy an order or ruling by a federal judge.\n\nMusk himself took to his X platform to call for \"an immediate wave of judicial impeachments\" targeting federal judges who block the administration's measures. A statement by Vice President JD Vance claiming judges cannot check the \"legitimate\" power of the executive was \"alarming\" as well, said one constitutional attorney.\n\n\"The warning lights are blinking red there,\" said Stephen Spaulding, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Judiciary Program. \"People need to pay close attention.\"\n\nSpaulding noted that presidents of both parties have assiduously respected and complied with adverse federal court rulings since the Civil War. In 2017, Spaulding noted the first Trump administration acceded when a federal court blocked a travel ban.\n\nSo did the the Biden administration when the Supreme Court halted a student loan forgiveness plan. George W. Bush backed down from assuming broad powers in the war on terror when the courts said no. Richard Nixon relinquished his White House tape recordings when ordered to do so even though it effectively ended his presidency. And Harry Truman quit on seizing steel mills during the Korean War when the high court ruled it unconstitutional.\n\n\"By and large, certainly since the Civil War we have not seen presidents ignore court orders,\" said Spaulding. \"The way to challenge a court order is to appeal it, not defy it.\"\n\nIn addition, with control of the House Senate, scholars and lawyers have said Trump should instead call on his allies in Congress to vote an end to programs and agencies he feels are wasteful and not productive.\n\nTug-of-war between branches not a crisis, expert says, but will Congress defend its prerogative?\n\nConstitutional scholar Kevin Wagner cautions that commentary labeling the legal wrangling a constitutional crisis is way premature. The legal issues at hand, he said, are not as cut-and-dry as the rhetoric suggests.\n\n\"The knee-jerk political part is easy,\" said Wagner, a constitutional scholar at Florida Atlantic University. \"But the actual constitutional questions are more complex.\"\n\nWagner points out the administration is appealing rulings that have gone against the president's wishes. That alone is not unusual, he added, nor is it unprecedented for presidents to rail against judicial orders they object to. He also said there are arguments to be made for more expansive executive authority under the Constitution, though the courts might not agree with that interpretation.\n\n\"That debate, in and of itself, is not a constitutional crisis,\" Wagner said.\n\nIn addition, he said there are laws and authorizations that grant discretion for the executive.\n\n\"Sometimes it's built into the statute. Sometimes it's implied in the statute. Sometimes it's how an agency implements the statute,\" Wagner said. \"And there can be some debates about whether or not that's within the scope of the legislation. Are they allowed to do that? Are they not allowed to do that?\"\n\nAs for flagrant disregarding of court directives, Wagner said that's a \"harder question\" but it's one that is not at hand.\n\n\"I think it's a little early to anticipate that happening,\" he said. \"This tug-of-war isn't inherently a constitutional crisis. It is sort of branches competing against each other and that's been true for a long time. But you can see ways in which this could devolve into a const crisis if it gets there.\"\n\nWagner said, ultimately, it's a battle that historically is resolved when Congress, rather than the courts, \"defends its prerogative\" and powers as set forth in the Constitution.\n\n\"So far, there seems to be less willingness in Congress to do that,\" he said. \"And that has people concerned., But historically Congress does tend to defend its prerogatives. Eventually.\"\n\nDemocrat says colleagues in U.S. House will use their leverage\n\nU.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, told hundreds of constituents listening to a Feb. 10 telephone town hall that Trump's arbitrary orders slashing federal spending are unconstitutional.\n\n\"The president seems to have taken authority away from the Congress,\" she said. \"He's consulted us on nothing. On nothing.\"\n\nFrankel decried the Trump administration's actions. She noted that \"willy-nilly\" laying off federal employees and seeking large reductions in the workforce though buyouts risks disrupting government services, from doling out Social Security checks to processing veterans health claims.\n\n\"There will be a lot of chaos going on that will hurt people indirectly in terms of getting these benefits,\" she said.\n\nThe congresswoman also warned that the ouster of experienced agents and personnel at both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency will put the country's security, and Americans, at risk.\n\nFrankel conceded Trump \"won a big election\" and thus enjoys the \"power of the bully pulpit.\" As a result, Frankel, whose district includes the president's Mar-al-Lago club, said many Republicans in the U.S. House \"are timid about raising voices\" even though they are concerned about the White House's actions.\n\nCapitol Hill Democrats, however, will not remain silent. She said at every level in every single committee they are raising objections and will be filing legislation.\n\n\"Most importantly, when it comes to negotiating the spending budget we will be leveraging our position,\" she said. \"We have never had a budget to fund the government without the support of Democrats. So we should have some important say in what goes into these budgets.\"\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

Carroll\n\nE very day when I drive to work, I pass the church where George Washington worshipped and the street he lived on when he stayed in Alexandria, Va., instead of making the 10-mile horseback ride to Mount Vernon.\n\nI then proceed up the George Washington Memorial Parkway, cross the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River into Washington, and pass the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument and the National Mall, with the dome of the U.S. Capitol dominating the eastern end.\n\nMinutes later (when the traffic is cooperating), I turn for a block onto Pennsylvania Avenue, then swing up 15th Street a block from the White House and cruise past (not through) the Secret Service checkpoint guarding the avenue in front of the White House.\n\nThe landmarks on my way to work are a daily reminder of the history, big and small, made in the nation's capital. They are a reminder, too, of what an honor and privilege it is to cover Washington for The Courier-Journal's readers.\n\nTo be sure, Washington is not to everyone's taste. If politics and government are not a passion, this city can seem both dull and self-important, inaccessible and clubby.\n\nBut politics and government are the business of this town, and that makes it the hub of the nation. And if those businesses have interested you since your teenage years, as was the case with me, then there is no more stimulating, fascinating, infuriating, exciting, frustrating and challenging place to be.\n\nI started in journalism the old-fashioned way: on a bicycle. In the early morning when most people were still asleep, I pedaled through my neighborhood in Toledo, Ohio, delivering the now-defunct Toledo Times.\n\nMy first (and only) effort at alerting Times readers to breaking news came on the morning of June 5, 1968. The Times truck was late for the 4 a.m. paper drop at my house. When the truck finally arrived 40 minutes behind schedule, the driver told me Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy had been shot. I grabbed my transistor radio and, indeed, heard the excited tones of broadcasters confirming the awful news.\n\nI looked at the Times edition I was about to deliver. \"KENNEDY WINS IN CALIFORNIA,\" the headline read, referring to the California presidential primary. That wouldn't do. I tore some of my school notebook paper into strips and wrote on each one: \"RFK SHOT IN L.A. TURN ON YOUR TV OR RADIO.\" I wrapped a strip with my bulletin into each paper. Several customers later told me it was the first they heard of Kennedy's shooting.\n\nAt Boston University, I took my political science courses by day, and worked at The Boston Globe at nights and on weekends, as a copy boy and later as a correspondent. I learned how to work fast and accurately and was schooled by reporters and editors who had covered the \"Boston strangler\" case, the great Brinks hold-up and the rise of John F. Kennedy.\n\nAfter college, I worked at two daily newspapers (both now defunct) in the Boston suburbs and at a Boston all-news radio station owned by CBS News. The intricacies of state and local governments I covered lured me back to BU for a master's in urban affairs.\n\nIn 1977, I went to California and covered state government and politics in Sacramento for The Orange County Register (still publishing!).\n\nAfter 5 1/2 years, another Southern California newspaper, The Long Beach Press-Telegram (still publishing!) tapped me to cover Washington as part of the Knight-Ridder Newspapers (now gone, merged into McClatchy Newspapers).\n\nI arrived on my new job in downtown Washington on June 1, 1983.\n\nRonald Reagan was in the White House, the Cold War was still on, and Democrats and Republicans and Congress fought like cats. At least some things don't change.\n\nI quickly realized Washington required constant study. Reporters here never know when they are going to be covering aviation safety (my second day in D.C.), defense spending, international trade, immigration reform or foreign policy. And then, you need to be able use what we have absorbed to ask reasonably sensible questions.\n\nIt is an intellectually rich environment and it makes reporting here endlessly interesting and fun. No two days are ever the same.\n\nAnd sometimes, they are awkward. I recall a Saturday when I was the only reporter in the Knight-Ridder bureau when the White House alerted us that President George H.W. Bush would soon be in the briefing room for an announcement. My bureau chief told me to hustle over.\n\nSince it was Saturday, I was in blue jeans. But I also hadn't shaved. I looked scruffy. I sat in the second row in the White House briefing room, trying to ask Bush a question. Every time the president looked at me, I could almost see a thought balloon above his head: \"Who the hell is that questionable-looking guy in the second row?\" He didn't call on me.\n\nI joined The Courier-Journal in late 1997. My Washington studies suddenly expanded to include tobacco, coal and the schizophrenic nature of Kentucky politics, which produces Democratic governors like Steve Beshear and Republican leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\nIf there is a persistent theme during my time in Washington, it is confusion. I am not talking about Congress, but about people I meet in Kentucky and in the nation's capital who do not quite understand what I do.\n\n\"I cover Washington for The Courier-Journal in Louisville,\" I say.\n\n\"Oh, so you're in Kentucky?\"\n\n\"No, I am in Washington. I cover issues of interest to readers in Louisville, the commonwealth of Kentucky and Southern Indiana.\"\n\n\"You're in Washington...?!?!\"\n\nWell, look, I don't expect people to read datelines or even bylines for that matter. But the idea behind this little effort is to tell you a little bit about who is behind that \"James R. Carroll\" up there at the beginning of this piece.\n\nMy sister, Nancy, once said to me during a conversation about covering Washington: \"I don't know how you can stand it — listening to the same things day after day.\"\n\nNancy is an actress. I replied that it was similar to what she did, only in her work she said the same things day after day on stage. But she has been honored for her work because she brings something special to each role.\n\nI aspire to bring something special to my role as our readers' eyes and ears in Washington.\n\nSo I relish covering a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, veterans visiting the National World War II Memorial, the infrequent bipartisan congressional agreement that successfully wrestles a problem to the ground, a new face with new promise, or finding a window that opens on the otherwise mysterious ways of Washington.\n\nAnd I still get that jolt of excitement seeing the Capitol and the White House every day on my way into work — and on my way home.\n\nReporter James R.

Church Bells chimed; the pope waved; the crowd roared.\n\nIn his homily, he avoided political issues and spoke instead to Roman Catholics, particularly the many priests, nuns and brothers in his audience, about spiritual issues.\n\nSpeaking in Spanish from a lectern on the high altar of St. Patrick's, the pope focused on a call for \"gratitude and hard work,'' which he called \"pillars of the spiritual life.''\n\nBut he was twice interrupted by loud applause when he praised U.S. nuns, who'd been the subject of a Vatican investigation that Francis closed after taking office in 2013 following the sudden resignation of Benedict XVI.\n\nWhen he was a powerful member of the Vatican Curia and enforcer of church doctrine, Benedict — then Cardinal Ratzinger — was thought to look askance at American nuns who took liberal political and ecclesiastical stands.\n\nHis successor, however, offered \"my special thanks to women religious of the United States. What would we do without you?'' After the applause finally died down, he went on to call nuns \"women of strength\" and \"fighters'' against poverty and for social justice. He told them, \"I love you very much!''\n\nFrancis also cited nuns' role in what he called \"the evolving pastoral landscape'' – which could have been an allusion to the church's worsening priest shortage, or a growing leadership role he envisions for women, or both.\n\nFrancis began his homily with something not in his prepared text – an expression of sympathy to \"our Muslim brothers and sisters\", adding,\n\n\"in the face of the tragedy they have suffered in Mecca.'' He referred to the death off more than 700 in a stampede there.\n\nThe pope reached the cathedral on Fifth Avenue via motorcade after taking a helicopter from Kennedy Airport. Francis flew in from Washington after a two-day visit to the city that included a speech to a joint session of Congress and a visit to the White House.\n\nThe prayer service is the first event on the pope's itinerary in New York, the second city on his U.S. tour. Earlier, he spent the day in Washington where he wrapped up his trip there with an address to Congress and a trip to Catholic Charities.\n\nOver an intense 40 hours set to start with the sunset evening prayer service, he will address world leaders at the United Nations, participate in an interfaith service at the Sept. 11 memorial museum at ground zero and celebrate Mass at Madison Square Garden.\n\nPope departs D.C. after history-making visit; NYC and Philly up next\n\nPope Francis in America\n\nOver the next two days, Francis will address the United Nations General Assembly, visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and celebrate Mass for a congregation of more than 20,000 at Madison Square Garden.\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral is the emotional and symbolic heart of American Catholicism since its completion in 1879.\n\nMargaret Rice and her cousin's daughter Kimberly Uszacki, 15, traveled from Staten Island to see the pope arrive on 5th avenue and 54th Street.\n\nThey arrived soon after security began letting people in at 1 p.m. They waited more than five hours to catch a glimpse of the pope.\n\n\"I thought it was very fulfilling. I got so emotional. It was beautiful,\" Rice said after the pope passed by for a moment.\n\n\"There's so much division,\" Rice said while shedding tears. \"It's just so nice that he's unifying everyone . . . It's a once in a lifetime thing.\"\n\nFrancis touched on another sensitive subject during his homily, expressing sympathy for the church's priests and religious in connection with the clergy sex scandal that has rocked the church. He said they've had to \"bear the shame'' of the misdeeds of \"some of your brothers'' – an apparent reference to priest pedophiles and other wrongdoers.\n\nCiting the Book of Revelation, Francis told his priests, \"you have come forth from the great Tribulation.''\n\nSome advocates for victims of clergy sexual abuse have faulted Francis for such remarks on his U.S. visit, saying that his concern would be better focused on victims, and that he should tell bishops to cooperate more fully with investigations.\n\nWhere is Pope Francis? A schedule of his U.S. visit\n\nHours before the pope's New York City arrival, parts of midtown Manhattan were already locked down with tighter-than-usual security precautions. In addition to the dump trucks, white-painted concrete blocks about 3 feet high enabled police officers to regulate pedestrian access as they stood guard at street corners.\n\nSouthbound Fifth Ave., which runs past the cathedral's main entrance, and northbound Madison Ave., which runs past the rear of the famed house of prayer, would normally be bustling with evening rush hour traffic. But both thoroughfares were locked down before 3 p.m., with no vehicle passage north or south for many blocks.\n\nA metal mesh fence, about 8 feet high, ran along the sidewalks on both sides of Fifth Ave. near St. Patrick's. Inside the fence, hundreds of spectators lucky enough to nab tickets to watch the pope's arrival waited behind additional police barricades hoping for a glimpse of the religious leader.\n\nThe occasion Francis presided over at the cathedral later Friday evening is called vespers, an ancient Christian service of evening prayer. It's usually relatively low-key — there's no communion — but not when the pope comes to town.\n\nNYPD officers 'Pope' and 'Francis' ready for pontiff\n\nUshers wore white gloves and tails. The wand and vessel with which the pope sprinkled holy water on the congregation had been polished to a high gloss. The order of worship included six cardinals and three dozen bishops, many of them from New York City's two dioceses.\n\nAlso invited were many priests, brothers and nuns, including Sister Ellen O'Connor, a hospital chaplain in Yonkers, N.Y., and member of the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious order.\n\nShe said she got in only because someone had an extra ticket, and was thrilled by her good luck. \"It's a gift to be here, to pray with the Holy Father and all these people,'' she said. \"I think it will deepen our understanding of his message of mercy, and of compassion of all of God's creation.''\n\nThe congregation also included donors to the three-year, $175 million restoration of St. Patrick's, a National Historic Landmark. The exterior was washed, including the twin 330-foot spires. Every glass panel in all 75 stained glass windows was cleaned. The great bronze front doors on Fifth Avenue were restored.\n\nFour historic churches wait to welcome Pope Francis\n\nBut the project was not without controversy, particularly in the pontificate of a man who has emphasized humble service to the poor and shunned some of the church's more opulent trappings, such as the papal apartment in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.\n\nAs the work progressed, the archdiocese announced a consolidation plan that closed or merged dozens of parishes across the sprawling 10-county archdiocese. Although Cardinal Timothy Dolan said the closings were prompted largely by a growing shortage of priests, some members of the shuttered parishes accused him of trying to finance the cathedral work on the backs of local churches.\n\nContributing: Kevin McCoy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/24"}]}

We’re speaking of America’s most iconic dog show.\n\nThe 149th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show returned to Madison Square Garden for the first time in five years and one dog stood above the rest. Monty the giant schnauzer was named Best in Show on Tuesday, besting more than 2,500 dogs across 200 breeds during two days of competition.\n\nWestminster history:One dog breaks two droughts with Best in Show\n\nThird time's a charm! Monty, a 5-year-old male from New Jersey, won the Working Group three consecutive times, but fell short of the top honor the two previous times, until now. His win made history. Monty is the first Giant Schnauzer to ever win Best in Show and the first Working Group dog to win Best in Show since 2004, ending the longest drought of any particular group. The winner was selected by Best in Show judge Paula Nykiel out of Washington, Missouri.\n\n\"He always tries so hard. I’m just so proud of him. I call him my Secretariat because he never stops,\" Monty's handler, Kate Bernadin, said after the win, while holding back emotions. \"Puppy did the damn thing.\"\n\nBourbon the Whippet, who came out of retirement at 9.5 years old for the competition, was named the Reserve Best in Show, the runner-up to the greatest dog in America.

The Terrier Group has produced 47 Best in Show winners, the most out of the seven groups. Archer the Skye terrier won the group in his \"retirement show,\" his handler said.\n\nWorking Group: Monty the giant schnauzer\n\nThird time's a charm? Monty, a 5-year-old giant schnauzer from New Jersey, has won the Working Group for the third consecutive time. Can Monty make history? A giant schnauzer has never won Best in Show. The Working Group has won Best in Show 15 times before, most recently in 2004 with a Newfoundland.\n\nSporting Group: Freddie the English Springer Spaniel\n\nFreddie, an English springer spaniel from Milan, Illinois, won the Sporting Group, besting 34 other dogs. The breed excels in hunting and performance and has won Best in Show six times, most recently in 2006. Fun fact: George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, had an English springer spaniel named Millie.\n\nHound Group: Bourbon the Whippet\n\nBourbon the whippet wasn’t originally scheduled to compete this week. The 9-year-old has been retired since 2021, but she came out of retirement on a whim. “Since (retirement) she’s been a mom. She’s had puppies. She’s been our companion and pet. She got here (at Westminster) and she was ready to go, so we decided to give it a go,\" her handler revealed. Bourbon now has a chance at Best in Show. She previously won Reserve Best in Show twice (2020, 2021) at Westminster, but never the main prize.\n\nNon-Sporting Group: Neal the Bichon Frisé\n\nNeal, a bichon frise from Mabank, Texas, won the Non-Sporting Group. A bichon frise has won Best in Show two times, most recently in 2018. Neal is one of 16 bichon frises that entered the competition this year.\n\nToy Group: Comet the shih tzu\n\nA male shih tzu from Monclova, Ohio, named “Comet” topped the Toy Group for the second consecutive year. Shih tzus were first recognized in 1969 and were bred in China, crossing ancient Chinese and Tibetan breeds. Shih tzus in the show ring are known for having long, flowing coats and “Comet” was no exception with his gold, white and silver coat.\n\nHerding Group: Mercedes the German shepherd\n\nMercedes, the German shepherd from Bethesda, Maryland, was named last year's Reserve Best in Show. Mercedes has another chance at winning big after topping the herding group for the second consecutive year. German shepherds have experienced great success at Westminster with wins in the Herding Group in 2016, 2017, 2022, 2024 and now 2025.\n\nWhat is the 2025 Westminster dog show schedule?\n\nTuesday, Feb. 11: Preliminary judging continues in the remaining three groups (Javits Center), with the top finishers advancing to the Best of Breed competition (Madison Square Garden).\n\nBest in Show honors will be announced after the judging concludes on Tuesday night.\n\nDog Show Day 2\n\n8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ET, Jacob K.

Group winners then move on to the Best in Show category. — Steve Gardner\n\nWho won Best in Show last year?\n\nSage, the miniature poodle, won the Best in Show honor at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show last May, beating over 2,500 dogs of more than 200 different breeds for the ultimate prize.

Tibetan Mastiffs are described as a “very stubborn” breed, which some would use to describe his namesake.

Autumn \"Sonnet\" the German Shorthaired Pinter finished in second place, followed by \"Accelerate\" the Chesapeake Bay Retriever and \"Cutter\" the Labrador retriever.\n\nA Black Cocker Spaniel has won Best in Show two times in Westminster history when \"My Own Brucie\" won the honor back-to-back in 1940 and 1941.\n\nMartha Stewart: Westminster Dog Show superfan\n\nMartha Stewart is quite the animal lover.\n\nLess than two weeks after giving the “Riders Up” call at the 150th Kentucky Derby in Louisville, the legendary businesswoman dropped by the 148th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York. (Fun Fact: The Westminster Dog Show is the second longest continuously held sporting event behind only the Kentucky Derby.)\n\nBack to Martha ... The mother to five canines said she loves coming to the dog show “to see the best of the best.” And she has past experience. In 2012, her late Chow Chow Genghis Khan won “Best in Breed” at the Westminster Dog Show that year.\n\n“I try to make it an annual event because I really do love beautiful dogs… I see breeds I’ve never seen before,” she said. “My dogs are at home. I have two Chow Chows… and I have three (French Bulldogs). I think I have a ‘Best in Show’ at home right now, Luna Moona, my newest Frenchie. She’s coming. Watch out.“\n\nHow to watch Westminster Dog Show 2024\n\nThe Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show concludes Tuesday night and will run from 7:30 p.m. ET until 11 p.m. The event will be broadcast live on Fox Sports 1.\n\nWestminster Dog Show live stream\n\nStreaming for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show will be available on FS1 Live and the Fox Sports app. Streaming is also available onFubo (regional restrictions apply).\n\nWestminster Dog Show schedule\n\nPrior to Best in Show judging, which will take place at the end of the event, the Sporting, Working and Terrier Groups will judged.\n\nWestminster Dog Show groups\n\nDogs are divided into seven different groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting and Herding.\n\nHow does the Westminster Dog Show work?\n\nEssentially, dog shows evaluate what is known as conformation, or a particular purebred dog’s adherence to its breed standard. There are 212 breeds of dog currently recognized by the American Kennel Club; those are divided into seven different groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, Herding.\n\nDogs first compete among their own breed to select a Best of Breed or Best of Variety champion. The judges select the winner that most closely adheres to its breed standard, which is written and maintained by the national breed club, and then later approved by the AKC.\n\nOnce all the Best of Breed champions are crowned, those then compete against the other dog breeds in their respective groups. The group judge will then assess all the different Best of Breed champions to come up with four placements, with only the group winner advancing to Best in Show judging.\n\nAll seven group winners advance, and the Best in Show judge will assess the group winners to come up with Reserve Best in Show — or the runner-up recognition — and Best in Show, the top prize.\n\nThe 2024 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is taking place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, N.Y.\n\nBest of Show at Westminster in 2023\n\nAt the 147th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, “Buddy Holly” made history. A six-year-old Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen (PBGV), he became the first of his breed to ever win the coveted Best in Show recognition in Westminster.\n\nTo get to Best in Show, “Buddy Holly” had to top 402 other dogs across 34 different breeds to win the Hound Group. Prior to his triumph, PBGVs had only one Hound Group win in Westminster, back in 2007.\n\n“Buddy Holly” is from Palm Springs, California, and is owned by Janice Hayes. The American Kennel Club recognized PBGVs in 1991. They are shaggy-coated rabbit hunters originating from Vendée, France, on the country’s western coast.\n\nReserve Best in Show, or the runner-up award, at the 2023 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show went to “Rummie” the Pekingese.\n\nWho won Westminster Dog Show Toy Group?\n\nA 3.5-year-old male Shih Tzu from Monclova, Ohio, named “Comet” topped the 24 other dogs entered in the Toy Group on Monday night.\n\nShih Tzus were first recognized in 1969 and were bred in China, crossing ancient Chinese and Tibetan breeds. Shih Tzus in the show ring are known for having long, flowing coats and “Comet” was no exception with his gold, white and silver coat.\n\nWho won Westminster Dog Show Hound Group?\n\nA six-year-old Afghan Hound named “Louis,” hailing from Roseville, California, won the Hound Group Monday night, topping 34 other dogs in the process.\n\nOne of the oldest dog breeds on record, going back to around 4,000 B.C., Afghan Hounds were first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1926. They are known for their long, flowing coat, but they served as hunting dogs in harsh, mountainous climates.\n\n“Louis” wowed judges and fans with a silky, black coat, with a white tuft on his chest.\n\nWho won Westminster Dog Show Herding Group?\n\nContinuing a recent run of success for German Shepherds in Westminster — with wins in the Herding Group in 2016, 2017, 2022 and now 2024 — “Mercedes” advanced Monday night.\n\nA four-year-old female from Bethesda, Maryland, “Mercedes” beat out 32 other breeds in the group.\n\nGerman Shepherds are one of the most popular dogs in the U.S., ranking fourth in popularity in 2023, according to the American Kennel Club, which first recognized the breed in 1908. They were originally bred as sheep herding dogs in Germany.\n\n“Mercedes” is the cousin of “Rumor,” the German Shepherd who won Best in Show in 2017, also handled by Kent Boyle.\n\nWho won the Westminster Dog Show Non-Sporting Group?\n\n“Sage,” a three-year-old miniature poodle from Houston prevailed over the 20 other dogs in the Non-Sporting Group Monday night.\n\nAnother well-known breed, ranking seventh in popularity according to the American Kennel Club, the miniature poodle was first recognized by the AKC in 1887. “Sage” is all black and sported a coiffed haircut complete with sculpted bracelets on her wrists.\n\nPoodles come in three sizes (standard, miniature or toy) and are the national dog of France.\n\nWestminster Dog Show agility 2024 results\n\nIf there was ever a name that fit a dog, it was “Nimble.” The All-American dog became the first mixed-breed dog to win the agility championship the Annual Masters Agility Championship in Westminster.\n\n“Nimble” completed the obstacle course in 28.76 seconds, which was the third-fastest time in the 11-year history of the event and only the fifth time that a dog has completed the course in fewer than 30 seconds. The obstacle course includes various ramps, agility poles and jumps that each contestant must work through, with the fastest time winning.\n\nCynthia Hornor of Ellicott City, Maryland is “Nimble’s” owner. And while it was “Nimble’s” first agility championship, this marked the second consecutive agility title for Hornor, whose border collie, “Truant,” won in 2023 with a time of 28.68 seconds.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2025/02/12/2025-westminster-dog-show-photos/78451839007/", "title": "2025 Westminster Dog Show: See photos", "text": "All good things must come to end.

You don't want him to suffer,\" said co-owner Stephanie Schrock, a retired vet tech from Milton, Delaware. \"For half an hour, we thought about whether we needed to euthanize him, trying to come up with the right decision.\"\n\nCome Monday morning, his road will be a lot smoother - he'll step onto the carpeted ring at the Westminster Kennel Club, showing not a scratch from his 2014 wreck.\n\nThere are 2,882 entries at America's most prestigious dog competition, plenty of them favorites.

A border collie, Fame(US), won the championship.\n\nRumor the German shepherd won last February, and then she retired. That leaves a clear path for 5-year-old Fanucci, named for a character in \"The Godfather Part II\" and considered by many the best of his breed in the nation.\n\nHe's already twice competed at Westminster, once taking home an award of merit. It's been more than a century since two different dogs of the same breed have won this show.\n\n\"If he never does anything in his career, he's done more than you ever have imagined,\" said handler Sue Condreras, a physician's assistant from Farmingville, New York.\n\nBack around Labor Day 2014, Fanucci was off to a fast start. He'd won two herding groups that weekend and was riding with a pack of dogs inside a van that stalled.\n\nIt was hot, and co-owner Leslie Dancosse made sure to crack the window before climbing into the tow truck. They were headed to a garage, going 60 mph or so, when a car suddenly waved them down.\n\nThe driver's words nearly paralyzed Dancosse: \"A German shepherd just jumped out of the van!\"\n\nFrantically, she ran back more than a mile along the highway and found a woman, herself in a full leg cast, cradling Fanucci in a blanket.\n\n\"He tried to get up. He couldn't. There was blood everywhere,\" Dancosse said.\n\nSomehow, perhaps unnerved by the clanks and clunks, Fanucci had escaped his crate, pulled down the window and leaped out. He didn't get hit on the highway, but landed hard and was in rough shape.\n\nHis right rear leg was dangling, as badly broken as anything Dr. Guy DeNardo had ever seen at the Valley Central Veterinary Referral and Emergency Center in Whitehall, Pennsylvania. Surgery took five hours or so, cost about $10,000 and included rods, pins, screws and wire.\n\n\"It was in quite a few pieces. It truly was a puzzle to put back together,\" he said.\n\nDeNardo's prognosis: Fanucci would eventually walk, \"but to make it back into the show world, that might've been doubtful.\"\n\nSaid Condreras: \"But nobody told Fanucci this, that he wouldn't show again.\"\n\nOver several months, rounds of acupuncture, chiropractic care, massages, physical therapy and road work got him moving again. Within a year, he began competing again. And winning, too.\n\nNow, he's ready to possibly to take his biggest steps yet.\n\nSchrock has never been to Westminster. She'll be there this time.\n\nIf Fanucci earns a place in the best-of-seven final ring, DeNardo also would like to attend.\n\n\"I do remember this one, piecing that thing together,\" he said. \"I remember saying that if he ever makes it back, I want to know.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/12/elon-musk-trump-doge-marc-fogel-winter-weather-measles-dog-show-pete-davidson/78447972007/", "title": "Elon Musk, DOGE, Trump, Russia, Marc Fogel, winter weather ...", "text": "President Donald Trump, joined by Elon Musk in the Oval Office, ordered up big cuts in the federal workforce.

And they are 13 to 23 years old.\n\nBut a new Harris Poll that surveyed all generations found that more than half of Gen Z – 56% – consider themselves creative, compared to 44% of those over the age of 24.\n\nWhen asked about the activities, behaviors and conditions that help generations of people achieve peak creativity, this generation outmatched all others, the survey conducted on behalf of Adobe found, thus dubbing the Zers a nickname: Generation Create.\n\n\"What we found is that Gen Create are digital natives who are also more creatively inspired by family, friends and love more than any other generation,\" Adobe said in its study. \"And they are likelier than any other generation to say that both social media and social activism make them more creative.\"\n\nGen Zers are those born after 1996 and combined with Millennials, ages 24 to 39, the two generations make up most of the U.S. population, according to a 2019 analysis by the Brookings Institution that showed 50.7% of U.S. residents were under age 40.\n\nGrowing up in the technology era, \"Gen Create\" is more inspired by music, social media and social connections, the survey found.\n\nAnd they believe they are the most creative generation: Gen Zers surveyed said that 23 years old is the age for peak creativity in a person's life. Other generations – Millennials (ages 24-39), Generation X (ages 40-55), Baby Boomers (ages 56-74) and the Silent Generation (ages 75-92) – believe 35 is the optimal age for creativity.\n\nThe 2020 poll surveyed 5,000 participants of all generations across five countries, including the U.S., the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and Australia. Among the key findings:\n\nWhile the top 10 activities that make Gen Z feel creative are similar to other generations (listening to music, cooking, spending time alone), the survey found Gen Z replaced meditating with gaming in their top 10. Gaming has twice as strong an impact on Gen Z’s creativity than other generations at 29% versus 13%.\n\nMusic is more likely to have an impact on Gen Z's creativity than other generations: 67% of Gen Z say music is their primary mode of inspiration, compared to the 56% of all other generations.\n\nCooking is the second highest ranked activity that inspires creativity among all generations, but 62% of Gen Z said it makes them feel more inspired, compared to 56% in other generations.\n\nthat inspires creativity among all generations, but 62% of Gen Z said it makes them feel more inspired, compared to 56% in other generations. Gen Z are significantly more likely to do something creative every day by 63% compared to 57% among other generations and are also likelier to say that doing something creative daily benefits their work/academic studies by 78% versus 63%.\n\nSocial media is an inspirational outlet among Gen Zers, 47% of whom say that checking social media makes them more creative, compared to only 30% of people ages 24 and up.\n\nIn the U.S., Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse generation, according to the Pew Research Center. A slight majority of Gen Zers, 52%, are non-Hispanic white, while 25% are Hispanic, 14% Black, 6% Asian and 5% are another race or two or more races.\n\nGeneration Z is also known for political engagement and activism not seen since the 1960s, and they're particularly concerned with climate change and its threat to the future. Gen Zers are responsible for having sparked protests globally, such as the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, Youth for Climate and #FridaysForFuture demonstrations.\n\nThe Harris Poll found that 56% of Gen Zers agree that social activism is the most important issue to them compared to 47% of people ages 24 and above.\n\nBut the oldest Gen Zers face uncertainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Unlike the Millennials – who came of age during the Great Recession – this new generation was in line to inherit a strong economy with record-low unemployment,\" according to the Pew Research Center. \"That has all changed now, as COVID-19 has reshaped the country’s social, political and economic landscape. Instead of looking ahead to a world of opportunities, Gen Z now peers into an uncertain future.\"\n\nIn the midst of global coronavirus shutdowns, the Harris Poll found that Gen Z is significantly more likely to play an instrument, sing or take \"brain breaks\" while working (or studying) from home, with 23% of Gen Z, 15% of Millennials, 13% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers reporting that music stimulates their creativity.\n\n\"We’re just starting to understand this next generation – 13 to 23 year-olds,\" Adobe said in its report. \"But we’ve seen that they use creativity in their daily life more than any other generation.\"\n\nClimate change the new Vietnam War?Generation Z poised to change US politics with activism\n\nMore:Millennials, Gen Z and younger generations are the new majority in the US.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/23/election-2024-live-updates-harris-trump/75798623007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Trump courts Christian voters, Harris sits for ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the2024 election from Wednesday, Oct. 23. For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Thursday, Oct. 24.\n\nIt's 13 days to Nov. 5 − Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing on two pivotal swing states on Wednesday: Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris will take questions from voters at a town hall event in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, moderated by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. Trump is holding multiple events in Georgia, including a town hall focused on faith in Zebulon, and a rally in Duluth.\n\nGeorgia and Pennsylvania could easily decide the race for the White House on Nov. 5. President Joe Biden picked up the states in 2020, but Trump won both in the 2016 election.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage.\n\nHarris grabs narrow lead in Michigan, tied with Trump in Wisconsin, new polls show\n\nKamala Harris is narrowly leading Donald Trump in Michigan and is tied with the former president in Wisconsin, according to a pair of battleground state polls released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University that suggest momentum for the Democratic nominee.\n\nWith 13 days until Election Day, Harris leads Trump 49%-46% among likely voters in Michigan, the Quinnipiac poll taken Oct. 17 to 21 found. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West each received support from 1% of likely voters.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Harris and Trump are tied at 48%, according to a separate Quinnipiac poll of 1,108 likely Wisconsin voters taken during the same time frame.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHarris' closing argument will be at National Mall\n\nKamala Harris will deliver a \"closing argument\" for why she believes she should be voters' choice in the 2024 election on the National Mall next Tuesday, according to a senior campaign official.\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor, will make the case for the country to turn the page away from former President Donald Trump at the Ellipse, which is the same place he delivered a fiery speech nearly four years ago before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capital on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe VP is using the symbolic venue to make a call for voters to end Trump’s \"era of chaos and division,\" and talk about how she will pursue a new way forward, the Harris campaign official said.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump: Biden's 'stupid statement' is proof of persecution\n\nPresident Biden Tuesday said, “We’ve got to lock him up,” in regards to Trump. The former president jumped on the statement at a rally in Georgia Wednesday evening, claiming Biden’s comment proves political persecution.\n\n“As I’ve said these lawsuits are being run by the Department of Justice, the FBI, Biden is behind it all, believe it or not, and he proved that yesterday with his stupid statement,” said Trump, who was convicted in May on 34 felony counts by a New York jury.\n\nTrump also faces multiple counts in three other cases involving his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents after he left office. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nBiden and Democrats have been careful to avoid commenting on Trump’s legal woes.\n\nAfter his initial comment to campaign workers in New Hampshire yesterday, Biden quickly clarified, “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Michael Collins\n\nHarris agrees with ex-chief of staff who says Trump is a 'fascist'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday that she believes that former President Donald Trump is a fascist, and his ex-chief of staff is \"putting out a 9-1-1 call\" to the American people to consider the implications of his potential return to the White House.\n\nAppearing at a CNN town hall in a Delaware County in Pennsylvania, Harris invoked former White House chief of staff John Kelly's claim that Trump made positive comments about Hitler. And she agreed with Kelly's assessment that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.\"\n\nHarris was responding to a question from Anderson Cooper, who asked her how she plans to convince millions of Americans that Trump made the comments.\n\nTrump's campaign has denied Kelly's account, and the former president assailed him on social media.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is, the people who know Donald Trump best . . . have all called him unfit and dangerous,\" Harris said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nColorado man pleads guilty for threatening election officials, judge\n\nA Colorado man pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials as well as a Colorado state judge from 2021 to 2022.\n\nIt marks the latest in a string of convictions secured by the Justice Department's election threats task force against threats to election personnel that cross state lines. Teak Brockbank, who also admitted he illegally possessed multiple firearms, posted on social media in 2021 that a Colorado election official \"has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.\"\n\nIn the same post, Brockbank pledged there would be accountability \"for these peoples actions,\" saying it would come from him or from others who \"understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\"\n\nThe election threats task force also brought charges against two other men on Monday, one for allegedly threatening an election official in Florida and the other for allegedly threatening a Pennsylvania political party representative who was recruiting poll watchers. An Alabama man was sentenced Monday to 30 months in prison for threatening Arizona election workers with violence in 2022, during and after that state's primary elections.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRFK Jr. criticizes Kamala Harris, rejects John Kelly allegations\n\nDonald Trump has not acknowledged recent comments by his former chief of staff, John Kelly, who alleged to The New York Times that Trump has “fascist” traits and made positive remarks about Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nBut Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is talking about Kelly.\n\nThe former presidential candidate called Kelly a “liar” and said the former Marine Corps general “invented” stories about Trump, while on stage in Duluth, Georgia, ahead of Trump’s appearance there this evening.\n\nKennedy also criticized Harris for “repeating these irresponsible stories.” The vice president earlier today gave a brief address from Washington regarding Kelly’s statements.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJason Aldean introduces Trump at Georgia rally\n\nCountry singer Jason Aldean took the stage to introduce Trump at a rally in Duluth, Ga., on Wednesday night.\n\nAldean, a Georgia native who was also spotted sitting next to Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, touted his friendship with the former president.\n\n“He’s a president who when knocked down, gets back up, raises his fist in the air and says ‘fight,’” Aldean said, referring to a now infamous photo of Trump surviving the first assassination attempt against him. “And to me that’s a warrior, that’s who we need running this country right now.”\n\nThe singer emphasized Georgia’s swing state status, telling the crowd that “every vote is necessary, so do not sit this one out.”\n\nAldean and his wife have long ties with Trump. He defended the former president on social media earlier this year after Trump was criminally convicted.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nMankind vs. The Undertaker: WWE wrestlers weigh in on 2024 'Electionmania'\n\nWWE wrestlers the Undertaker and Mankind duked it out in a famous steel cage match in 1998 that left the wrestlers bloodied, and even one of them with broken bones.\n\nBut this time the fight is outside the ring – and will take place at the ballot box. Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, on Wednesday endorsed Kamala Harris after WWE legend The Undertaker endorsed Donald Trump over the weekend.\n\n“I think it's important for everyone to have a moment where enough is enough,” Foley said in a roughly 4-minute long video posted on YouTube. “For me, enough was enough eight years ago.”\n\nTrump appeared on The Undertaker’s podcast, “Six Feet Under,” where the two spoke about realities of professional wrestling. The Undertaker, whose real name is Mark Calloway then endorsed Trump in a TikTok video on Sunday, alongside other former WWE wrestler Glen Jacobs, who played “Kane,” The Undertaker’s on-screen brother.\n\nFormer professional wrestling stars have played a role in Trump’s reelection campaign. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\n\nTrump, who is a member of WWE’s Hall of Fame, has long been associated with the professional wrestling company – even making his way into the ring in 2007 to feud with Vince McMahon, the former CEO of the company. McMahon is currently facing a federal investigation after a sex trafficking and sexual misconduct lawsuit was filed against him earlier this year. Linda McMahon, wife of Vince McMahon, served in the Trump administration as head of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump courts Christian voters at Georgia 'Believers' town hall\n\nTrump used a town hall focused on faith in Georgia to make a special request to Christian Americans: Vote.\n\n\"Christians are not tremendous voters,\" Trump said during a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall\" in Zebulon, Georgia.\n\nTurnout could make all the difference in Georgia, a major battleground state. Neither candidate currently holds a clear advantage in the Peach State; Trump led Harris by seven percentage points in a Quinnipiac poll last week, while Harris was up by four points in a Washington Post-Schar School survey released Monday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also made an appeal by talking about his own beliefs.\n\n“When you have faith, when you believe in God, it’s a big advantage over people that don’t have that,” he said.\n\n− David Jackson and Savannah Kuchar\n\nAsk us anything!

The imagery appeared on Oct. 19, the first day of in-person early voting in Nevada.\n\nEarly voting runs through Nov. 1 in Nevada, a state in which all registered voters get mailed a ballot. They can return the ballot by mail or put in a ballot drop box.\n\nUnregistered voters in Nevada can register the same day, however since it's after Oct. 22, they must vote in-person at a polling place and show their valid Nevada driver’s license, Nevada ID card, or tribal ID to vote.\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nRussian smear of Tim Walz hits internet ahead of US election\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say Russia is behind a fake video smearing Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz with false sexual abuse allegations as part of an election interference effort favoring Donald Trump that will continue after Nov. 5.\n\nThe content, including baseless allegations from the Minnesota governor’s time as a high school teacher, was fabricated and then boosted online and across social media by operatives working for the Kremlin, said an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\"The intelligence community assesses that Russian influence actors created and amplified content alleging inappropriate activity committed by the Democratic vice presidential candidate during his earlier career,\" the ODNI official told reporters Tuesday.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\n‘It’s not that hard to vote’: Barack Obama appeals to young voters in NBA podcast\n\nDuring an appearance on “The Young Man & the Three” basketball podcast, former President Barack Obama urged young people — specifically addressing young, male voters — to vote in the upcoming election.\n\n“I think that’s the main message that I have for folks,” Obama said during the episode, “it’s not that hard to vote.”\n\nObama has been on the campaign trail, stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee opposing former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. With the general election fewer than two weeks away, Harris and the Democrats have been trying to reach young men of color.\n\n– Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTrump headed to Madison Square Garden on Sunday\n\nWhile he officially changed his residence to Florida years ago, former President Donald Trump spent decades living and building his real estate empire in New York City and is returning Sunday for a big rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHome court for the New York Knicks and home ice for the New York Rangers, the iconic venue is also known for staging big concerts and boxing matches.\n\nBut on Sunday at 5 p.m. it will transform into MAGA central as Trump diverts from the swing states to stage a rally in a blue state that is deeply associated with his rise to fame and political power.\n\n- Zac Anderson\n\nGeorgia audit finds only 20 noncitizens of 8.2 million registered voters\n\nA state audit uncovered fewer than one in 400,000 registered voters in Georgia who were noncitizens, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced Wednesday at a press conference. The audit by Raffensper's office found just 20 noncitizens among more than 8.2 million registered voters.\n\n“This is the most comprehensive citizenship check conducted in the history of Georgia, if not the most comprehensive check ever conducted in the United States of America,” Raffensperger said.\n\nThe registrations were canceled for all 20 noncitizens, who have been referred for potential criminal prosecution, Raffensperger said.\n\nThe 20 individuals were found through affidavits they submitted to get out of jury duty, according to Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office.\n\n\"One of the reasons the secretary ordered this noncitizenship audit is to prove to people that, while there are ways that some can potentially get on, it is ceasingly rare,” Sterling said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris calls ex-aide's fascism warning a 'window into who Donald Trump really is'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of wanting \"unchecked power\" as the Democratic nominee seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump's former White House chief of staff, who warned Trump would rule like a dictator in a second term and recounted his past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him, side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room,\" Harris said in remarks Wednesday from the vice president's Naval Observatory residence in Washington.\n\n\"The bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants,\" Harris continued. \"He wants unchecked power. The question in 13 days will be: What do the American people want?\"\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\nOver three recorded interviews with the New York Times, Kelly said Trump, the 2024 Republican nominee, met the definition of a fascist, would govern like a dictator if allowed, and had no understanding of the Constitution or the concept of rule of law.\n\n\"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,\" Kelly told the Times. \"So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.”\n\nHarris also referenced a separate report from the Atlantic, which quoted Trump saying that, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" according to two unnamed individuals.\n\nThe Trump campaign has denied Kelly's accounts and the Atlantic story.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, slammed Kelly’s accounts as “debunked stories” and said he had “beclowned” himself in a statement to the Times.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nJD Vance in Las Vegas urges supporters to vote with family, friends\n\nRepublican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance implored supporters during a Las Vegas rally on Tuesday to use methods of voting – including early in-person and by mail – that Republicans once criticized as ripe for fraud.\n\n“If Kamala Harris's team is using everything and we're only using one of those methods of voting, then we're going to get killed,” Vance told the crowd.\n\nDonald Trump, Vance’s running mate, attempted to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in voting during the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “a whole big scam.”\n\nThis year, the Trump campaign has sought to walk back some of that rhetoric.\n\n“However you can – early, voting by mail, early in person, going on election day -- whatever makes the most sense to you. Get out there and let's try to bank as many votes by election day as possible,” Vance said on Tuesday.\n\nHe also joked that Trump supporters should “vote 10 times, the legal way” by bringing their friends and family with them to the polls.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nElection certification, inauguration to have heightened security\n\nBoth Jan. 6 and Jan. 20 will be treated as National Special Security Events, the U.S. Secret Service confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nThe results of the presidential election are certified in the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 and the next president-elect will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20.\n\nA National Special Security Event is an event that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has deemed nationally or internationally significant and could be a target for terrorism or criminal activity, and enhanced security is likely.\n\nInaugurations, State of the Union addresses, the United Nations General Assembly and both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are typically considered National Special Security Events. The 2024 NATO Summit held in Washington D.C. was also considered such an event.\n\nThe Secret Service could not confirm media reports that fencing would be erected around the Capitol complex from Jan. 5 to Jan. 20, said USSS spokesperson Nate Herring.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol building, an eight-foot-tall metal fence was erected around the complex and stayed up for months.\n\nThe National Park Service has already put up partial fencing near the White House that will stay up through February 2025. Preparation began a month earlier this year, according to NPS.\n\n-- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump's plan for Election Day? Campaign readies for a party in Florida.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to have his election night party in Florida in the Palm Beach area, according to two sources familiar with the GOP campaign's planning.\n\nThat likely means Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, with a Republican operative close to the campaign saying they are \"pretty sure that's where everyone\" will be on Nov. 5. The election night party could be at another venue, or spread across multiple venues, though, sources said.\n\nTrump was in New York City on election night in 2016 and the White House in 2020.\n\nKamala Harris plans to spend election night in Washington D.C. and is considering a speech at her alma mater, Howard University, according to NBC News.\n\n- Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWalz: Trump crossed 'red line' with Hitler comments\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz addressed reporters Wednesday morning in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he reacted to former President Donald Trump's chief of staff John Kelly highlighting past comments made by Trump admiring Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"Donald Trump's descension into madness, and John Kelly, who I thank for showing the courage to come forward,\" Walz said. \"Truly telling the world, those closest to Donald Trump know how dangerous he is. The desire of Donald Trump to wish he had generals like Adolf Hitler had...\"\n\nHe added: \"If there was ever a red line, he has stepped across it.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY took issue with the former top White House staffer's comments. \"John Kelly has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" Cheung said.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nTrump's regard for Hitler referenced in 2022 book\n\nThis is not the first time voters have heard about Donald Trump's regard for German generals during the Adolf Hitler regime - or the first example of Trump's tenuous grasp of history.\n\nIn their 2022 book \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,\" authors Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump told then-Chief of Staff John Kelly: \"You (bleeping) generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?”\n\nTaken aback, Kelly told Trump: “You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?”\n\nTrump did not know that, and insisted: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him.\"\n\nBaker and Glasser wrote about Trump: \"In his mind, the generals had been completely subservient to the Nazi dictator - and this was the model he wanted for his own military. Kelly told Trump there were no such generals in America, but the president was determined to test the proposition.\"\n\nTrump's campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung in an emailed statement to USA TODAY fired back at Kelly, saying the former White House chief of staff \"has totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his President well while working as Chief of Staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nJohn Kelly adviser says ‘he’s warning us’ about dangers of Trump\n\nThe Harris campaign Wednesday seized on remarks from John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff who warned that the Republican presidential nominee would rule like a dictator in a second term and made past admiring statements about Adolf Hitler.\n\nRetired Army Reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior adviser to Gen. Kelly, said during a Harris campaign call with reporters that speaking out “was no small step” for Kelly, who he called “a dedicated, measured public servant.”\n\n“But he’s seen Donald Trump up close in a way that very few other Americans have, and he's warning us that a second Trump term would be dangerous,” Carroll said.\n\n“What the public has learned about Donald Trump from John Kelly's accounting is damning,” Carroll said, adding that top officials who worked with the former president have made clear Trump “has no empathy, that he's increasingly unstable and unfit, and that he's more extreme than ever.”\n\n“Trump is seeking the power to do anything he wants, anytime he wants,\" Carroll added.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Kelly said the former president exhibits the tendencies of a fascist, including his threat to possibly use the military against domestic political opponents. Kelly also told the Times that Trump remarked on multiple occasions that “Hitler did some good things.”\n\n“It's no surprise that General Kelly came out like he did. I mean, I wish he had done it earlier, but it's great that he has,” said retired U.S. Army Brigadier Gen.

Then, in the wake of the Democratic National Convention, Harris led Trump by 5 percentage points, 48% to 43%. The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Oct. 14-18, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHere are some key points from the poll:\n\nBy double digits, voters said Harris hadn't done enough to explain the specific policies she would pursue in office, 57% to 37%. Those who want to hear more include nearly one in four, 23%, of her supporters. In contrast, those surveyed split evenly, 49% yes to 48% no, on whether Trump had done enough to explain his policies. Just 15% of his supporters want to hear more about what he would do.\n\nThe margins of error for the small subsamples of Latinos and Black voters are plus or minus 9 points − a potential shift of up to 18 points one way or the other − and other recent polls show Harris in a stronger position, including a lead among Hispanics.\n\nHarris edges Trump, 46% to 44%, as the candidate who would do a better job in bringing about change − a crucial asset given wide dissatisfaction with the country's direction. She is favored by double digits, 48% to 31%, as the candidate better able to heal the nation's political divisions.\n\nOn issues, here's what the poll said:\n\nHarris holds a 20-point advantage on handling abortion, 56% to 36%, and a 15-point advantage on health care, 54% to 39%.\n\nTrump edges Harris, 49% to 46%, as the candidate who would do a better job in providing strong leadership.\n\nTrump is more trusted to handle the economy, the top concern on voters' minds, by 10 points, 53% to 43%.\n\nTrump is seen as doing a better job on immigration by 51% to 44% and on foreign policy by 51% to 45%.\n\nHarris strong in Delaware\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by the University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication, which surveyed 400 registered voters in Delaware on Sept. 11-19, Harris and other Democrats held a strong lead in Delaware.\n\nHarris leads Trump with a 55.6% share of the vote. Trump received 35.6% of the votes in the survey, and 3.3% went for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.\n\nOther presidential race indicators\n\nAllan Lichtman, the historian renowned for accurately predicting 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has shared his prediction for this year's White House race. He forecasts that Harris will win. In a video first reported by The New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nHarris and Trump are neck-and-neck in the 2024 race for the White House. In a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Harris leads Trump by 1.7 percentage points. It's even closer when it comes to polling averages from the battleground states. Trump leads Harris by 1.1 percentage points in Arizona, for example, and Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Wisconsin.\n\nGambling lines are in Trump's favor. As of Oct. 18, Trump's probability of winning topped 61% on Polymarket, a crypto trading platform, for the first time since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

Michigan’s share of that, he said, is at least 100,000.\n\n“A large chunk of that is because we did have a number of folks who stepped out of the workforce during the pandemic,” he said. “They were people who were at retirement age but were still working who said, ‘Enough's enough. I'm going to retire.’ \"\n\nOthers close to retirement age made the same decision. \"And then there were people who decided to go work in other careers. So it exacerbated the challenge that existed even pre-pandemic.”\n\nThat’s a chasm that students graduating from nursing schools can’t fill.\n\n“Nursing schools nationally graduate about 200,000 nurses a year,” Ragland said. “So when you look at the fact that we're only bringing 200,000 new people into the workforce, and we're already 1 million-plus folks short, plus people every day are reaching retirement age and stepping out, we simply don't have the pipeline in the workforce to ever really close in that gap.”\n\nExacerbating the crisis is the fact that about 39% nurses working in Michigan today say they plan to leave their jobs in the next year, according to a new University of Michigan study. Of the newly trained nurses surveyed who are younger than 25, 59% said they planned to leave the profession. \"That really says to me that we have a problem with our workplace,\" Christopher Friese, a professor of nursing, health management and policy at the University of Michigan and director of the Center for Improving Patient and Population Health, told the Free Press for a previous article.\n\nRagland said Henry Ford's recruiting efforts are multipronged.\n\n“We continue to work on strategies here with our local academic partners, our nursing schools, to figure out how do we grow the pipeline locally as well,\" he said. “It’s not a one-strategy model. This is one piece of the overall strategy of how do we strengthen the nursing workforce in southeast Michigan.”\n\nA history of Filipino nurses in America\n\nEarly in the coronavirus pandemic, Henry Ford leaders knew they couldn’t wait for a reprieve in the staffing crisis. It might never come.\n\n“We are facing an extreme challenge with our talent with our pipeline across the board,\" said Wright Lassiter III, then CEO of Henry Ford Health, during a panel discussion at the 2021 Mackinac Policy Conference.\n\nThe health system upped recruiting efforts. It looked to Canada to boost its workforce, and now has 590 Canadian nurses on staff. It brought in travel nurses, too, shelling out premium pay that nationally averages more than double what staff nurses earn, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.\n\nBut that wasn’t enough. Henry Ford had to get more creative to fill hundreds of nursing vacancies.\n\n“We are now doing something we haven't talked about in a long time, and that is importing nurses from other countries,” Lassiter announced on that September day in 2021.\n\nNamely, the Philippines — a country that decades ago supplied nurses when there were shortages in the U.S.\n\n“The Philippines has historically had a pool of talent, of nurses trained very similar to what we have here in the United States,” said Eric Wallis, Henry Ford’s chief nursing officer. “They are obviously very proficient with English, and so the care that they deliver in country and their training, etc., is very comparable to what we experience. It makes their onboarding and their transition a lot easier than other places in the world.”\n\nMore:Michigan has a shortage of primary care doctors: What's causing it\n\nMore:University of Michigan Health, Sparrow combine to form $7B system\n\nAdditionally, the Philippines has a surplus of nurses, he said.\n\n“They're actually producing more nurses than they have need for in country, and so economically, it's almost an export for them,” Wallis said. “A lot of these folks, when they do come to other countries — the United States, U.K., the EU — a lot of their income goes back to support their family members … because it's so much greater than they would make as a nurse in the Philippines.\n\n“The government there has been very supportive of creating and exporting some of their talent in health care, and particularly with nurses.\"\n\n400 Filipino nurses have accepted Henry Ford offers\n\nBut it took nearly two years from when Lassiter made that announcement to bring Tabudlo, the first registered nurse in this wave, from the Philippines to Detroit.\n\n“We have authorization to recruit up to 600 nurses,” Wallis said. “We've got just a little over 400 offers that we've made to Filipino nurses that have been accepted.”\n\nMore:University of Michigan Health, Sparrow combine to form $7B system\n\nMore:3.17 million Michiganders must reapply for Medicaid. Why it matters now.\n\nThose nurses must clear medical licensing and immigration hurdles before they can come to the U.S.\n\n“We expect the total time frame from offer to when they are here could be anywhere from 14 to 20 months,” Ragland said.\n\nThe timing is slowed by U.S. testing requirements, along with a complex visa process managed by the U.S. State Department.\n\nState Department puts visa approvals on hold\n\n“Every year, the U.S. government decides how many visas are going to be issued, and throughout the year they kind of monitor how many visas they've issued,” Wallis said. “This past month, they looked at that math, and determined that they maybe are a little bit oversubscribed for this current federal fiscal year and so they slowed the process down.”\n\nThe issuance of new, employment-based visas to workers from the Philippines is on hold at least until Oct. 1, when the new federal fiscal year starts, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Free Press.\n\n“We cannot predict when wait times will return to previous levels,” the spokesperson said. “The annual limit will reset with the new fiscal year in October, and worldwide demand for EB-3 visas will be evaluated against the annual limit for (fiscal year) 2024 to determine adjustments to the final action dates at that point. … EB-3 is the immigrant visa category most commonly sought by nurses, however health care workers may also be recipients of other categories of immigrant visas, including family-based immigrant visas.”\n\nHenry Ford’s leaders are encouraging lawmakers to pass legislation that would speed up the process for international nurses looking to come to the U.S. to help alleviate the shortage.\n\n“We are having conversations with our government affairs folks and our local elected officials to try to help us in that space,” Wallis said. “Sometimes, even though our government is trying to do the right thing and manage immigration appropriately, there's unintended consequences to that if we don't look at all the nuances to those decisions.\n\n“We’re in the process of advocating and saying we really need this to be reevaluated and think about the challenge that's going on in the health care sector in the United States and how this is making the problem worse, not better.”\n\nOther hospital systems also seek international help\n\nMcLaren Health Care, which has 14 Michigan hospitals, also is looking beyond U.S. borders to recruit nurses and medical technologists.\n\nGrand Blanc-based McLaren posted more than 150 open nursing positions to its website in the month of April alone and is offering signing bonuses of $20,000 for cardiac care registered nurses at its Bay City hospital.\n\nIt already has some Canadian workers and now is seeking nurses and medical technologists from the Philippines, Nigeria, Kenya, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\n\n“We’re proud to say that our first set of offers recently went out with more to follow in the coming weeks,” said Kimberly Keaton Williams, vice president of talent acquisition and development and chief diversity officer for McLaren. “We anticipate welcoming a group of registered nurses and medical technologists to the state for placement at our facilities in the second half of 2024.”\n\nTrinity Health is doing the same.\n\nAbout 100 international workers — including some from the Philippines — already are employed by the Livonia-based health system, said Shana Lewis, vice president of human resources-talent acquisition.\n\nTrinity operates 88 hospitals in 26 states, including eight in Michigan. Of the roughly 100 international workers systemwide, six are working in Michigan, Lewis said.\n\nMore:Maternal mortality jumped 35% during pandemic's 1st 9 months, MSU study shows\n\nMore:U-M to begin prescription drug delivery by drone in 2024\n\n“We expect to hire an additional 200 nurses in Michigan and several hundred more across our national system over the next two years,” Lewis said. “While we are excited about the opportunity to capture a broader workforce, we are being thoughtful in ensuring we have the right infrastructure to support long-term retention and high engagement.\"\n\nCorewell Health, Michigan’s largest health system — born of a 2022 merger between the former Spectrum and Beaumont Health — also told the Free Press it is working to recruit international nurses to address the staffing crisis.\n\nThough Corewell didn’t provide details, spokesperson Beth Cranson said its efforts to bring nurses from abroad, “complements the nurse scholar programs at Grand Valley State University and Oakland University, which are designed to increase the talent pipeline.”\n\nFilipino nurses make 3-year commitment to Henry Ford\n\nTabudlo met some co-workers for the first time Thursday at Henry Ford’s headquarters and took a shuttle bus to its main Detroit hospital.\n\n\"They always say that I'm courageous to be coming here alone, but I'm just excited because it's a new clinical environment and there are so many different specialties here,\" he said. \"I'm a person who wants always wants to learn.\"\n\nTabudlo and the other nurses who come from the Philippines to work for Henry Ford will be paid at the same rate as all other nurses on staff, Wallis said, based on experience. Salaries range from $70,000 to $100,000 a year.\n\n“They do sign an employment agreement of three years with the organization,” Ragland said. “We do as much as we can on the front end to make sure that we're aligning them with the opportunity that sets them up to be successful.\n\n“We do pay for pretty much the majority of their immigration journey. However, there are some that are bringing maybe their family members over or there's an added cost to that. We are advancing them funds to help them do that.\n\n“We don't want there to be any barrier to put them in a position where they want to change their mind. So we do provide advances and once they are on the job and on the payroll, we work out a very amenable payback schedule for them that we think is going to work out nicely for them.”\n\nThe health system contracts with a housing company to provide an apartment for the first month and other necessities.\n\n“We will provide them with the first 30 days of housing ... a one-bedroom or two-bedroom ... furnished apartment,\" Ragland said. \"These apartments will be located within as close proximity to the site hospitals as possible because, again, most of these folks will not have ... their own transportation and many of them will not be aligned with any other family or friends here.\"\n\nThe housing contractor will stock the refrigerator with a grocery starter package, and provide other help, too, Ragland said.\n\nMore:Michigan hospitals get federal grants to be ready for the next pandemic\n\nMore:U-M study: Manufacturing jobs associated with higher risk of ALS\n\n“They'll help them on their very first day here to apply for a Social Security card, and if they do plan to drive, we'll get them started on the driver's license process,” he said. “So it's really everything from A to Z. If the nurse is bringing over a family where kids are going to need to be registered in the schools, they'll assist with that process, and help them find the local churches.”\n\nTabudlo is staying within walking distance of the hospital, but just in his first few days of living in the Motor City, he's come to realize that he needs a Michigan driver's license and a car.\n\n\"We often use public transportation in the Philippines, but here, I think a car is a necessity,\" he said. \"The establishments and the facilities are too far from each other here.\"\n\nMentors ease the transition\n\nThe new nurses will have mentors, too.\n\nSome of the nurses from the Philippines who came to work for Henry Ford during earlier staffing shortages in the 1980s to the early 2000s are still employed by the health system, Wallis said, and are helping the newcomers get adjusted.\n\n“They're extremely loyal to the organization, they’re hardworking, and they're great nurses,” Wallis said.\n\nAmong them is Wilson Rapanut, 52, of Sterling Heights, who moved to Lubbock, Texas, in 2003 for a hospital nursing job from the same part of the Philippines as Tabudlo. He worked in Texas for eight years before moving to Detroit for an operating room nursing position at Henry Ford.\n\nRapanut remembers the challenges of moving to a foreign country to start a new life.\n\n“When I came first in the United States, I was very excited and terrified as well because I don't know anybody,” Rapanut said. “I wanted to move into the U.S. to pursue my dream.\n\n“We were lucky because the first nurses who came before us, they helped us. We needed groceries so they could drive us to the grocery store, things like that. And then the hospital partnered with a credit union and a car dealership so we could get a car.”\n\nRapanut said he is confident Tabudlo will be successful in the operating room at the Detroit hospital; his first shift is May 2.\n\n“With all his experience, I think the transition will be not that hard for him,\" Rapanut said. \"He has OR experience already. ... The only thing is that the technology is more advanced here. So that's the only struggle he is going to have is the technology. Back home we don't have the robots. … Here, we have robotics.\n\n“I'm just to advise him, make him more comfortable in there. I think seeing me, as another Filipino, too … it will be more comfortable for him.”\n\nLeaders expect international recruiting needs to ease\n\nThough an influx of 600 new nurses from the Philippines will definitely help the staffing shortage at Henry Ford, Wallis said it can't be the only strategy the health system uses to fill all the vacancies it has now or in the future.\n\n\"Part of what we're talking about now is what is our ongoing strategy,\" he said. \"I don't think the nursing workforce is going to be completely fixed in the next couple of years. It's going to take longer-term work across the country to do that.\"\n\nBut he can envision a time when the need for international recruiting won't be as urgent.\n\n\"We want to get to a place where maybe we're looking at 25 to 50 international nurses a year coming not only from the Philippines, but looking at other places around the globe where the immigration process is reasonable, the training is appropriate and the English proficiency is there,\" Wallis said. \"How do we look at international recruiting as a whole as a part of our talent strategy?\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

He extolls the importance of resilience. Champions, he says in a clipped English accent that denotes \"posh gent,\" keep pushing forward.\n\nBut the headwinds are blustery and accelerating.\n\nOn July 4, America’s Independence Day, Britain is all but certain to vote out the ruling center-right Conservative Party after 14 tumultuous years. Voting stations in 650 constituencies across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are open until 10 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), when an exit poll will be published. Conservative lawmakers like the steely Sir Iain Duncan Smith, are − for the first time in a long time − on the sharp end of an election.\n\nBritain’s Tories, as the Conservatives are known, have dominated for decades, winning 8 of the last 11 votes. Those days may be over as voters flock to the opposition Labour Party and its methodical if slightly flavorless leader Keir Starmer.\n\n'Sir' Keir Starmer:Meet UK's next likely prime minister\n\nAmid moribund economic growth and decaying infrastructure, support for the Conservatives has hit record lows, with the party on track for its worst-ever election result. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s ratings are at an all-time low, while many are struggling with steep rises in the cost of living that have pushed Britain’s poverty rate to 18%.\n\nThree years after Brexit − when Britain left the European Union − immigration, a key factor in that polarizing decision, has never been higher.\n\nThe Conservatives, one expert says, are headed for “extinction.”\n\nAdvice from Samuel L. Jackson\n\nStill, as the going gets tough, Smith who attended Britain's revered Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, made a surprising choice to rally a platoon of campaign volunteers on a recent day.\n\nSurveying his troops, the 70-year-old turned not to party mainstays Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher for inspiration. Instead, this lawmaker of three decades reached across the pond to U.S. popular culture – and the gritty 2005 Samuel L. Jackson basketball drama “Coach Carter.”\n\n\"In the middle of the game, when they're really going to pieces, and they're really just not playing properly, Coach Carter calls a time out, brings his team in, and he says something very simple to them. He says: 'We play our game. We don't play their game.'”\n\nSmith spoke outside the main train station in Chingford and Woodford Green, a mixed-income district 12 miles from central London.\n\nHe handed out fliers to the volunteers encapsulating what he said was his game: getting a local hospital rebuilt; raising funds to fix a bridge; increased police patrols; and supporting a library he claimed the area's Labour-run local government was trying to close. (The local council blamed the library's dire straits on years of Conservative cuts.)\n\n\"I'm focusing on one thing only, and that's this constituency and who can do the best for it,\" Smith said, marching off to persuade residents. He wore a pair of Nike sneakers, and the collar of his polo shirt was firmly turned up in a manner associated the British upper classes, expensive private schools and rugby players.\n\nCoach Carter's rousing words rang in his ears.\n\nBoris Johnson's COVID parties and a financial meltdown\n\nThe problem for Smith and other Conservatives is that, for many in Britain, the political mood music of the last 14 years has been far from stirring.\n\nIt's a period that encompasses a messy, divisive Brexit vote most Britons now view as a mistake. The COVID-19 pandemic saw the U.K. experience higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death than other advanced economies − despite spending longer in strict lockdowns.\n\nTousle-haired and gaffe-prone Boris Johnson was prime minister for just three years. But each one was stormy.\n\nJohnson faced waves of resignations from his cabinet. He was investigated by police for the so-called Partygate scandal, when Johnson ignored his own lockdown to tipple with staff and friends. He devised, and Sunak implemented, what experts say was a madcap and ineffective plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.\n\n'Stop the boats':Britain wants to send asylum seekers 4,000 miles away to Rwanda\n\nLiz Truss, Johnson's successor, resigned just 44 days after unveiling an economic plan that spooked financial markets, spiked mortgage payments and tanked the British pound.\n\nTruss's precarious position sparked an avalanche of memes asking if her government could outlast a head of iceberg lettuce. Chaos gripped the nation. A wilting vegetable won. Truss’s tenure was the shortest in British history.\n\n'People feel that nothing works'\n\nFor much of the past decade, Britain has, meanwhile, been beset by perpetual labor strikes, from train drivers, doctors, teachers and just about any other profession with direct or indirect connections to the underfunded and overburdened welfare state.\n\nEven Queen Elizabeth II, to use a British phrase, decided to \"pop her clogs\" under a Conservative government. Britain's beloved monarch, who reigned for 70 years and 214 days and met 13 out of the last 14 U.S. presidents, died at 96 just two days after swearing in Truss.\n\nTim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said part of the problem for the Conservatives is they've been in power \"too long for people to forgive\" the lack of improvements to their lives. After so long, \"it's difficult to accept excuses,\" he said.\n\nFor real:An AI candidate is on the ballot for U.K. election\n\n\"People feel that nothing works. Everything from potholes in the streets to getting a doctor's appointment. It just seems to be really, really difficult these days,\" said Bale. \"I think that's due to the chickens of austerity coming home to roost.\"\n\n\"If you prioritize, as the Conservatives did before COVID, low spending and low taxation, it's going to impact basic services like health and education and bring local councils to the brink of collapse.\"\n\nRead his lips: No new taxes\n\nYet it's not clear Labour has the answers.\n\nStarmer, 61, a former prosecutor and human rights lawyer known for his thoughtful manner and grasp of policy detail, has pledged to kickstart growth by reforming the economy and focusing on five “national missions\" that will, he says, \"end the chaos.\"\n\nThis involves, Starmer says, abiding by tough spending rules. It also means nationalizing train lines and at least one energy firm, cracking down on wealthy tax evaders, hiring more teachers and police officers, and reforming the country’s border security.\n\nStarmer has vowed to cut waiting lists at public hospitals, boost subsidies for daycare and help Britain's relatively unproductive workforce re-skill for emerging industries. (Labour also pledged to fix a million potholes a year.)\n\nBut there's a catch: Starmer says he'll do it without raising taxes. At least not right away.\n\n\"Labour is offering the country a very simple message: It's the change party,\" said Matt Beech, who directs the Center for British Politics at the University of Hull. \"In reality, I'm not sure how much fiscal room there's going to be.”\n\n\"If and when Labour becomes government it's going to need to find some cash from somewhere pretty quickly,\" said Bale. \"The problem is, it's ruled out a lot of obvious sources of that cash,” including tax hikes.\n\nOliver Duff, editor of the “i” newspaper, wrote recently that \"both parties have colluded” in what watchdogs call a \"conspiracy of silence,\" refusing to face “tough tax and spending choices.”\n\nGaza war haunts the UK election\n\nStarmer has tried to remodel Labour after a crushing election defeat in 2019 under Jeremy Corbyn, whose left-wing policies on everything from nuclear weapons to the royal family alienated many voters.\n\nCorbyn, who often attends pro-Palestinian rallies, was suspended from the party over allegations connected to anti-semitism.\n\nStill, Labour’s campaign has not been entirely smooth sailing.\n\nOne distraction grabbed headlines in Smith's constituency, after Starmer dropped the Labour candidacy of economist Faiza Shaheen after she \"liked\" social media posts that allegedly downplayed anti-semitism allegations linked to Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\nSome Labour voters more broadly have been upset over what they see as Starmer's implicit support for Israel and his failure to quickly call for a ceasefire. (He did eventually.) The party has seen rebellions and resignations over the war.\n\nFor Conservatives, the issue is even more toxic in a country where, as that war has dragged on, surveys show Britons are far more likely to sympathize with Palestinians than Israelis.\n\nStarmer is 'beyond landslide territory'\n\nThe outcome of Britain’s vote is not expected to substantially change its close relationship with the U.S., though Labour would be more comfortable with President Joe Biden than the unpredictable Donald Trump.\n\nLabour chose not to make someone available to speak with USA TODAY at its local offices in Chingford and Woodford Green. Shaheen, dropped by Labour, is now running as an independent. Smith won the district in 2019 by fewer than 1,300 votes. Polls show he has his work cut out for him.\n\nAt least he stands a chance.\n\nYouGov, an online survey firm, forecasts Labour may win 425 out 650 seats in Parliament, a result it described as \"beyond landslide territory\" and that Matt Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, called an \"extinction level event\" for the Conservatives.\n\nIf the polls are accurate, Labour could win Britain’s biggest majority since 1924. The Conservatives could be reduced to just 108 seats, their worst performance since 1906.\n\nImmigration: Robbing Peter to pay Paul\n\nWhile out knocking on doors in Chingford and Woodford Green, Smith conceded the public was dissatisfied.\n\nBut he ascribed much of the nation's predicament to external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine. Both, he said, fueled a sharp rise in food, energy and transportation costs.\n\n\"No government since World War Two faced what we faced,\" Smith said.\n\nIn a recent briefing with reporters, Foreign Secretary David Cameron said something similar. \"COVID hit the economy like an iceberg hitting a ship,\" said Cameron, a former Conservative prime minister.\n\nFew economists would dispute this.\n\nBritain was particularly susceptible to energy price shocks caused by fluctuating gas supplies from Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion. The pandemic and the Ukraine war disrupted trade and aggravated inflation.\n\nStill, Beech, of the University of Hull, said those factors are only part of a \"necessary but not sufficient\" explanation for the Tory decline.\n\n\"To be a sufficient analysis you also have to look at several big policy failures that have underlined the fact that the Conservatives lost their reputation for governing competence,\" he said. \"The first one, perhaps the most important one, is that Boris Johnson took Britain out of the EU on a pledge to reduce low-skill and no-skill immigration from the EU.\n\n\"He did that. Then non-EU immigration skyrocketed. He robbed Peter to pay Paul.\"\n\n'The Conservative brand is broken'\n\nAn analysis by the independent National Centre for Social Research, found that trust in the country's politicians has rarely been lower.\n\nAlmost six in ten said they would \"almost never\" trust a politician to tell the truth in what the survey characterized as a \"tight corner' – when facing some kind of pressure.\n\nThe last time trust was so low in Britain was in the wake of a 2009 Parliamentary expenses scandal. One lawmaker was found to have spent almost $40,000 in public money on renovations to his backyard, including $2,000 on an “ornamental duck island.”\n\nThis may partly explain the appeal of Brexit provocateur Nigel Farage, perhaps the most famous politician in Britain who has never been elected to the House of Commons (though he did serve in the EU’s Parliament).\n\nAfter several years in the political wilderness when he pursued a TV career on a FOX News-like channel and spent time in the U.S. campaigning for his friend Donald Trump, Farage announced in early June he was re-taking the reins of the right-wing Reform UK party.\n\nPolls show Reform UK snapping at the heels of the Conservatives. YouGov’s latest polling, from June, put support for Conservatives at a galling 18% while Farage’s Reform garnered 17%. Support for Reform has stayed strong despite claims of racism and poor personal conduct among some party activists and candidates.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Farage said he was joining the race \"to, well, to use a D-Day analogy, establish a beachhead and build for 2029,\" when the next general election takes place.\n\n\"The Conservative brand is broken. It might have been around for 200 years but I think it's done,\" said Farage.\n\nOn the doorstep in Chingford and Woodford Green, a hospital worker told Smith he was grateful to him for getting a tree removed that was blocking his driveway.\n\nAnother said he'd always voted Conservative and probably always would. \"Isn't that a good enough reason?\"\n\nA third, a teacher and probable Labour voter, said, \"I don't want that guy to win,\" motioning toward Smith, who was around the corner, out of view.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/02/26/tiktok-sober-gen-z-travel-trends/72684017007/", "title": "'I want to get there before it gets too touristy': How Gen Z is ...", "text": "Seven years ago, Eli Snyder’s job didn’t exist, nor would the 25-year-old feel confident about choosing a travel destination.\n\nAs a full-time TikTok travel influencer, Snyder is in Laos before spending the next couple of months exploring Vietnam and the Philippines. The Kansas City native then plans to leave Asia and venture into six South American countries, including Argentina and Chile.\n\nTo Snyder, travel is all about being “surprised,” and having his “preconceived notions about a place to be turned upside down.” Of course, connecting with the local culture and eating good food is a big part of it too.\n\n“(Before, if you were) going to Mexico, you’re going to do an all-inclusive, but now you’re going to leave the coast and go inland to see the rural towns,” he said.\n\nSnyder is inspired by fellow young content creators who travel to less touristy destinations – places his parents would never dream of going to. “There’s an emphasis on finding your own destination and spots rather than tourist hotspots,” Snyder said.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nYounger people have always been scrappy as they seek to travel the world and discover themselves. After all, youth hostels have been around for over a century. “I think some things don’t change through generations: the fundamental appeal of travel is timeless, offering interesting perspectives of the world and hitting that recharge button,” said Will Jones, brand manager at StudentUniverse, a travel platform exclusively for students and youth.\n\nSince most Gen Z members are just starting their careers, they have less disposable income to spend on travel and are usually seeking out the best deals.\n\n“A lot of people in their mid-20s are interested in saving money when they travel, getting the most bang for their buck,” Naomi Schiller, 25, an administrative assistant at the Metropolitan Opera props department, told USA TODAY “I don’t have the money to throw around on awesome accommodations.”\n\nHowever, Gen Z is finding new ways to travel. Gone are the days of partying until sunrise. “They’re leaning much more into the cultural side of things and away from the party type,” said Jones. The young generation has an increased desire to go off the beaten path and immerse themselves in the culture they’re visiting – and they can do that with the ubiquity of technology and social media.\n\nHere are four Gen Z travel trends:\n\n1. #TravelTikTok\n\nMove over travel guidebooks and TripAdvisor, TikTok is the new place for young people seeking travel inspiration.\n\n“A lot of inspiration comes from social media, like TikTok or Instagram reels,” Greta Redleaf, 20, a student at American University, told USA TODAY. Redleaf is in a study abroad program and said social media has been especially helpful as she explores new destinations on the weekends.\n\n“I’m in Scotland right now, so I follow a lot of European travel accounts, and they sometimes post deals,” she said.\n\nIn the 2024 State of Student & Youth Travel Report by StudentUniverse, 89% of the 4,000 surveyed 18- to 25-year-olds – who are in full-time education and either live in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia – said they’ve found new destinations through TikTok, and 70% use TikTok as a trip-planning tool. Over The largest demographic of TikTok users is between the ages of 18 and 24, as of January.\n\nHailing from Sydney, Issy McDermott, 23, also sources her travel ideas mainly from social media. “When I was younger, I used to watch travel videos on YouTube,” she said. Now she uses TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThe vast majority of these Gen Z travelers seek to discover destinations untouched by mass tourism or not easily found. “Right now, I really want to visit Sri Lanka for a mix of the beaches and the more adventurous side,” McDermott said. “It’s kind of building up a hype on social media, so I want to get there before it gets too touristy.”\n\nSnyder said the access and connectivity that social media offers mean “people are willing to go to places older generations would have considered too dangerous.”\n\n2. Sobering up\n\n“Unlike younger generations in the past, Gen Z is steering away from the typical young travel of partying,” Jones said. “They would rather experience a new culture and go sightseeing.” The most popular destinations among Gen Zers were found to be Italy and Japan, which are “more cultural places than the more traditional party places.”\n\nAccording to the report, 83% of young travelers would consider taking a vacation without any alcohol to avoid unsafe situations. They also “would rather spend money on other things.”\n\n“I have described myself in the past as a terrible tourist. I don’t usually travel with a strict, ‘I want to see this, this and this,’ ” Arthur Tisseront, 26, a video game dialogue writer living in Finland, told USA TODAY. “I usually try to find somewhere to stay that is reasonably priced but in a part of the city or town or area I’m in that will let me experience whatever older culture exists there.”\n\nAs more research reveals the harmful effects of alcohol, Snyder thinks more young people are going to be traveling sober “big time.”\n\nFor Snyder, alcohol is near the bottom of his priorities when it comes to travel. He recently spent a month in the Middle East with a friend and didn’t have a sip of alcohol, nor did he miss it. “Not once did that come across our mind,” he said. Alcohol is legal in some Middle Eastern countries, like Jordan, but not widely accepted. In others, like Yemen, alcohol is prohibited. “Although there wasn’t alcohol to be had, it wasn’t a deterrent.”\n\n3. Embarking on their own\n\nMore younger women are also looking to venture out on their own. Over half of the surveyed women said they are interested in solo travel, with 83% of them inspired by female content creators who travel solo. Those who want to jet-set alone say it’s to get out of their comfort, for self-discovery and enjoy a sense of freedom.\n\nAn international business student in Syndey, McDermott has been traveling by herself for her summer break for the past two months. She’s spent the last three weeks in India, but she’s currently enjoying the “nice vibes”' in Goa.\n\n“I’ve noticed a lot more people solo travel, and my mom and dad never did anything like that,” she said. “I’m a bit more adventurous when I travel. I like to see the culture and have unique experiences rather than see tourist attractions and prioritize comfort.”\n\nShe often connects with fellow young travelers at the hostel and joins them on excursions or doesn’t venture out alone at night, so she rarely feels unsafe, she said.\n\nNot all Gen Zers agree on this, though. Some told USA TODAY they prefer using trips as a way to visit friends and family who live far away.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, \"I wanted to be out traveling for work and pleasure, and I ended up stuck at home. I had a roommate move out, so I was by myself, and I want to get out there,” Brendan McPhillips, 24, a construction supply salesperson based in Denver, told USA TODAY. “(Solo travel) can be fun, but I found it kind of isolating, so I kind of looked at where I have friends and saying ‘hey, I want to come visit.’ ”\n\n4. Train takeover\n\nGen Z travelers are also more interested in alternative modes of transportation, especially trains when they’re available.\n\n“If there’s a train, I’m taking a train, it doesn’t matter if the train is 30 hours,” Snyder said. While the sustainability aspect appeals to him, the main reason is the “intimate connection with the countryside that you miss on a plane and bus because it’s so chaotic.”\n\n“Ideally, for environmental reasons, I would prefer to take the train if I can, but unfortunately, a lot of times the train can be twice as expensive and twice as long as flying,” Emma Quinn, 26, a librarian in New York told USA TODAY. “My roommate and I are going from Chicago to California by train. That’s two days in a sleeper car, and that’s something I’ll pay a premium for because the experience is really good.”\n\nEven so, the appeal of the deal can outweigh other concerns.\n\n“I would love to travel more places locally on Amtrak or rail systems like that, but because of the price point and because of schedules or when they come and go, it usually winds up being by car,” Schiller, the Metropolitan Opera employee said.\n\nMcPhillips said that he relies on Frontier Airlines’ all-you-can-fly GoWild pass for a lot of his personal travel, which lets him get very cheap last-minute flights.\n\n“People complain about Frontier and Spirit, but I’m kind of just expecting to get from point A to point B. That’s all I really want,” he said. “I want the cheapest ticket. I see people complaining about everything, and I’m like, ‘yeah, but you’re getting the lowest price.’”\n\nGen Z travelers also often want to find easy ways to get around once they’re in their destination.\n\n“Renting a car sucks,” Tisseront, the video game dialogue writer, said. “If I can go to a place that will let me travel by bus, by tram, by metro, by train, by walking, however, some way that isn’t a car, that makes trips more justifiable to me.”\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

Why the overseas vote could be vital", "text": "LONDON – In mid-October, Greg Swenson, an American who has lived in London for the last decade, was doing what he described as \"the banking circuit\": Milan, Paris, Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"It's been crazy. Six cities in two weeks,\" Swenson said in a phone interview from an airport. He was on his way to Dublin. He had recently returned from the Middle East. The week after, Swenson, an investment banker who chairs the U.K. chapter of Republicans Overseas, an organization that is recognized by but not formally affiliated with the Republican National Committee, was on the road yet again.\n\n\"We've never been aggressive about getting out the vote,\" Swenson said of his organization.\n\n\"I don't really feel like jumping out of bed every day trying to register as many people as I can who are probably going to vote Democrat anyway. You want to focus your get out the vote on areas that are going to vote Republican.\"\n\nAmericans overseas: Where are they? Who are they?\n\nThis year, though, may be different, with a stronger effort to drum up votes from Americans living abroad.\n\nOverseas voters have rarely commanded the full attention of presidential campaigns. But with the U.S. presidential election nail-bitingly close, campaigns for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been looking for votes under every rock they can find. This year, that means overseas, too.\n\nThere is not a precise count of how many Americans live overseas. Estimates from the U.S. Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), Association of Americans Resident Overseas and outside experts put it as low as 4.4 million and as high as 9 million. According to the FVAP's 2020 report to Congress, only 7.8% of them voted in the 2020 presidential election, compared with an overall turnout rate of 67%.\n\nA relatively low turnout rate by overseas voters may help explain why some in that voting bloc have felt sidelined in terms of attention from campaigns in past elections. Other reasons include their geographical distance, poor data on where these Americans are, who they are politically, and difficulties in figuring out how to vote. For Republicans like Swenson, there is a sense that looking for votes overseas is not very useful, since the overseas voting bloc is thought of as favoring Democrats. That is a shift that took place about a decade ago when civilians voting from abroad started outnumbering traditionally Republican-supporting military voters, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nThere may be evidence that in this election cycle, both campaigns have been more actively courting potential American voters who live in far-flung places from Australia to Guatemala.\n\nFor Swenson, in addition to flying around Europe and the Middle East to speak to prospective Republican voters, his organization has increased its social media presence by purchasing Facebook ads for the first time. It has hosted more in-person events than it has in prior election years, including outside NFL games in London.\n\nIn June, Trump's son, Donald Jr., was among the guests at a glitzy Republican fundraiser in London hosted by an Australian actress and her wealthy British property developer husband. The price of a ticket ranged from $10,000-$100,000. Swenson said the event raised at least $2.5 million. While that may not sound like a lot compared to the millions that get raised in the U.S. at similar events, it represented a milestone for Republicans Overseas.\n\n\"That changed the relationship,\" Swenson, 62, said of the London fundraiser. \"Prior to that, my group had no contact with the campaign. We had all been doing this just because we're civic-minded.\"\n\nWhen Karen M., 54, a likely Democratic voter from Florida and longtime London resident, recently passed by a house in London’s South Kensington neighborhood that was bedecked in Harris signs in every window, she was \"very surprised.\"\n\nKaren, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, thought: Who were these signs in central London meant for when English people aren't even the ones voting in November?\n\nAttention on voters abroad:Pennsylvania Republicans lose effort to set aside overseas ballots for screening\n\nBattleground states, 'gorilla PR'\n\nThe Democratic National Committee estimates that 1.6 million overseas voters are eligible to cast ballots in one of seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThese are the states that will almost certainly determine the outcome of the presidential race on Nov. 5. Given that in the 2020 presidential election, President Joe Biden won Nevada by fewer than 11,000 votes and carried Georgia by fewer than 12,000, Democrats have also appeared to spy an extra opportunity with voters overseas.\n\nSharon Manitta, a retired conservator of historic textiles from Auburn, New York, who lives in Wiltshire, England, and is the global press secretary for Democrats Abroad, the official overseas arm of the Democratic National Committee, said that the DNC gave $300,000 for voter outreach and education around the world. That appears to be its record amount for an election cycle. A group of former ambassadors raised at least another $100,000, she said, all of which has gone toward phone banking and voter registration efforts.\n\n\"We are doing anything we can think of to make sure Americans are registered and vote,\" Manitta said. \"Sometimes this involves what I have christened 'gorilla PR.' If I'm in a grocery store and I hear a North American accent I'll drop a little votefromabroad.org business card in their shopping trolley.\"\n\nIn the U.K., Democrats Abroad has also shown up at farmers' markets. It opened a pop-up campaign office decorated with U.S. flags at the London School of Economics in central London. There, volunteers hit the phones to call as many Americans living overseas as they can. In mid-October, former U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and her daughter Christine, a Democratic Party political strategist, even stopped by.\n\nManitta, who is 76, said this year marks her 16th presidential cycle and she can't recall another example of a Democratic Party \"celebrity\" of Pelosi's stature making an appearance at a Democrats Abroad office.\n\nIn June, Anna Wintour, the British-American editor of Vogue magazine held a rival fundraising event in London for Democrats around the same time as the Republican Overseas one, though few details were made public.\n\n\"It's been growing over the years,\" said Manitta, referring to what she sees as the increased attention paid to overseas voters by presidential campaigns.\n\nWhat to know if you're an overseas voter:\n\n◾ Abroad and don't have a voting plan? Go to your state's electoral website or reach out to your political party's local office overseas to know your options and reach out for last-minute advice.\n\n◾ Tip: Get a tracking code for your absentee ballot to ensure your vote arrives in time (every state's timeline is different, but many give a grace period to military and overseas absentee ballots post-Election Day).\n\n◾ Worried about your vote being counted? Once it's arrived, check your vote's status on your state or area's elections website to know your ballot was accounted for.\n\nAbsentee but not absent\n\nAmericans have been casting absentee ballots since the Civil War so that the men who were away fighting could vote. The process became more formalized after World War II because a lot of American soldiers began spending long periods away from home on overseas U.S. military bases. This helps explain why FVAP, which provides the infrastructure for overseas voters, is still administered by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nToday, Americans move overseas for various reasons: family, employment, and quality of life. Relatively little is known about the U.S. population overseas who are eligible to vote, though surveys show they tend to be college-educated, and just under half hold citizenship of the U.S. and another country.\n\nAccording to FVAP estimates, the largest blocs of American overseas voters live in Canada and Mexico, followed by Britain, France and Israel.\n\nStill, for some Americans who live overseas, time zone differences make it difficult to keep up with the election. That's been the case for Regan Moran, 26, who is about to graduate with a nursing degree.\n\nMoran is a Franklin County, Ohio, voter living in Sydney, 16 hours ahead of her home time zone. Catching debates and speeches wasn't possible this election, so Moran has relied on her social media feeds for clips and updates to make her decision.\n\n\"I feel like I've been getting a lot of filtered news without getting to see the actual experience with my own eyes,\" she said. As a resident abroad since February 2023, this is her first time voting overseas.\n\nSurveys show that one of the reasons Americans who live overseas don't vote as much as people in the U.S. do is because they find the paperwork too complicated. Different states have different rules, but ballots must typically be returned to the state where a voter last lived. Federal law requires local election officials to mail absentee ballots 45 days before an election. These mailed ballots can face delays because of administrative hurdles and irregular or poor mail service. Not all states allow overseas voters to cast a ballot by email.\n\nMoran opted for an email ballot she could print out, fill in and mail it to her election officials because it felt trustworthy and safe, she said, calling the process \"easy.\"\n\nTargeted by the Trump campaign with legal challenges\n\nThis year, the Trump campaign has targeted overseas voting in legal challenges, seeking to disqualify ballots of certain voters from abroad, such as some Americans who were born overseas to U.S. parents and the spouses of military voters. It has also made general claims, without providing evidence or specific examples, of fraud and wrongdoing. The Trump campaign has accused Britain's ruling Labour Party of \"blatant election interference.\"\n\nAine Dougherty, 27, a Pennsylvania voter living in Mulhouse, France, said she can tell both campaigns know the importance of overseas voters this election cycle based on the flood of ads targeting voters abroad on her social media in recent months.\n\n\"I'm happy with the fact that there's options for me to make my voice heard from a different country,\" she said. Dougherty, a pastry student, compares her French city's working-class heritage to her home state of Pennsylvania. Her hometown of Bala Cynwyd is located in Montgomery County, a key swing state territory both Harris and Trump have courted in recent weeks.\n\nReproductive rights motivating overseas voters\n\nThe issue of reproductive rights is motivating some Americans overseas to vote in this year's election. As a health care worker who is living with an autoimmune disorder, Moran, the Ohioan living in Sydney, is motivated by the demise of Roe v. Wade. She wants to pursue a career in emergency medicine and grapples with the potential of practicing nursing in any state that wouldn't protect her own and other women's bodies.\n\n\"I don't think I would have an easy time,\" she said of moving back to a place that does not protect women's health. The daily life of an ER nurse would be constantly confronted with this reality, she said: \"I know I would risk my license. I would risk a lot emotionally. I would risk my own health.\"\n\nWhile Harris has campaigned on a promise to restore the protections guaranteed by Roe, JD Vance, Trump's pick for vice president, argued in the vice presidential debate in early October that he and Trump are promoting pro-family policies, such as fertility treatments. He also defended Trump’s position that abortion regulation should be left up to the states.\n\n\"The outcome of this election will seriously change my views on what states I feel I would feel comfortable moving back to,\" Moran said.\n\nDougherty, from Pennsylvania, voted overseas in the 2020 election but said she feels more invested in 2024 because she wants to protect women's rights in her home state and across the country.\n\n\"The people I love are still in America, maybe I'll go back someday,\" Dougherty said. \"I think it's important the country goes in the direction I would want, and I'm doing what I can to make that happen.\"\n\nIs an end to double taxes possible?\n\nAmericans residing outside the U.S. must file tax returns with the IRS, which in some cases can result in them paying taxes in both the U.S. and their country of residence, depending on whether there’s a double tax agreement or not, and how much they earn.\n\nAs part of his pitch to Americans overseas, Trump has vowed to end \"double taxation.\" However, there is a threshold of $120,000, meaning that while everyone must file U.S. taxes regardless of what they earn, only those who earn more than this amount may have to pay additional tax on their income above that level.\n\nThis is nevertheless a policy proposal that has resonated with U.S. overseas voters and political organizers like Joe Beydoun, who chairs Republicans Overseas in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"We're Americans, but we're paying more taxes than anybody else,\" Beydoun, who is based in Dubai, said. \"We're not even competitive in our field.\"\n\nIn 2024, the top personal income tax rate was in Denmark, at 55.9%, according to the Tax Foundation, a Europe-based organization that researches tax policies. The combined U.S. federal and state average rate was 42.1%. There is no personal income tax in the UAE.\n\nBeydoun, who is a former deputy mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, one of America's largest Arab American populations, said he believes Trump will bring \"peace\" amid the Biden administration's support of Israel's ongoing offensive to root out Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nHe said he knows through conversations with friends and family overseas and back home that many people from Michigan with ties to the Middle East feel the same, and could make a big difference come Election Day: \"You need to continue to count the Arab American vote as serious voters.\"\n\nBeydoun added that while past U.S. election cycles in his region were largely defined by high Democratic organizing, he's noticed more energy and engagement from local Republicans asking how to vote from overseas.\n\n\"We used to have to call people and have them register … this time they are calling us,\" he said.\n\n'What we do every election cycle'\n\nStill, even as this year's vote looks very tight, Martha McDevitt-Pugh, the Netherlands-based American chair of Democrats Abroad, said overseas voters have always been important to U.S. elections and that this year is no different.\n\n\"We've been engaged all year, making sure that people know they can vote, how to do it and that their votes can make a difference,\" she said.\n\n\"We're doing that like we do it in every cycle.\"\n\nJohn Fortier, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning Washington think tank, also expressed skepticism over the ultimate impact of the overseas vote.\n\n\"It's just really hard to gauge because it's not one thing, right?\" he said, noting that voters abroad are made up of itinerant students, digital nomads, Americans who can be on short-term business contracts. He said many military personnel overseas \"shift in and out of the U.S.\" and have additional options in terms of where they vote − where they happened to be stationed back in the U.S., where their families may have addresses, or where they last lived.\n\n\"It's really hard to calculate because we don't know how many people are eligible.\"\n\nInsurgent candidate tells Guatemalans:Stay, don’t go to the U.S. This time, they’re listening.\n\nJohn Chudy, an American who worked in international development before retiring in Guatemala, where he now is the chair for the local chapter of Democrats Abroad, said about 40,000 Americans are living in his country. Americans in Guatemala are attuned to the fact that their country often features in the U.S. political debates in the context of immigration. Chudy said that in Guatemala, there are about 600 registered Democrats who he expects to vote. He's not sure about the rest.\n\n\"I know some Republicans here,\" Chudy, 77, said. \"But generally speaking Republicans don't come to Guatemala to retire, though the climate is terrific and it's a lot easier to live on Social Security. So they're pretty much on their own.\"\n\nOn Election Day, Beydoun plans to gather in Dubai at 6 a.m. with Democrats, Republicans and other Americans to watch the results. They'll eat breakfast as the count comes in during what is still nighttime in America. They'll guess who they think the winner will be: \"I'm not sure if we will be surprised or not.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/04/election-2024-live-updates-trump-harris/76033477007/", "title": "Election recap: Trump repeats fraud claims; Harris says swing states ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Monday, Nov. 4. For the latest news and results from the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live updates of Election Day.\n\nAmericans across the country will make their voices heard on Tuesday, choosing between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Republican and Democratic nominees have spent months facing off and laying out their campaign promises on issues ranging from health care to immigration and the economy.\n\nOn the final full day of campaigning, Trump held rallies in pivotal swing states, starting in North Carolina before heading to Pennsylvania for two campaign stops and wrapping up the day in Michigan.\n\nHarris concluded her campaign in Pennsylvania after holding rallies in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, followed by a concert in Allentown.\n\nKeep up with live coverage from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nPresidential election polls 2024:Latest surveys on Harris vs. Trump before Election Day\n\nOprah, Lady Gaga join Harris rally in Philadelphia\n\nKamala Harris' rally in Philadelphia got underway late in the evening with Lady Gaga singing \"God Bless America\" in front of 30,000 people.\n\nIt’s not often that Lady Gaga is the opening act instead of the main attraction.\n\nSeated at a piano, she spoke briefly about the importance of the election. Women will be part of the decision-making on Tuesday, she said, adding, “I am holding in my heart all the tough, tenacious women who made me who I am.”\n\nGaga said she voted for Harris, “someone who will be a president for all Americans.”\n\nHarris' husband Doug Emhoff spoke next and told the crowd, \"My wife cares about what you're going through. She understands what's in your way, and she has concrete plans to help us keep moving forward. Now, isn't that what we want for the next four years?\"\n\nOprah Winfrey was next on stage. She invoked the late John F. Kennedy and the late civil rights leader and Georgia Rep. John Lewis and told prospective voters who might be feeling burnt out that the election was too important to sit out.\n\n\"If we don't show up tomorrow, it is entirely possible that we might not have the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again,\" she said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers and Michael Collins\n\nTrump doubles down on election fraud claims at last rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spread 2020 election misinformation, claimed without evidence that Democrats would try to “cheat” in the 2024 election at his last rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\"When you have open borders, transgender everything, high taxes - very high taxes, they're campaigning on the fact that they're going to raise everybody's taxes - and you have men playing in women's sports, you have to cheat…They have to cheat. They have to cheat. And they do it and they do it very well,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also cast doubt on the accuracy of voting machines in his speech. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, states routinely test and certify their voting machines and conduct checks to ensure ballots are properly counted before election results are finalized.\n\nFor months, Trump and his allies have tried to sow uncertainty around the security of the 2024 race, which political science and democracy experts said would only increase the risk of political violence in the aftermath of the election.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump tells Grand Rapids: 'We're going to blow this thing away'\n\nDonald Trump started his remarks in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by reminiscing about the city, the same place he ended both his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\n“I want to say a very special hello to Grand Rapids. It's been a special place,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said he thinks he’s in “very good shape” for Election Day.\n\n“You're going to turn out tomorrow, and we're going to blow this thing away. Because, you know, we're leading. We're leading going in by hundreds of thousands of votes, but just pretend we're tied or losing by a little bit, because we want to put on a display tomorrow of unity and everything,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe final results of the 2024 race won’t be ready on election night. Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'You will decide the outcome,' Harris tells Pennsylvania\n\nHarris told her supporters in Philadelphia on Monday that the swing state's voters would choose the next U.S. president.\n\n\"You will decide the outcome of this election, Pennsylvania,\" she said.\n\nHarris said at the rally, the last one of her campaign: \"America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward.\"\n\nShe pledged to be a president \"for all Americans\" and told the crowd that \"one of the highest forms of patriotism\" is to fight for the ideals and promise of America.\n\n\"I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she sees that same promise in the faces of her rallygoers. \"We are the promise of America,\" she declared from outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump escalates rhetoric against migrants, opponent\n\nDonald Trump suggested at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday that Penn State wrestlers should fight against migrants.\n\n“Those Penn State guys. I wanted them to wrestle the migrants . . . I told (Ultimate Fighting Championship President) Dana (White) here to set up your league of champions, unbelievable, best fighters in the world, and a migrant league. At the end, I want the migrant to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win. That's how nasty some of these guys are,” Trump said.\n\nAt his previous rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested that Kamala Harris should be in the same ring as boxer Mike Tyson.\n\n“‘Put Mike in the ring with Kamala.’ That will be interesting,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump has previously called his political opponents garbage, scum and enemy from within. Trump's latest comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Josh Meyer\n\nJoe Rogan endorses Trump\n\nJoe Rogan, who hosts the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” endorsed Trump in a post on X, formerly Twitter, sharing a video clip of an interview with Elon Musk as part of his announcement.\n\nMusk “makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” Rogan wrote on X. “For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast.”\n\nTrump and Rogan had previously sat down for a nearly three hour interview last month, where the two discussed topics ranging from extraterrestrial aliens to election interference.\n\n“He was great. And he's not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So I just want to thank Joe Rogan. That's fantastic,” Trump said at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday.\n\nHarris did not appear on Rogan’s show. He wrote on X that her campaign had reached out to him and offered a date for an interview, but he ended up declining because he would have had to travel to her. “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” he wrote.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris stops by Puerto Rican restaurant in Pennsylvania\n\nVice President Kamala Harris grabbed dinner at Puerto Rican restaurant Monday night after a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris’ motorcade stopped by Old San Juan Cafe in Reading, where she was greeted by the owner Diana de La Rosa. La Rosa gave the Democratic presidential nominee a tour of the small eatery and helped her place her order, which included cassava and yellow rice.\n\n“I’m very hungry,” Harris said. “I don’t get a chance to eat as often as I like.”\n\nSpotted inside the restaurant during Harris’ visit: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., and Reading Mayor Eddie Moran.\n\nHarris’ campaign has been making a push to reach Puerto Rican voters, especially after a comedian called the U.S. territory a “floating island of garbage” at a Donald Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nTrump: 'God saved me in order to save America'\n\nDonald Trump urged his supporters in Pittsburgh to get out and vote, referencing the July assassination attempt where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Many people say that God saved me in order to save America,” Trump told the crowd, who burst into cheers.\n\n“And with your help, we will fulfill that extraordinary mission,\" Trump said. “Together, we're going to fulfill - we're going to save our country. But many, many people have said that. To every citizen across this land, I am asking for the honor of your vote.”\n\nTrump also said he would restore peace in the world and criticized his opponent’s handling of issues, including immigration.\n\n“We do not have to live this way,” he said.\n\nTrump and Harris are both deadlocked in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state. Both candidates crisscrossed through the state on Monday to court voters before Election Day.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRapper Will.i.am performs new song 'Yes She Can'\n\nRapper Will.i.am warmed up the crowd at an election-eve rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia on Monday by performing a new song, “Yes She Can.”\n\n“What is wrong with America? Why can’t we get along in America?” the lyrics ask.\n\nThe song goes on to suggest that together Americans can break down barriers and urges them to “register and vote for your life.”\n\n“We could be better than we ever been, we about to have a woman president,” the song concludes, repeating the refrain, “Yes she can!”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHarris knocks on doors in last-minute push in Pennsylvania\n\nSearching for any and every possible vote in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris did a little door-knocking herself Monday night.\n\nHarris was joined by two campaign staff members as she briefly stopped by two homes in Reading, Pennsylvania. At one front door, Harris was greeted by a woman who immediately gave her a hug.\n\n“How are you?” Harris said as the woman introduced the vice president to her husband, Henry. “Hi, Henry. Kamala Harris,” the vice president said. “Very nice to meet you.”\n\nThe woman asked Harris how she is doing.\n\n“You know – it’s the day before the election,” Harris said. “I just wanted to come by and ask for your vote.”\n\n“Well, you got my vote already,” the woman said, adding her husband plans to vote Tuesday.\n\nAt another home, a man answered and introduced himself as Cole. “Cole, that’s our son’s name!” Harris said as she shook his hand.\n\nThe Harris campaign has boasted about dwarfing Trump in the ground game. Over the weekend, more than 90,000 Harris volunteers took part in get-out-the-vote activities, the campaign said, including knocking on more than 3 million doors across the seven battleground states.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris: 'Momentum is on our side'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said momentum in her campaign will catapult her to the presidency.“Tomorrow is Election Day and the momentum is on our side,” Harris said during her rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key swing state.Harris said that her campaign tapped into the “ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams” of the American people, adding that it’s time for a new generation of leadership in the United States.“I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States,” Harris said.But she urged those who have not voted to make sure to cast their ballots, saying “we must finish strong.”“Make no mistake, we will win,\" she said.- Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump says Jill Stein may be one of his 'favorite' politicians\n\nDonald Trump again voiced his liking for Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n“I love the Green Party. Jill Stein…I never met her, but she may be one of my favorite politicians,” Trump told his supporters.\n\nHe previously said at a rally in June that he likes Stein “very much.”\n\nMany critics have said that Stein could act as a spoiler for Democrats and help Trump. In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times last month, Stein dismissed those concerns and said that “those conversations never go anywhere.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVance bashes Biden’s garbage comment, calls Harris ‘trash’\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in Atlanta on Monday criticized Kamala Harris over a remark made last week by her boss, President Joe Biden. In a video call last Tuesday, Biden had referred to Trump supporters as “garbage.”\n\nThe Republican vice-presidential candidate used the moment to knock Harris.\n\n“And I want to ask us not to follow Kamala Harris’ terrible example, because I’m sure that everyone single one of us, all of us gathered here, know somebody planning to vote the wrong way tomorrow,” Vance told the crowd. “... Here in our movement, we love every citizen of this country.”\n\nVance soon followed this criticism with a bit of his own trash talk.\n\n“In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris campaign touts ‘multiple paths’ to 270 electoral votes\n\nOn the eve of Election Day, the Harris campaign said Monday that all seven battleground states remain in play for the Democratic nominee, insisting the vice president doesn’t have to rely on the “blue wall” path for victory.\n\n“We truly believe that we have multiple paths to 270 electoral votes,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a call with reporters. “Sometimes when you get to this stage of the race, or even sooner, you often have to close out a pathway, or a state might not be in play. We are not seeing that at all.”\n\nAll seven of the top battlegrounds are margin-of-error races, polling has consistently showed.\n\nThe clearest path to victory for Harris has long been sweeping the three Rust Belt “blue wall” states that Biden carried in 2020: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Doing so would likely give Harris enough electoral votes to win the election even if she were to lose Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut if Harris loses one of the “blue wall” states, she would need to offset the loss with wins among the four Sun Belt states. And Harris would need to win two Sun Belt states if she wins Michigan and Wisconsin, but loses Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes up for grabs.\n\n“We obviously see that the’ blue wall’ has often been the most straightforward path to get to 270, but we equally see favorable results and numbers in all the Sun Belts,” said O’Malley Dillon.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance encourages Georgians to vote 10 times ‘the legal way’\n\nUsing one of his repeated rally lines, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told a crowd of supporters in Atlanta on Monday evening to vote for Trump 10 times – legally.\n\n“Here is the legal way. The legal way to vote ten times is to get your friends to the polls and take yourself to the polls and get nine of your friends and family to go along with you,” Vance said.\n\nVance noted the Peach State’s tight margin of victory four years ago. In 2020, President Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes. So far, the southern swing state has seen record-breaking early voting turnout.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump says Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live\n\nDonald Trump claimed at a rally in Reading, Pa., on Monday that Kamala Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live after she came onto the show just three days before the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“She uses everything I do. She uses…even Saturday Night Live they copied. They copied. Think of that. Saturday, oh she was great on - they copied my routine, I did it a long time ago, they copied the same routine. I think I did it better, actually. I don’t think - I think anybody could’ve done it. I think anybody could’ve done it better,” Trump said.\n\nDuring the show, comedian Maya Rudolph, who portrayed Harris, spoke to the real Harris through an empty vanity mirror. The two wore a similar suit and necklace, and Harris offered campaign advice to Rudolph.\n\nIn 2015 on “The Tonight Show,” Trump and comedian Jimmy Fallon did something similar. Fallon portrayed Trump, who spoke to the real Republican presidential candidate through a vanity mirror. Both also wore matching suits.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGeorgia Supreme Court cancels late-arriving absentee ballots for Cobb County\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court on Monday canceled any late-arriving absentee ballots that a lower-court judge had ordered be provided to 3,000 Cobb County voters who never received them.\n\nThe ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit after the county in a 2024 battleground state announced it would be mailing thousands of absentee ballots late. Superior Judge Robert Flournoy ordered the county to overnight ballots to voters and allow them to be counted as late as Friday.\n\nBut the Republican National Committee appealed the order because it opposes counting votes that arrive after Election Day. The state Supreme Court ruled that all ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day on Tuesday, as required by state law. The high court ordered county officials to hold on to the late-arriving ballots in a sealed container until further notice from the court.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRapper Fat Joe to undecided Puerto Rican, Latino voters: ‘Where is your pride?’\n\nRapper Fat Joe, who is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, called on Monday for undecided Latino voters to remember the actions former President Donald Trump has taken against the community – from calling Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers” in 2016 to slow response to Puerto Rico after back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\n\n“Where's your pride?” said Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, during Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. “If you're still out there talking about ‘you might be voting for somebody or you're not decided.’ Where's your pride as a Latino?”\n\nHarris stopped in Allentown, a city in Pennsylvania that has a large Puerto Rican and Latino population, in an appeal to voters in the key swing state.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris campaign bracing for Trump to again prematurely declare victory\n\nKamala Harris' president campaign on Monday warned that Republican Donald Trump might try to exploit 2024's late-counted votes to prematurely declare he won the election like he did four years ago.\n\n“We all know that it's going to take some time to get election results,” Dana Remus, the Harris campaign’s legal counsel, said in a call Monday with reporters. “We also all know that Trump will likely use this time to allege fraud, spread misinformation and claim premature victory.”\n\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow the pre-canvassing of mail-in ballots until Election Day, meaning the process to count the ballots could drag past Tuesday in these key battleground states.\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, said it expects near-complete results from North Carolina and Georgia on election night but only partial results from Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Pennsylvania. In Nevada, mail ballots are allowed to be counted if they come in by Nov. 9. And in Pennsylvania, provisional ballots aren’t counted until Nov. 8.\n\n“That's obviously not a sign of fraud. It's just the way it works,” O’Malley Dillon said. “We believe this race is going to be incredibly close. So we may not know the results of this election for several days, but we are very focused on staying calm and confident throughout this period as the process goes through.”\n\nIn the 2020 election, Trump falsely declared victory after in-person Election Day returns showed him leading in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. His leads vanished after mail-in ballots that skewed heavily toward Joe Biden were counted, propelling Biden to victory.\n\nIn a May interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a USA TODAY Network partner, Trump raised doubts about the 2024 election outcome. \"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump said then. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance doubles down on anti-Harris message in last rally\n\nVance kicked off his final campaign stop Monday night by intensifying his criticism of Harris.\n\n“It’s the last day of the campaign, and I think today I’m just gonna say whatever the hell I want to,” Vance said in opening statements to a crowd of supporters in Newtown, Penn.\n\n“This is when I tell you what I really think of Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe GOP candidate called his Democratic opponent “a disaster,” adding that she should “go back to San Francisco where you belong.”\n\nVance later said he did have something nice to say about Harris: a backhanded compliment about her media appearances.\n\n“The one thing I’ll say nice about Kamala Harris is that every single time she gives an interview I think we gain about 50,000 votes,” Vance said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nPennsylvania recount requests could prove ‘vexatious’: expert\n\nPennsylvania could be headed for a big recount. Or many little ones that a former judge says could prove “vexatious.”\n\nThe state is a key battleground where polls show a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. State law calls for an automatic recount if the winning margin is less than 0.5%.\n\nThe state with 9.1 million voters has more than 9,000 voting precincts. Under a 1927 law, it only takes three voters in a precinct to pay $50 fee to request a recount from the county Court of Common Pleas – regardless of the margin of victory. Precincts are capped at 1,200 voters each, under state law.\n\nAfter a flurry of precinct recounts since 2020, the law was updated, according to experts at Keep Our Republic, an advocacy group in Pennsylvania. To force a broader county-level recount, the three voters requesting a recount would need to persuade a judge there was fraud or errors with computations on vote totals.\n\n“The bar is higher now if you want a broader recount. But the law itself allows for I think potentially vexatious behavior,” said John Jones, a former federal judge in Pennsylvania and a member of Keep Our Republic's advisory council in the state. “You should watch carefully in the week after the election, because there may be a number of petitions in counties and they would have to be adjudicated by the county court.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nImmigration takes center stage at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally\n\nDonald Trump continued to lean heavily into his anti-immigrant rhetoric at a rally in Reading, Pa., on the eve of Election Day, telling his supporters that Kamala Harris has “eradicated” the southern border.\n\n“They're taking over your towns, your schools, your hospitals,” Trump said, referring to migrants.\n\nHe later added that, “The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer.”\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, illegal border crossings reached record highs, averaging more than 2 million per year from 2021 to 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection. But more recently, illegal crossings – or “encounters” – at the southern border fell to the lowest total in nearly four years only months after Biden announced broad restrictions on asylum.\n\nTrump also claimed that migrant crime has been “as vicious as there's ever been.” But data analyzed between 2012 to 2022 found that undocumented immigrants have a homicide conviction rate 14% below that of native-born Americans. Immigrants have a 62% lower homicide rate and undocumented immigrants have a 41% lower total criminal conviction rate than native-born Americans.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi, Chris Mueller and Terry Collins\n\nTop US cybersecurity official: Election has 'never been more secure'\n\nTop U.S. cybersecurity director Jen Easterly said Monday that the 2024 elections are more secure than ever, and that local, state and federal election officials are on alert and ready to combat any domestic and foreign interference in the democratic process.\n\n“As we head into tomorrow, I can say with great confidence that our election infrastructure has never been more secure and that the election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free and fair elections,” Easterly, the director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nEasterly and top election security aide Cait Conley acknowledged that there have been “small scale” disturbances, including Russian disinformation videos, severe weather, vandalism to some ballot drop boxes and other incidents that have for the most part already been made public.\n\nBut, Easterly said, “At this point, we see no evidence of activity that has the potential to materially impact the outcome of the presidential election.”\n\nCISA officials, in tandem with other officials nationwide, have been conducting hundreds of table-top exercises in recent years to prepare for any eventuality, Easterly said. She said various forms of disruptions are expected to continue on Election Day and beyond.\n\n“It's important to remember that disruptions happen in every election, which is why election officials invest so much into incident response, preparation and contingency plans,” Easterly said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nSpin the numbers: Trump aides express confidence\n\nElection Day is almost here - finally - so it's time for presidential campaigns to spin numbers and predict victory.\n\nThe Trump campaign put out a memo Monday claiming that, in battleground states, the women's vote and the urban vote are down (bad for Democrats) and the rural vote is up (good for Republicans).\n\nWe'll see when states start counting votes on Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats - who say the numbers overall favor Harris - suspect that Trump is preparing to declare victory before all the key states are called, the better to sow confusion when legal challenges commence.\n\nTrump aides said a premature declaration won't be necessary - the former president is going to win it outright.\n\n\"We will declare victory when we are confident that we have the 270 electoral votes that we need,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters gathered for a Monday rally in Raleigh, N.C. \"The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nVideo: RNC official debunks myth about noncitizen voting\n\nImmigrants here illegally aren’t likely to be registered to vote in Pennsylvania because they don’t have drivers licenses or Social Security numbers, an official with the Republican National Committee said in a video first obtained by ProPublica.\n\nJoe Neild made the comments on one of the Republican Party’s election integrity calls. The party holds them often in battleground states to train poll workers and poll watchers. In the video, an unnamed participant asks Neild, “How do you know if they are illegal aliens? How can you spot that?”\n\n“If they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be inside the pollbook, because if they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be able to register to vote because they’ll need a drivers license number or a Social Security number,” Neild said. He said Pennsylvania requires proof of citizenship in order to get a drivers license.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Republican National Committee for comment. A voicemail left for Neild was not immediately returned.\n\nBrian Hughes, a senior advisor for Trump campaign, told USA TODAY that the party worker was training poll watchers appropriately about what their role is and isn’t. “One of the things you can’t do is become an enforcement mechanism in whether or not someone is a citizen to vote,” Hughes said.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\n'F around and find out': Philly DA delivers harsh warning against election interference\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner delivered a stern warning on Monday for anyone who plans to interfere or intimidate voters on Election Day after concerns of \"frivolous, bogus, challenges\" being brought to eligible voters.\n\n\"Everybody in this city is working and has been working for months to make sure that there will be nothing tough about (voting) and nothing to fear in that experience,\" he said.\n\nKrasner added: \"But I also wanna be clear, anybody who thinks it's time to play militia, F around and find out. Anybody who thinks it's time to insult, to deride, to mistreat, to threaten people, F around and find out. We do have the cuffs, we do have the jail cells, we do have the Philly juries, and we do have the state prisons. So if you're going to try and turn an election into some form of coercion, if you're going to try and bully people, bully votes or voters, try to erase votes, try any of that nonsense, we're not playing. F around and find out.\"\n\nKrasner literally said the letter \"F,\" pronounced \"eff,\" not the actual curse word.\n\nVoters are encouraged to contact the Election Protection hotline, a national, nonpartisan service should they encounter any voting irregularities: 866-OUR-VOTE.\n\nKrasner gave a final message to those intending to disrupt election proceedings: \"You can have your fun in a jail cell, because that's what's coming.\"\n\n-Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nDo not expect final results on Election Night.\n\nElection workers have never completed ballot counting on Election Day at any point in the country's history. This year, local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nIn recent decades, news outlets have typically called the presidential race late on election night or the morning after, with two notable exceptions. In 2000, a famously close race and legal challenges dragged out the process — things likely to affect this year's cycle. In 2020, a rise in mail-in ballots during the COVID pandemic delayed results.\n\nThis year, state laws still in place in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin prohibiting election workers from counting early votes until Election Day are expected to delay results again.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nNorth Carolina sets record turnout in early voting despite hurricane damage\n\nNearly 4.5 million ballots in North Carolina were cast during early voting that ended Saturday, a new high-water mark above the 3.6 million cast during early voting in 2020, officials said.\n\nHurricane Helene heavily damaged 25 counties in the western part of the state. But turnout in those counties was 2 percentage points higher than in the rest of the rest, according to the state Board of Elections\n\nKaren Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state board of elections, called the workers and voters in the western counties “an inspiration to us all.”\n\nThe turnout included 4.2 million people who voted early in person and about 250,000 absentee ballots.\n\nAbout 57% of registered voters statewide have cast ballots. Up to another 1.5 million people are expected to vote on Election Day, according to Bob Phillips, the state’s executive director of Common Cause, a voting-rights advocacy group.\n\n“This has been a historic voter turnout for North Carolina,” Phillips said. “We’ve seen a lot of enthusiasm.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nFBI unveils election command post\n\nThe FBI has reported some foreign cyber-attacks during early voting in the 2024 election, but officials said it was not a major increase from 2020 as the agency opened its command post to respond to coordinate its response to election threats with other federal agencies, state and local authorities.\n\n“The threat reporting we’re getting in here is not a huge volume increase, but people are more aware of reporting information to the FBI,” James Barnacle, deputy assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division, told reporters during a tour Monday. “We have had some foreign malign influence operations and some attempted cyber attacks where adversaries are trying to hit the secretaries of state or state governments or local governments and cause issues with their infrastructure.”\n\nRussia, China and Iran are trying to influence the election, he said. For example, a video circulating in late October falsely portrayed the destruction of ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which federal officials labeled a Russian hoax.\n\nThe FBI election command office has about 80 people from 12 agencies on hand at any time from agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Secret Service; the postal inspection service, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. The office opened on Friday and will remain open until at least Nov. 9.\n\n“This command post is a little more robust than it’s been in the past,” Barnacle said.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service prepare Washington and Florida for Election Day\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service is working to secure locations in the nation's capital and Palm Beach County, Florida, where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will be on election night, respectively.\n\nThe agency said it is working with federal, state, and local partners to ensure heightened levels of safety. Fencing and other physical public safety measures will be installed around the White House, National Observatory, and the Palm Beach County Convention Center.\n\n\"These enhancements are not in response to any specific issue but are part of wide-ranging public safety preparations for Tuesday's election,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nMusk Super PAC argues his $1 million giveaway not a lottery, DA says it’s illegal\n\nElon Musk's pro-Trump Super PAC picks winners of its $1 million-a-day giveaway based on who would be good spokespeople for its agenda and not registered voters at random, a lawyer for the tech billionaire said in court on Monday.\n\nChris Gober, a lawyer for Musk’s PAC political action committee made that argument in an effort to persuade a Pennsylvania judge that the giveaway was not an \"illegal lottery,\" as Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner alleges in a lawsuit seeking to block the payments ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn response, Krasner took the stand to say the $1 million daily giveaways in the seven swing states expected to decide the election were indeed an illegal lottery. He also told Judge Angelo Foglietta that some Pennsylvania residents had been \"scammed for their information\" and called the giveaway a \"grift\" aimed at political marketing.\n\nIn his initial giveaways, Musk described it as a lottery-like system but changed the public messaging after legal experts – and, reportedly, the Justice Department – raised questions about its legality.\n\n\"There is no prize to be won, instead recipients must fulfill contractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the PAC,\" Gober said in the hearing before Foglietta.\n\nThe hearing in the key swing state comes just one day before Musk’s favored candidate Trump faces off against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in a tightly contested race.\n\n−Josh Meyer and Reuters\n\nFew problems with early voting: expert\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department election lawyer who is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said there were no significant problems with early voting such as voter intimidation or violent confrontations.\n\n“Election officials prepared for anything and everything,” Becker said. “But we saw no real issues.”\n\nWith about 80 million early votes cast, Becker said only isolated incidents were reported, such as a man with a machete was reported in Florida.\n\nMistakes that Becker described as normal included a shortage of staffers to handle mail ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania; an estimated 13,000 to 17,000 voters in Erie County, Pennsylvania, not receiving absentee ballots; and about 3,000 voters in Cobb County, Georgia, who didn’t get ballots. In each case, courts granted extra time for voters to receive and then return ballots.\n\n“This is normal,” Becker said. “This has been handled appropriately.”−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump jokes that Joe Biden likes him more than Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump at his rally in North Carolina on Monday morning said that Joe Biden said he liked Trump more than Kamala Harris. Minutes later he clarified that the comment was a joke.\n\n“Here’s news it’s breaking today. Sleepy Joe Biden has announced officially that he likes Trump more than he likes Kamala,” Trump said. The crowd roared with cheers.\n\nLater in his speech, Trump said he was “only kidding about Joe.”\n\n“He didn't officially say that,” Trump said. “When I say it's official. No, no, I'm only kidding.”\n\nBiden has made no such announcement. The president endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nNonpartisan election expert warns against Russian disinformation videos\n\nDavid Becker, director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, urged voters Monday to be skeptical of any videos that could be Russian disinformation aimed at dividing Americans in the wake of the presidential election.\n\nOne recent example is a viral video showing mail ballots destroyed in Pennsylvania, which federal investigators said was a Russian hoax.\n\n\"We're going to see a lot of that,\" Becker warned. \"Any videos you see -- vote flipping, people claiming to have committed voter fraud, people claiming that voter fraud was rampant because of what they saw someone else do. Everyone should be wary of any videos or claims made on social media, the Russians are behind a lot of this.\"\n\nThe federal government has been acting quickly to identify which videos were made by Russians to influence the election, he added.\n\n\"It's clearly designed to incite anger on the part of supporters of a losing candidate and divide us as a nation and make us hate our fellow Americans.\"\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nTrump promises new tariff, this time on Mexico\n\nDonald Trump vowed to immediately enact a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico during a rally in Raleigh, N.C. on Monday as punishment if the country doesn’t help the U.S. decrease the flow of immigration.\n\nTrump argued the proposal has an “100% chance of working” because if the 25% tariff doesn’t work, he’ll squeeze the country with a 50% or 75% tariff.\n\nIf elected, Trump has proposed enacting a variety of other tariffs, which act as taxes on imported goods, including a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on goods from around the world.\n\nThe policies are designed to bolster U.S. manufacturing, but economists have said the proposals would raise prices on U.S. consumers and reduce economic growth by leading to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs on Mexico could have a widespread impact, as Mexico is the No. 1 trading partner for the U.S.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nSenate polling roundup: Democrats retain advantage in toss-up races, though Republicans have edge on retaking chamber\n\nA wave of polling released Monday and over the weekend continue to show Republicans with an edge on retaking the U.S. Senate. Democrats retain an advantage in key battleground states.\n\nThe Cook Political Report has named Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the four toss-up Senate races. All these seats are currently held by Democrats.\n\nFive new polls from Pennsylvania give Democratic Sen. Bob Casey a 1- to 5-point lead in the Keystone State, while one poll indicates the race is tied and one gives GOP challenger David McCormick a 1-point lead.\n\nTwo new Michigan polls found the race between former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is tied. Four polls gave Slotkin a lead between 2 and 8 percentage points, while one gave Rogers a 1-point lead.\n\nFour new polls from Wisconsin give incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a 1- to 6-point lead, while one poll indicates she is tied with GOP challenger Eric Hovde. One poll gives Hovde a 1-point lead.\n\nAnd in Ohio -- the toss-up state recognized as most likely to flip to Republicans -- one new poll showed Sen. Sherrod Brown's opponent, Bernie Moreno, with a 1-point lead.\n\nArizona and Nevada are expected to slightly favor Democrats, and new polls indicate that is still the case. In Nevada, three polls say Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen has a 2- to 9-point advantage over Republican candidate Sam Brown, while one has the race tied.\n\nIn Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Reuben Gallego is running against former TV anchor Kari Lake, four new polls gave Gallego a 2- to 8-point advantage.\n\nTo retake control of the chamber, Republicans only need to flip two seats. They've already got one in the bag: West Virginia, as Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring and a Republican is sure to win his spot.\n\nDemocrats are hoping they can make up for potential losses in Ohio and Montana by beating vulnerable Republicans in Florida and Texas. But two new polls from Morning Consult found voters preferred incumbent Republican Sens. Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas by 3 percentage points each.\n\nYou can read more about each of these polls in detail here.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nHow to follow results on election night\n\nYou can follow along with the USA TODAY Network's hub, which will show election results as they are coming in from around the country especially in critical swing states that could determine the outcome of the campaign between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIt will also feature the dozens of House and Senate races that will also determine who controls Congress.Live results and analysis will also be featured on USATODAY.com, along with our livestream.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the Associated Press will also offer a digital livestream of Tuesday night's US presidential election results. The inaugural AP VoteCast broadcast will include expert discussions, live vote counts and electoral map updates every 30 minutes, as well as rallies, and results from over 35 cameras nationwide.\n\n–Josh Meyer\n\nIs New Hampshire in play for Trump?\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance diverged from his usual swing state stops on Sunday to rally support in New Hampshire just two days before the presidential election.\n\nHe predicted a Trump victory in the New England state, which has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2004. Although, Trump did come close to flipping the state with a libertarian reputation in 2016.\n\n“What we’re doing is expanding the map,” Vance said. “I believe in two days; we will turn New Hampshire red.”\n\nBut Trump winning New Hampshire is still a long shot. A recent Saint Anselm College survey of New Hampshire voters showed Harris leading Trump by 5 points, 51%-46%.\n\n– Margie Cullen and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward media at Pennsylvania rally Sunday\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that a potential assassin would have to shoot through the news media to hit him.\n\nIn a wide-ranging speech Sunday morning in which he also repeated unfounded claims about voter fraud, Trump ramped up his rhetoric against journalists. Pointing to the protective glass surrounding him, he said, “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that.”\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the president's comments weren't about the press, but instead about his own personal safety in light of the two assassination attempts against him earlier this year.\n\nTrump's comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric. Last week, Trump suggested that rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who has endorsed Harris and become one of the former president's most vocal GOP critics.\n\n– Josh Meyer and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen will we know the results on Election Day?\n\nDon't expect final results on election night. Local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nAn increase in mail-in ballots amid the COVID pandemic delayed results in 2020. It took four days for votes to be counted and for news outlets to call the race for President Joe Biden. In 2016, the race was called for Donald Trump in the early hours of the next morning.\n\nIt is unclear how long vote counting will take this year, but legal challenges may also drag out the process of confirming a winner, as they did in the 2000 election.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat time do the polls open and close?\n\nMost states will allow voters to cast their ballots between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Election Day. However, polling hours on Nov. 5 will vary by locations.\n\nFor example, in some areas of Vermont, polls will open as early as 5 a.m. and in New York, polls will close as late as 9 p.m. Check with your state or local election office or its website to find the correct time to vote in your area.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Voter Guide details everything you need to know about making sure your voice is heard in this year’s general election.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat companies are offering Election Day deals?\n\nRideshare companies Uber and Lyft are offering discounted trips for voters, while Hertz has a car rental deal, should you need some transportation to the polls on Nov. 5.\n\nSome restaurants are also offering freebies, including Krispy Kreme, which will hand out free Original Glazed doughnuts and \"I Voted\" stickers at participating U.S. locations on Election Day.\n\nIf voters are still hungry as they wait for results to roll in, Grubhub+ members will have access to an array of discounted deals and Uber Eats is offering 25% off on Election Night orders.\n\n– Mike Snider and Rachel Barber\n\nTrump reportedly gets FCC 'equal time' after Kamala Harris appears on NBC’s 'SNL'\n\nNBC filed a notice with the Federal Communications Commission saying it would provide former President Donald Trump with \"equal time\" following a brief appearance by Vice President Kamala Harris on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHarris appeared on the sketch comedy show Saturday in a skit offering advice in the mirror to comedian Maya Rudolph, who has played Harris in the leadup to the election.\n\nFollowing her brief appearance, Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on X that it was a \"clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule.\" The Trump appointee suggested NBC should offer equal time to \"other qualifying campaigns.\"\n\nIn the notice filed Sunday, NBC said Harris appeared \"without charge\" on \"SNL\" for 1 minute and 30 seconds. In response, NBC provided Trump airtime Sunday, allowing him to directly address viewers during the NASCAR 2024 Cup playoff race, CNN's Brian Stelter reported.\n\nThe FCC's equal time rule requires American radio and television broadcast stations to provide equal access to competing political candidates. The rules do not apply to cable channels or other video content, including podcasts or social media.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nBest 'I voted' sticker designs from USA TODAY readers\n\nHave you voted?

However, after backlash from a Trump rally speaker’s statement against Puerto Rico and a new poll showing Harris has a chance in red Iowa, Trump is now standing at –138 and Harris at +120.\n\nOther betting odds have similarly tightened.\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization.\n\n-- James Powel and Rachel Barber\n\nLatest New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump, Harris deadlocked in key states\n\nWith just hours until Election Day, polls are continuing to show a tight presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump\n\nSwing state polls published by the New York Times and Sienna College on Sunday showed Kamala Harris narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia, while Trump led in Arizona. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two pivotal blue wall states, Harris and Trump were locked in a dead heat.\n\nBut the results in every state were within the survey’s margin of error of ±3.5%, meaning the leads could be statistical errors and aren’t definite. Both candidates are counting on winning a combination of the seven swing states to get them to 270 electoral votes in the electoral college.\n\n-- Karissa Waddick\n\nAre banks open on election day?\n\nBranches of Bank of America, Truist, PNC, Capital One, Wells Fargo and other banks will be open their regular hours on Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nOther banking services, such as ATMs and online banking, should also be available as usual on Election Day.\n\n-- Gabe Hauari\n\nIs election day a federal holiday?\n\nElection Day is not a federal holiday.\n\nSome states do, however, observe Election Day as a holiday.

But today The Times said security sources have “emphasised that all avenues were being explored as they examined the killing”.\n\nOne of these lines of enquiry, said the newspaper, is whether Amess’s ties with Qatar might be linked to his death. The Times described him as the British politician closest to the Gulf kingdom, which backs the current Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. The Conservative MP chaired the all-party parliamentary group on Qatar and had visited the country just last week.\n\n“According to some observers, Somalia’s woes largely stem from the alliance Mohamed made with Doha,” said The Times’s David Rose. President Mohamed clung on to power when his four-year term was due to end in February, triggering the worst political violence the country had seen for many years.\n\nFears of Qatar’s increasing hold has provoked “a backlash from young Somalis, who express their anger on social media, too afraid to take to the streets”, he added.\n\nMI5 ‘mystfied’\n\nAnother theory reported in The Telegraph is that Amess was not specifically targeted, but “picked at random as part of a plot to kill any national politician”.\n\nInvestigators believe Ali acted as a “lone wolf” in what they call a “low-sophistication” plot with little planning, said the paper. One source inside government told the Telegraph that Amess was simply “unlucky”.\n\nThe newspaper said this theory would appear to “scotch” claims that Amess, a devout Catholic, was selected “because of his values, views or religion”.\n\nThe Daily Mail said that MI5 was also “mystified” as to why Amess might have been singled out.\n\nThe Prevent referral\n\nAli is understood to have been referred to the flagship anti-extremism scheme Prevent in his “late teens”, which coincided with “a deterioration in his relationship with his Somali-born parents”, said the Mail.\n\nHowever, he was “never a formal subject of interest to MI5”, said the BBC, which explained that engagement in the Prevent scheme is “voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction”.\n\n“Teachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives,” it added.\n\nRadicalisation\n\nPolice and security services believe the motivation behind the attack may have been to “further the Islamist cause espoused by groups such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State and al-Shabab, which is active in Somalia”, said The Telegraph.\n\nAli does have Somali heritage, it added, but he was born in the UK, grew up in Croydon and it is not thought he had made any recent trips there.\n\nHis father, Harbi Ali Kullane, a former director of communications for the prime minister’s office in Somalia, was a victim of Islamist death threats himself, said The Telegraph. Al-Shabaab, the terror movement that still controls parts of the country, had reportedly targeted him over the hard line he took against terrorism when he lived in the country.\n\nKullane, who now lives in north London, told The Sunday Times that he was feeling “very traumatised” after his son was arrested. “It’s not something that I expected or even dreamt of.”\n\nSo far, Whitehall sources say there is nothing to suggest Ali had extensive contact with terror groups abroad, said The Independent. But detectives are thought to be looking at the possibility that he “may have been ‘self-radicalised’ online by material found on the internet and social media networks during lockdown”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Devika Rao", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/19/democratic-national-convention-live-updates-chicago-kamala-harris-tim-walz/74800541007/", "title": "Democratic convention replay: Biden passes the torch to Harris", "text": "President Joe Biden took the stage on Monday at the Democratic National Convention, passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris after he chose not to seek another term in office.\n\nThe president reflected on his 50-year career in politics, his decision to end his reelection bid and the Democratic Party's future as he addressed Democrats in Chicago and pivotal voters across the country.

After being told by doctors “with 100% certainty” that they would lose their baby, the pair said they had to wait days until Amanda Zurawski was “sick enough” to receive abortion care.\n\n“I’m here tonight because the fight for reproductive rights isn’t just a woman’s fight,” said Josh Zurawski. “This is about fighting for our family and, as Kamala Harris, says our future.”\n\nJoining the Zurawskis was Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana and Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, who each shared their own emotional stories.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a choice,” said Duvall, who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather and became pregnant at 12 years old. “But today, that’s the reality for many women and girls across the country.”\n\n\"What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?\" Duvall added.\n\nThe group’s appearance and joint remarks come as reproductive rights weigh heavily on the first post-Roe presidential election.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nAndy Beshear says reproductive rights on the line in 2024\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was on the shortlist to be Harris’ vice president, accused former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance of attacking reproductive rights.\n\n“Here's the thing, Trump and Vance simply don't believe in your freedom. Trump says people are absolutely thrilled that women have their basic rights eliminated. JD then says women should stay in violent marriages and the pregnancies resulting from rape are simply inconvenient…That's not inconvenient, it's just plain wrong,” he said.\n\nThe former president has backed individual states setting their own abortion restrictions, but he has often celebrated the three Supreme Court justices he appointed who were pivotal in overturning Roe v.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., in his speech said little about Harris, opting to use the majority of his time on stage to condemn Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nRaskin, who served on the House committee investigating the insurrection following the 2020 election, described violent details from that day, including rioters’ chants of, “Hang Mike Pence.”\n\n“Someone should have told Donald Trump that the president’s job under Article II of the Constitution is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,” Raskin told the crowd, “not that the vice president is executed.”\n\nIn an election where fears about democracy are among voter anxieties, Raskin raised alarms about a potential second Trump administration.\n\n“Make no mistake, a man who uses fraud, theft and violence to take power will commit any crime to keep it,” Raskin said.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nClyburn praises Biden for backing Harris\n\nRep.

You can feel it - something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time.”\n\nClinton, who unsuccessfully ran for president against Trump in 2016, said that the party is writing a “new chapter in America’s story.” Harris could be the country's first female president.\n\n“My friends, the future is here,” she said. “I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see us. They would say, keep going.”\n\nShe also knocked Trump, saying that it is no surprise the former president “is lying about Kamala's record. He's mocking her name and her laugh sounds familiar, but we have him on the run now.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nOcasio-Cortez references cease-fire in convention address\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised Harris on stage, citing a variety of the vice president’s priorities – including “working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a member of the House’s progressive “Squad,” has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war has raged on. Some members of that progressive wing have faced pressure from constituents for taking similar positions, including Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri and Rep.

And as you guys know, a lot of good stuff has happened in this building, especially in the nineties. You young people, google Michael Jordan and you can read all about it.”\n\nBut on a more serious note, Kerr said good leaders are those who tell the truth, possesses knowledge and expertise, and care for and love the people they are leading.\n\n“When you think about it that way, this is no contest with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” Kerr said. “I see all those qualities. They have devoted their lives to serving other people.”\n\nKerr encouraged the crowd to get out and vote for Harris and Walz in November.\n\n“And after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry.

All we have to do is look at the track record,\" Fain said. \"When Donald Trump was president, corporate America ran wild. Donald Trump did not bring back the auto industry.\"\n\nThe union leader said the 2024 election \"comes down to one question.\"\n\n\"Which side are you on?\" Fain said. \"On one side, we have Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the working class.

Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month after several Democratic lawmakers, donors and others in the party expressed concerns about the president since his dismal debate performance in June.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s claims Monday at the Democratic National Convention, Biden jabbed Trump's \"stability\" to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocratic convention (James Taylor's version)\n\nKicking off the first night of the Democratic convention is award-winning singer-songwriter James Taylor.\n\nHis performance comes before the night’s keynote speaker, President Joe Biden.

He spoke at length about a House Republican impeachment report, though it seems unlikely the GOP will pursue a case against Biden now that he is out of the presidential race.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris calls for raising corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nKamala Harris would propose raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% if she’s elected president in November, her campaign said on Monday.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson James Singer said the tax increase would be aimed at putting money “back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.\"\n\nThe proposal follows a broader economic plan Harris laid out last week seeking to ban price gouging on food and groceries, lower prescription drug costs and aid first-time homebuyers, among other measures.

Planned Parenthood bus providing no-cost service and vasectomies\n\nPlanned Parenthood has placed reproductive rights front and center at this year’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago and is offering free vasectomies, medication abortions and emergency contraceptives to attendees through its mobile health bus.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Great Rivers of St. Louis announced on X that its bus will be in Chicago on Monday and Tuesday to provide these services, directly challenging the shifting landscape of reproductive rights in the United States since the last Democratic convention, after the U.S. Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022.\n\n– Brandi D. Addison\n\nJohn Fetterman is skipping the DNC. Here’s why\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told The Free Press that he is skipping the Democratic National Convention, dismissing speculation that it has to do with his pro-Israel stance.\n\n“I’ve got three young kids, and they’re out of school,” he said. “That’s four days I can spend with my children.”\n\nFetterman has become one of his party’s most outspoken supporters of Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year. He’s on an island apart from his Democratic peers, who have struck a balance between supporting Israel’s interest in self defense and condemning the attacks on the Gaza Strip.\n\nFetterman told the Press that his decision to skip the convention was “made well before” the June 27 presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Biden dropped out of the 2024 race following his dismal performance.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Riley Beggin\n\nWhen is DNC 2024?\n\nThe DNC is scheduled to take place August 19 through August 22.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nRetired Republican judge J. Michael Luttig endorses Kamala Harris\n\nRetired federal appeals court Judge J. Michael Luttig, a prominent conservative, endorsed Harris for president, CNN first reported.\n\n“In the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law,” Luttig wrote in a statement obtained by CNN. “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the Presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.”\n\nLuttig added in the statement that because of Trump’s continued denial of the 2020 election results, “millions of Americans no longer have faith and confidence in our national elections, and many never will again.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore:Republican-appointed jurist Michael Luttig endorses Harris, citing Trump democracy threat\n\nPro-Palestinian delegates say Kamala Harris' election chances tied to Israel arms embargo\n\nA group of uncommitted delegates to the Democratic National Convention and their allies warned Vice President Kamala Harris Monday that her chances of winning the presidential election are still threatened by her failure to embrace calls for an arms embargo and immediate Israeli cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThey also could not guarantee an absence of disruptions inside the convention hall this week.\n\nUltimately, only about 30 delegates out of 4,995 – less than 1% – were seated as being uncommitted, representing a handful of states.\n\nBut since President Joe Biden ended his reelection effort and Harris secured the votes to become the Democratic nominee late last month, the uncommitted delegates and their allies have been lining up Harris delegates to declare themselves cease-fire delegates and demanding they be given time and space to be heard this week.\n\nRead more about how the Israel-Hamas war is playing out at the convention.\n\n— Todd Spangler and Clara Hendrickson\n\nAOC, Bernie Sanders set to take the stage at the DNC\n\nU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will speak on Monday night at the Democratic convention along with other Democratic rising stars, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov.

They had not yet begun marching as of 11 a.m. Central Time. Demonstrators playing music and periodically chanted \"free, free Palestine\" as they assembled.\n\nBy noon local time, the crowd had swelled to about 1,000 people.\n\nRead more on the Monday demonstrations.\n\n— Trevor Hughes, Michael Loria and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nTim Walz surprises Democrats on first day of Democratic National Convention\n\nA convention hall burst into gasps and cheers as vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz took the stage in a surprise visit to the Democratic National Committee’s Hispanic Caucus meeting Monday morning.\n\nIt was one of a series of unannounced appearances Walz made in an effort to rally attendees as the convention kicked off its first day of activities. He also stopped by a meeting of the Black Caucus and the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania delegation breakfasts meeting Monday.\n\nWalz touted the positive energy and joy he’s feeling out on the campaign trail since he joined Harris on the party's presidential ticket and he pushed those in attendance to keep working to get Democrats elected this fall.\n\n“This is challenging work. This is hard. There's a lot at stake,” he told the Hispanic Caucus as attendees swarmed closer to the stage to take pictures and video. “But that's no different than a lot of people live their lives. It can be challenging and hard, but you can do it with a sense of optimism and, what (Harris) is doing, with a sense of joy, with a sense of joy. To smile.”\n\n“(Republicans) are on her because she laughs,” Walz scoffed. “My God, I'll take someone who laughs any damn day of the week.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\n1968 Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago\n\nIn the lead up to this year's Democratic convention — particularly before President Joe Biden exited the race — 2024 felt a lot like 1968.\n\nAnti-war protests.

An unpopular candidate.\n\nFlashbacks of bloody clashes between police and anti-Vietnam War demonstrators outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago during that chaotic summer weighed heavily on the minds of Democrats earlier this year.\n\nRead more on similarities and differences between 2024 and 1968.\n\n— Michael Collins, David Jackson and Michael Loria\n\nShapiro says his Jewish faith didn’t factor into VP discussions\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro refuted former President Donald Trump’s claims that he was not chosen as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee because of his Jewish faith.\n\n“Antisemitism played absolutely no role in my dialogue with the vice president,” Shapiro told the media after delivering remarks to the Pennsylvania Delegation at the Democratic convention Monday morning.\n\n“He’s trying to use me and he’s trying to use other Jews to divide Americans further,” Shapiro said. “He is the least credible person when it comes to standing up against hatred and bigotry.”\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nMemories of talk show politics: Phil Donahue dies at 88\n\nFollowers of this week's Democratic convention may want to pause and reflect on the death of a fairly influential political figure: Television talk show host Phil Donahue.\n\nIn the spring of 1992, as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton marched toward the Democratic presidential nomination, he included afternoon television talk shows in his media strategy, including a contentious interview with Donahue.\n\nThe high-rated afternoon host peppered Clinton with questions about \"character issues,\" drawing boos from his crowd and admonitions from the candidate.\n\nClinton — who is scheduled to address this week's convention in Chicago — made a complaint that current politicians still echo: “There are real problems in this country, and there are people who’d like to hear them discussed. I’ve done my best to do it, and it’s very difficult.”\n\nDonahue, who always defended his questioning of public officials, died Sunday at age 88.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWalz wades into swing state rivalry: Wawa or Sheetz?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz found himself smack dab in the middle of one Pennsylvania’s mostly hotly contested debates on Monday morning: Wawa or Sheetz.\n\nWhile telling the Pennsylvania delegation at the Democratic convention about his trip through the swing state on Sunday, Walz lauded the popular convenience store and gas station Sheetz. Some in the crowd responded by chanting the name of the rival chain, Wawa. He received some boos from the Wawa contingent in the delegation.\n\n“Here’s my thing – Kwik Trip. In the Midwest it’s Kwik Trip,” Walz answered to laughs.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nMore:Tim Walz says he's 'a Kwik Trip guy' but the company has big ties to Trump\n\nWhy Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown and Jacky Rosen are skipping the Democratic convention\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester is headed to a party this week. It's just going to be Pearl Jam's instead of Vice President Kamala Harris' in Chicago.\n\nTester joins vulnerable Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada in skipping the Democratic National Convention to focus on their must-win races instead, their campaigns confirmed. At least a couple House Democrats facing similar political headwinds back home are skipping a trip to the Windy City, too.\n\nRead more on the Democrats skipping the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week.\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nPennsylvania campaign stop:Harris brings back Chuck Taylors as she makes 2024 campaign her own\n\nWhat's on the Democratic convention's schedule for Monday?\n\nThe convention's first night will pay tribute to the 81-year-old Democratic president, and other Democratic heavyweights, such as Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, are also expected to speak at the convention.\n\nThe convention speaker schedule is subject to change and a full list of speakers will be released at a later time.

The Secret Service says it's ready. Local leaders say they're ready. Residents? Maybe not so much.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 delegates, politicians and party activists are expected to attend this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, with possibly tens of thousands of demonstrators marching through the streets.\n\nFences, barricades and parked snow plows have already limited movement in key downtown areas, with helicopters buzzing overhead.\n\nRead more on how Chicago is preparing for the convention.\n\n— Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins and Michael Loria\n\nBiden has changed course over his 50-year career. None of that compares to his 2024 choice.\n\nJoe Biden wasn’t ready to go away.\n\nHe’d had his eyes on the presidency for years. Now it was his, and he wasn’t about to quit. So he raised campaign money, put together a campaign team and hit the campaign trail. He was running for another term and, he was convinced, he was going to win.\n\nA bad night on a debate stage in Atlanta changed everything. Now, just seven weeks later, he will address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday, not as the party’s presidential nominee but as an outgoing president passing the torch to a potential successor and a new generation.\n\nRead more on Biden's decision to withdraw from the race.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nSome Trump voters are denying Harris' progress — but others say they're worried\n\nMany supporters of former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, who attended a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Saturday expressed skepticism about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' rise in the polls. They projected confidence that Trump has the race under control.\n\nOthers, though, were nervous.\n\nThe MAGA movement’s mood Saturday, a month into a changed race that has seen Harris surging nationally and in key swing states, percolated the arena with a mix of emotions.\n\nRead more on the mood from Saturday's Trump rally.\n\n— Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWait, Kamala Harris is already the nominee?\n\nTraditionally, delegates from all 50 states and the U.S. territories assemble at a convention and elect their chosen party's candidate for president. It's a time to trumpet achievements, criticize opponents' policies, and rally behind their leaders to build enthusiasm for Election Day.\n\nDemocrats are still going to lay out their vision for the country during the Democratic convention. But the actually nominating process looks different this year. That's because the DNC confirmed Harris/Walz during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 due to ballot deadlines in some states, with 99% of the participating delegates supporting Harris.\n\nHarris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later, but they will formally accept at the convention. Democrats are expected to have a ceremonial vote at the convention for the ticket, but their nominations are already final.\n\n— Marina Pitofsky and C. A.

Former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is also slated to deliver a speech.\n\nBiden will speak Monday night during an opening evening of the convention that will pay tribute to the 81-year-old Democratic president, who last month ended his reelection campaign. Hillary Clinton will also address the convention Monday.\n\nObama is expected to speak Tuesday night, while Bill Clinton will deliver remarks Wednesday night before Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz gives his address\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rachel Barber\n\nIs Michelle Obama speaking at the Democratic convention?\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will address the Democratic National Convention in her native city of Chicago on Tuesday, multiple sources have confirmed with USA TODAY.\n\nMichelle Obama, one of the most popular Democratic figures, joins an all-star lineup, including her husband, former President Barack Obama, who are rallying the party faithful in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is surging in polls ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe party's theme on Tuesday is slated to be \"A Bold Vision for America’s Future.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhere is the DNC?\n\nThe convention will be in Chicago, just 90 miles south of Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention was recently held.\n\nThe Democratic Party has held a national convention every four years since 1832 to nominate its chosen candidates, and Chicago has a storied history of hosting conventions on both sides of the political aisle dating back to 1860, with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times, this will be the Windy City’s 26th political convention.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nWhat happens at the DNC?\n\nUnlike the RNC, the DNC decided to confirm their nominee during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 to satisfy ballot deadlines in several states. According to a press release, 99% of participating delegates supported Kamala Harris in the virtual roll call, and Harris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later.\n\nHowever, Harris has not yet formally accepted the nomination, which she will do at the convention in Chicago.\n\nIn the meantime, there is still plenty left to do for the Democratic delegates. The DNC offers them a chance to adopt and unify a comprehensive party platform, taking a stance on issues like reproductive rights, immigration and economic policy. They'll also have a kind-of ceremonial vote for Harris, but her position as Democratic nominee is already final\n\nThe Democratic Party will post updates on its convention website, which can be found at demconvention.com.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nDonald Trump plans counterprogramming during the DNC\n\nAs Trump prepared to speak to voters in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, he and aides finalized plans to counter this week's proceedings at the Democratic convention − and to play defense as Harris basks in the glow of her formal nomination to the presidency.\n\nTrump aides said they believe Harris will gain in the polls in the wake of the convention that kicks off Monday – most major party nominees do − and they are working to counteract that as the election heads into the final two months.\n\nTrump, vice presidential nominee JD Vance, and other campaign officials will conduct a series of anti-Harris events in key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.

Coaches, at least on the winning team, prefer the night shower or bath right after the big game. Their choice of soap?\n\nGatorade.\n\nFlavors and colors may vary, but the whole charade has become a popular way to bet on the Super Bowl. To put it another way, countless people will wager on how someone will shower or bathe after one of the world's most significant sporting events.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThis money-making operation only continues to grow in popularity as the years go by, but there's no denying it's a fun way to potentially make some cash as the NFL season concludes.\n\nHere's how the NFL's Gatorade tradition was born, this year's odds for the prop bet and which one we're throwing some spare change down on this year.\n\nSUPER BOWL ODDS:Eagles vs. Chiefs: Latest betting update, moneyline\n\nEAGLES VS. CHIEFS STATS:How Super Bowl 59 teams stack up, predicting who has edge\n\nSuper Bowl Gatorade history\n\nInitially done in the 1980s, the Gatorade bath is most often associated with the New York Giants. Performed by Jim Burt, a defensive tackle for the team, he dumped the sports drink over head coach Bill Parcells following a 17-3 victory over Washington during the 1985 season.\n\nYet it wasn't for the purposes of celebration like it would be today.\n\nBurt was dealing with endless criticism from Parcells all week leading up to the game. After the win, Burt opted to douse his head coach in retaliation, something the defensive tackle says helped him avoid bullying from the coach going forward.\n\nFrom that point forward, teammate Harry Carson stepped up and continued the tradition, saying Parcells believed in the superstition.\n\nThe Giants carried the tradition to a victory in Super Bowl 21 the following season.\n\nHowever, the actual origin of the famous Gatorade celebration is somewhat disputed. Despite typically being credited to the Giants, Chicago Bears' players Steve McMichael and Mike Singletary dumped the drink onto Mike Ditka's head a year prior.\n\nBetting on the Gatorade color wasn't legalized until the 2019 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots. The color was purple in each of the last two seasons when the Kansas City Chiefs won, with blue the two years before that. Orange rounds out the last five seasons, which also came in a Chiefs' victory.\n\nWith Kansas City slight favorites to win this year, purple again tops the list of Gatorade odds at +225.\n\nWhat is the most popular Gatorade color?\n\nOrange has been the most popular Gatorade color at the Super Bowl since 2001. Purple, blue, clear/water and no Gatorade at all each check in with four, while yellow/green has been represented three times.\n\nPurple figures to be a popular bet this year as the Chiefs target the first three-peat in NFL history, considering they used it each of the last two seasons. The Philadelphia Eagles opted for yellow/green when they won Super Bowl 52, so it makes sense that history has boosted those odds to the top of the board.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting nugget from this novelty prop is that red Gatorade, arguably the most popular flavor, hasn't made a single appearance in the 21st century. So maybe the world didn't end during Y2K, but it certainly left the fruit punch-flavored Gatorade behind.\n\nMORE:Xavier Worthy's journey to Super Bowl 59 started with a text from Patrick Mahomes\n\nSuper Bowl 2025 Gatorade color odds\n\nOdds provided courtesy of BetMGM:\n\nPurple (+225)\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+250)\n\nOrange (+400)\n\nBlue (+650)\n\nRed/Pink (+650)\n\nClear/Water (+900)\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+2500)\n\nSuper Bowl Gatorade color by year\n\nSuper Bowl 58, Kansas City Chiefs: Purple\n\nPurple Super Bowl 57, Kansas City Chiefs: Purple\n\nPurple Super Bowl 56, Los Angeles Rams: Blue\n\nBlue Super Bowl 55, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Blue\n\nBlue Super Bowl 54, Kansas City Chiefs: Orange\n\nOrange Super Bowl 53, New England Patriots: Blue\n\nBlue Super Bowl 52, Philadelphia Eagles: Yellow/Green\n\nYellow/Green Super Bowl 51, New England Patriots: None\n\nNone Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos: Orange\n\nOrange Super Bowl 49, New England Patriots: Blue\n\nBlue Super Bowl 48, Seattle Seahawks: Orange\n\nOrange Super Bowl 47, Baltimore Ravens: None\n\nNone Super Bowl 46, New York Giants: Purple\n\nPurple Super Bowl 45, Green Bay Packers: Orange\n\nOrange Super Bowl 44, New Orleans Saints: Orange\n\nOrange Super Bowl 43, Pittsburgh Steelers: Yellow/Green\n\nYellow/Green Super Bowl 42, New York Giants: Clear\n\nClear Super Bowl 41, Indianapolis Colts: Clear\n\nClear Super Bowl 40, Pittsburgh Steelers: Clear\n\nClear Super Bowl 39, New England Patriots: Clear\n\nClear Super Bowl 38, New England Patriots: None\n\nNone Super Bowl 37, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Purple\n\nPurple Super Bowl 36, New England Patriots: None\n\nNone Super Bowl 35, Baltimore Ravens: Yellow/Green\n\nMORE:Hardest job in Philly?

The New York Giants were known to be superstitious in the 1980s when they popularized the tradition.\n\nStill, there is also the Eagles side of the story. Yellow/green makes sense for them since they previously won with that color. However, what if they lost with that flavor two years ago against the Chiefs? What chaos!\n\nThe bottom line is that your pick likely has some correlation to the winner. While team colors have never been an indicator of which Gatorade reveals itself as the confetti rains down, each team has different preferences that can lead you to a different conclusion.\n\nSince we are going to ride with the Chiefs in Super Bowl 59, we're willing to take the plunge on history.\n\nThink about it.\n\nNo NFL team has ever won three straight Super Bowls. Red Gatorade hasn't been used, at least, since \"hanging chads\" were a thing. With history at stake and Kansas City in a great spot to deliver, it only makes sense to dump some red Gatorade on Andy \"Big Red\" Reid.\n\nAt +650, this makes for a fun long-shot wager after the big game ends.\n\nNo matter your pick, do us a favor and please play responsibly. Now, let's pour a glass of that delicious fruit punch Gatorade to celebrate another fun season.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/02/02/super-bowl-prop-bets-2018-propositions-and-how-works/300338002/", "title": "Super Bowl LII prop bets: 2018 propositions and how it works", "text": "Super Bowl Sunday is nearly here, which means it's time to place your proposition bets. A proposition bet, or prop bet, is a wager on the occurrence or non-occurrence during a game or an event not directly affecting the outcome.\n\nA typical prop bet would be on the coin toss, who will be the MVP, or the length of the National Anthem. We've compiled some of the more interesting prop bets for this year's Super Bowl, along with a few thoughts about each one.\n\nNumbers explainer: The betting and payout structure depends on the question.\n\nFor some, there are straight odds, like 2:1, 5:1 or 7:4. If you bet $1 on 2:1 odds and win, you make $2 profit. A 5:1 winning bet earns you $5. A 7:4 winner gets more complicated, but returns winnings of $1.75. For others, there are trickier, plus or minus odds, like +400 or -250. On the +400 wager, someone who bets $1 wins $4. On the -250 bet, if you play $2.50 you net $1.\n\nWhat color will Pink's hair be when she starts to sing the National Anthem?\n\nWhite/blonde: 5/4\n\nPink/red: 7/4\n\nBlue/purple: 5/1\n\nBrown/black: 5/1\n\nGreen: 5/1\n\nDuh.

The 49ers got the ball to start the extra period and got a field goal, but with the new overtime rules, the Chiefs were allowed to get the ball. Then, Mahomes engineered the drive of the season, capped off by a three-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Mecole Hardman to win it all.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s déjà vu for the 49ers, once again blowing a 10-point lead against Kansas City in the title game after doing it in Super Bowl 54. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCHIEFS FANS: Here’s where you can buy the Super Bowl 58 commemorative cover\n\nMost likeable Super Bowl ever. Chiefs, Usher almost make you forget about hating NFL\n\nSuper Bowl 58 really started with Usher. His show took us back in time to old school rhythm and blues, in what was the most gorgeous, stunning Super Bowl halftime show ever. Usher pulled off a neat trick: sensuality and likeability wrapped into a neat, bombastic bow.\n\nThen came the game, and it really started with the second half. And we saw what makes Kansas City so good: stubbornness and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBut after Kansas City won, we saw from that team what we always do: a bunch of likeable people.\n\nBetween Usher, who put on a stunning and likeable show, and Kansas City, who in the end put on an equally stunning and likeable show, this was the most likeable Super Bowl of all time.

He entered with high expectations. Faced adversity. There was redemption and triumph. It was punctuated by an Elvis Presley impersonation, fitting for the first Super Bowl in Las Vegas.\n\n“Vivaaaaaaaaaaaa, Vivaaaaaaaa, Las Vegasssssssssssssss!!” a hoarse Kelce, Lombardi Trophy in hand, scream-sang into the microphone as CBS’ Jim Nantz interviewed him on stage.

It marks the first time New Orleans will host the Super Bowl since 2013. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nWe knew what was going to happen because we’ve seen it before. Several times. So how in the world did the 49ers not know what was coming?\n\nIt might as well be in the Chiefs’ playbook for Super Bowls: Play poorly, fall behind by double digits and, almost always, come back and win. It happened the first time the Chiefs and the Niners played. It happened last year against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAnd it happened again Sunday night. — Nancy Armour\n\nA Super Bowl winning drive that took 13 plays with Taylor Swift in attendance?\n\nBaby just say yes.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs secured their second consecutive Super Bowl title on Sunday after scoring a touchdown in overtime that was the drive of the season for Patrick Mahomes and company. It took 13 plays, seven minutes and 19 seconds for the Chiefs to get into the end zone, their longest drive of the day, and it was capped off by Mecole Hardman's touchdown. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl 58 winners and losers: Patrick Mahomes sparks dynasty, 49ers falter late\n\nThe dynasty otherwise known as the Kansas City Chiefs is here.\n\nThe Chiefs toppled the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58 on Sunday night in Las Vegas, 25-22, to become the first team in 19 seasons to repeat as Super Bowl champions. They have won three titles in the last half decade. And behind it all are the constants, coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who took home his third career Super Bowl MVP award, becoming only the third player in NFL history to do so.\n\nFor the 49ers and coach Kyle Shanahan, it's yet another heartbreak. There's plenty of blame to allocate, but one thing the 49ers should take comfort in is that quarterback Brock Purdy shined on the sport's biggest stage. Here are the winners and losers from Super Bowl 58. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n2024 NFL draft order: All 32 first-round selections set after Super Bowl 58\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime to win Super Bowl 58, thus officially ending the 2023 NFL season and setting the full order for the first round of the 2024 draft. Teams eliminated in the conference championship games pick at Nos. 29 and 30. Teams eliminated during the divisional playoffs occupy spots Nos. 25-28.

It took a bit before any of that registered.\n\nOn the game’s final play, the fifth-year receiver of the Kansas City Chiefs motioned toward the offensive line before pirouetting and looking back at quarterback Patrick Mahomes at the snap. The three-time Super Bowl MVP delivered a quick pass to the receiver, Hardman gathering the ball in and heading toward the pylon for a short 3-yard score that will be long remembered as the play that cemented K.C. as the NFL’s newest dynasty.\n\nNot that Hardman knew.\n\n“I knew I was going to get the ball, caught the football, and I blacked out,” said Hardman after the game. “I’m not going to lie, I blacked out.

It happened again.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers not only fell 25-22 to the Kansas City Chiefs in an overtime thriller in Super Bowl 58, but they did it the hard way, blowing a double-digit lead.\n\nYes, history has repeated itself.

Read Jarrett Bell's full column here.\n\n49ers praise Brock Purdy, bemoan 'self-inflicted wounds' in Super Bowl 58 loss\n\nThe 49ers also had high praise for Purdy, who played in his first Super Bowl. He became a national sensation last year when he stepped in as the third-string quarterback and led the team to the NFC championship. Among his admirers is retired Super Bowl champion Drew Brees.\n\nIn his own Super Bowl, Purdy went 23-of-38 passing for 255 yards and threw the touchdown to Jennings. He opened the season with five straight games without throwing an interception and protected the ball again in the title matchup.\n\n“I thought he did a great job,” Kittle said. “Just throughout the game, I haven’t watched the tape or anything like that, but Brock seemed like his normal self. Delivering the ball when he needed to, put it in tight coverages, I think Brock played a hell of a game.” Read Victoria Hernandez's full story here.\n\nLAS VEGAS — It was hardly a smooth coronation Sunday evening, but after nearly four hours, numerous momentum swings and only the second overtime in Super Bowl history, the Kansas City Chiefs were finally anointed as the NFL’s newest dynasty.\n\nAnd Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Co. more than earned the crown.\n\nDynasty? No doubt. — Nate Davis\n\nSuper Bowl 58 highlights\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the 49ers in overtime, becoming the NFL’s ninth repeat Super Bowl champs.\n\nCBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson interviewed Patrick Mahomes on the field right after the final whistle.\n\n\"The guys never faltered,\" Mahomes said to CBS' Tracy Wolfson on the sideline. \"This is awesome. It’s legendary.\" Wolfson then asked the Super Bowl 58 MVP if the Chiefs are now a dynasty. \"Yeah. It’s the start of one,\" he replied. \"We’re not done. We’ve got a young team we’re going to keep this thing going.\"\n\nDuring the postgame Lombardi Trophy presentation on the podium, Mahomes said the Super Bowl was a reflection of the Chiefs' whole season. \"It was the defense just keeping us in there and then the offense making plays when it counted,\" he said. \"And then, of course, Harrison Butker hitting it from about 70. So it was a microcosm of our whole season. I'm just proud of the guys, they kept believing. And I'm proud of the coaches for calling up those plays that got us some touchdowns there at the end.\n\n\"Just know that the Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that.\"\n\nTravis Kelce opened his comments during the postgame trophy presentation by shouting “Chiefs Kingdom!\" before leading the call-and-response cheer of “Viva Las Vegas” with the crowd.\n\nKelce then looked ahead to what's next, saying the Chiefs have their sights on a third-straight Super Bowl victory. “Well, you know, the goal’s always been to get three, but we couldn’t here without getting to two and having that target on our back all year — and I love these guys right here, the men that we just won this thing with, family forever, baby,\" he said. \"I couldn’t be more proud of you guys, and how about it? We get a chance to do it three times in a row. How do you get excited for that, baby? You party in Las Vegas and then you get back to it.”\n\nHe then led the crowd in a “You gotta fight for your right to party” cheer.\n\nSuper Bowl 2024 Gatorade color\n\nThe Chiefs showered coach Andy Reid with purple Gatorade after their Super Bowl 58 victory. Here's a complete history of Super Bowl Gatorade baths.\n\nLAS VEGAS — Kyle Shanahan with a 10-point lead in a Super Bowl?\n\nGiven the history, this is not what the casinos on The Strip would call playing with house money.\n\nUh-oh. It happened again.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers not only fell 25-22 to the Kansas City Chiefs in an overtime thriller in Super Bowl 58, but they did it the hard way, blowing a double-digit lead.\n\nYes, history has repeated itself. — Jarrett Bell\n\nPatrick Mahomes won Super Bowl 58 MVP as the quarterback led the Kansas City Chiefs to their third title in five years by beating the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime Sunday.\n\nMahomes won the award for the third time in his career. He now is tied with Hall of Famer Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs in NFL history, trailing only Tom Brady, who won five. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker broke a record set by San Francisco 49ers kicker Jake Moody earlier in the game, making a 57-yard field goal attempt in the third quarter. Moody had briefly held the record, which had been held by the Buffalo Bills' Steve Christie (Super Bowl XXVIII), making a 55-yard field goal in the second quarter.\n\nButker connected on four field goal attempts, which tied a Super Bowl record held by the 49ers' Ray Wersching (Super Bowl XVI) and the Green Bay Packers' Don Chandler (Super Bowl II). — Jim Reineking\n\nThe bets were pouring in across the country for Super Bowl 58. And while there were some big boons for bettors during the big game, there were also several moments that spoiled some popular wagers made with BetMGM.\n\nHere are five bad beats that irked a significant number of bettors Sunday night. — Richard Morin\n\nWinners and losers of overtime\n\nWINNERS\n\nLegendary Mahomes\n\nIf he wasn’t already established as an all-time great, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes erased any doubt whatsoever that he is among the best to have ever done it. His uncanny feel for the game and pocket presence, taking stock of where the open spaces on the field are, using his arm or his legs, this is what has allowed the Chiefs to be the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls. The scary part, for the rest of the NFL, at least, Mahomes is only 28 and entering his prime.\n\nChiefs O-line\n\nThough they had been controlled for the majority of the game, Kansas City’s offensive line parried away the 49ers pass rushers in second half. Mahomes’ increased mobility certainly helped neutralize the bite of some of the San Francisco pressure, but Kansas City’s front protected Mahomes plenty on Kansas City’s 13-play, 75-yard game-winning drive. Chiefs gained 208 of their 455 yards — or 45.7% of their offensive output — in the fourth quarter and overtime. It’s no coincidence that this is the time when the Chiefs’ offensive line took over.\n\nLOSERS\n\n49ers defense simply ran out of gas\n\nThis was certainly an example of the inevitability of Patrick Mahomes, as it appeared there would be no doubt the Chiefs would score every time they touched the ball late. But San Francisco’s defense, an elite unit, appeared to lose a step as the game wore on. The injury to Dre Greenlaw contributed, but San Francisco playing soft coverage, perhaps to compensate for fatigue, allowed Mahomes to pick apart the coverages. It also meant that when San Francisco’s defenders dropped back, Mahomes had space to run and gain huge chunks of yards. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs 25, 49ers 22: Kansas City wins Super Bowl 58 in overtime\n\nThe Mahomes magic knows no bounds, and now the Chiefs have their third Super Bowl title in five years.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found Mecole Hardman to cap a 13-play, 75-yard drive and help the Chiefs outlast the 49ers in thrilling fashion.\n\nOn third-and-1, Isiah Pacheco was stopped for no gain, which forced KC to go for it. Then, on a designed run, Patrick Mahomes ran for 8 yards and a first down to keep the Chiefs alive.\n\nAfter a busted play lost 3 yards, Mahomes found Marques Valdes-Scantling for 7 yards and Rashee Rice for 13 yards and a first down into 49ers territory.\n\nMahomes came back with a 19-yard run on third-and-1, being tackled at the 49ers 13. Three plays later the were in the end zone. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 22, Chiefs 19: Jake Moody puts San Francisco head in overtime\n\nThe 49ers’ opening drive in overtime initially didn’t go well. Brock Purdy’s first pass was almost intercepted. Then, on second down, there was a false start. Later in the drive, on third down, a Purdy pass fell incomplete.\n\nBut San Francisco got a huge break with a holding call on Kansas City.\n\nPurdy took advantage of the penalty and started to slowly move the ball down the field. They did so with tight end George Kittle going into the locker room with what CBS said was a shoulder injury. He returned just several minutes later.\n\nSan Francisco took over seven minutes to move deep into Kansas City territory. The drive ended with a Jake Moody field goal from 27 yards. — Mike Freeman\n\nGeorge Kittle injury update\n\nThe 49ers are in overtime of the Super Bowl and experiencing another injury scare.\n\nTight end George Kittle was seen jogging to the locker room during the extra session. CBS sideline reporter Evan Washburn said Kittle was dealing with a right shoulder injury.\n\nKittle was questionable to return but was back on the field later in the 49ers' drive. — Jace Evans\n\nThe NFL's overtime rules for the Super Bowl and postseason have evolved over the years, with the most recent tweak coming in 2022.\n\nThe Super Bowl overtime format is quite similar to what fans are accustomed to in the regular season, with two significant exceptions: Both teams will have the chance to possess the ball and games cannot end in ties. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThere's only been one other Super Bowl to go into overtime\n\nThe New England Patriots' epic win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI was the only previous Super Bowl to go into overtime.\n\nOf course, that game ended on James White's touchdown to win the game for the Patriots, who overcame a 28-3 deficit to force overtime. — Jim Reineking\n\nFourth quarter winners and losers\n\nWINNERS\n\nOffensive execution\n\nThis Super Bowl was something of a late bloomer. It took until the fourth quarter, but both teams easily recorded their best offensive quarters of the game. Each of the four possessions both teams combined to play ended up scores. Both teams combined for 248 yards of offense. Most importantly for fans: the alternating scores ended up with the game tied, giving us an intriguing conclusion to a game that had started slowly\n\nThat Steve Spagnuolo blitz\n\nComing out of the two-minute warning, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo dialed up a perfect blitz that had slot corner Trent McDuffie firing off the edge. Brock Purdy, feeling the heat of the Kansas City rush, fired a quick pass to Jauan Jennings, but McDuffie threw up his hands and deflected the ball. That set up rookie kicker Jake Moody’s 53-yard go-ahead kick, but it gave the Chiefs plenty of time to tie or win the game.\n\nLOSERS\n\nThe second down that preceded it\n\n49ers coach Kyle Shanahan has called a decently solid game, though he did ignore Christian McCaffrey and the running game in the third quarter. With the two-minute warning approaching, Shanahan and the 49ers were facing a second-and-5 from the Kansas City 35-yard line. The play was a pass to tight end George Kittle that went for no gain, setting up a difficult third down, and giving Spagnuolo a perfect chance to bring pressure. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n49ers 19, Chiefs 19: Harrison Butker ties it with three seconds left\n\nIt looks like the Super Bowl is going to overtime for only the second time ever after Harrison Butker made a 29-yard field goal with 3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe drive started when Patrick Mahomes hit Travis Kelce on a 9-yard pass before scrambling for a first down. Then Mahomes found Justin Watson for 8 yards and, on third-and-2, got a pass to Jerick McKinnon for 7 yards to the 49ers 43-yard line with 40 seconds to play.\n\nThe most clutch play came on third-and-7, when Mahomes found Travis Kelce for a 22-yard catch and run to to 49ers 11. That's where the drive ended before Butker's fourth field goal of Super Bowl 58. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 19, Chiefs 16: Jake Moody gives San Francisco late lead\n\nJake Moody missed an extra point on a previous 49ers touchdown but he was ice on what could be the game-deciding kick.\n\nThis one was from 53 yards and he showed no signs of being nervous. The kick was perfect. — Mike Freeman\n\n49ers 16, Chiefs 16: Harrison Butker ties it up\n\nLess than six minutes left in Super Bowl 58, and it’s all knotted up at 16 after Harrison Butker hit his third field goal of the day.\n\nTravis Kelce has been relatively quiet most of Sunday, but came up big with two catches for 29 yards, including on a third-and-10 play to keep the chains moving. Another big play was when Patrick Mahomes found Justin Watson for a 25-yard gain to get them near the red zone.\n\nKansas City was able to get inside the 10-yard line, but wasn’t able to punch it in and had to settle for a 24-yard field goal for the tie. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTravis Kelce receiving yards today\n\nAfter having just one catch for 1 yard in the first half, Travis Kelce's production picked up in the second half.\n\nKelce had nine receptions for 93 yards, with his final catch setting up the Chiefs' game-winning touchdown in overtime.\n\n49ers 16, Chiefs 13: Jauan Jennings scores, but Jake Moody's extra point blocked\n\nOn fourth down, Shanahan decided to go for it and it paid off with a pass to tight end George Kittle, who got the first. Then Jauan Jennings later scored and it looked like the 49ers were going to lead Kansas City, 17-13.\n\nBut kicker Jake Moody missed the extra point and it was instead 16-13. CBS noted that Moody was previously 68 for 68.\n\nThe touchdown for San Francisco reversed what was a terrible third quarter. With 2:23 remaining in it, San Francisco had 13 total yards, -1 passing yards, one giveaway and zero first downs. They were outscored at that point 10-0. — Mike Freeman\n\nWinners and losers from third quarter\n\nWINNERS\n\nMahomes mobility activated\n\nWith San Francisco dictating the line of scrimmage, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made a slight tweak to his game to generate some more momentum for Kansas City: he used his legs more. In the first half, he ran the ball just twice for seven yards. In the third quarter alone, he rushed three times for 26 yards, including a 22-yarder on a third down that set up Harrison Butker’s record-setting 57-yard field goal.\n\nSteve Wilks\n\nSan Francisco defensive coordinator Steve Wilks has his defense completely stifling Patrick Mahomes. The Niner defense is pressuring Mahomes and speeding up his entire operation. They’ve sacked Mahomes twice and have shut down Kansas City in two red zone trips. Mahomes’ third quarter interception was the result of controlled pressure complementing tight coverage down the field. The special teams gaffe close to the end of the third quarter put his defense in a tough spot, and while there was a breakdown in coverage, it’s difficult to fault Wilks’ unit for giving up the score on the short field.\n\nLOSERS\n\nSan Francisco offense stalling in second half\n\nThe 49ers recorded three complete drives in the third quarter. They ran nine plays, gained three yards and posted three three-and-outs. Surprisingly, coach Kyle Shanahan went away from San Francisco’s big strength and primary playmaker; in those three series, running back Christian McCaffrey carried the ball just once for no gain. The good news for the 49ers is that their current drive, which started at the end of the third and is heading into the fourth, appears to be a course correction.\n\nAnd their special teams imploded even worse\n\nIt’s so demoralizing for a defense to get a stop, only for the special teams unit to botch the punt return. That’s precisely what San Francisco did, when the punt caromed off the foot of rookie Darrell Luter Jr. and ended up with the Chiefs recovering. The Chiefs thrive when teams gift them opportunities like this, and Kansas City scored its first touchdown of the day on the following play. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs 13, 49ers 10: Muffed punt results in Marquez Valdes-Scantling TD\n\nAnother big mistake for the San Francisco 49ers leads to the Chiefs taking their first lead of the game.\n\nAfter forcing a three-and-out and a punt, one of the 49ers players appeared to touch Darrell Luter Jr. the ball on the punt, returner Ray-Ray McCloud III tried to pick it up, but he couldn’t get his hands fully on it and the Chiefs recovered it at the 16-yard line.\n\nOn the next play, Patrick Mahomes found Marquez Valdes-Scantling wide open in the end zone for Kansas City’s first touchdown of the day, and gave the Chiefs a 13-0 lead late in the third quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nLAS VEGAS — Two individuals rushed the field during the third quarter of Super Bowl 58 and nearly interrupted a third down play for the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense. One of the disruptors made it all the way to the San Francisco 49ers' sideline, where he was subdued, while his partner in crime — literally, this is trespassing — was tackled by a team of security staffers near the 10-yard line by the Chiefs’ end zone.\n\nBoth shirtless, they must have felt inspired by Usher’s halftime show. — Chris Bumbaca\n\n49ers’ Deebo Samuel returns\n\nThe good news for San Francisco: Deebo Samuel returned after injuring his hamstring.\n\nThe bad news for the 49ers: the offense had its third consecutive three-and-out.\n\nWhat’s become clear is that Kansas City’s defense, after not being able to significantly pressure Purdy in the first half, is doing so now. He’s been figured out. At least for the moment. — Mike Freeman\n\n49ers 10, Chiefs 6: Chiefs add another field goal with history\n\nEarlier in the game, Jake Moody made the longest field goal in Super Bowl history at 55 yards.\n\nThe record lasted one quarter.\n\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker knocked in a 57-yard field goal in the third quarter to break the record of longest field goal in Super Bowl history, and making it a 10-6 49ers lead with 20 minutes left in Super Bowl 58. Butker kicked a 28-yard field goal in the final seconds of the first half for Kansas City’s first points of the game.\n\nIt wasn’t a touchdown, but it was still a win for Kansas City to get points on the board since the offense has been dormant most of the game. The legs of Patrick Mahomes were instrumental in the drive, as he picked up a third down on a scramble and then had a 22-yard run to get the offense in San Francisco territory. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nDeebo Samuel hamstring injury update\n\nAfter seeing Dre Greenlaw go down with an Achilles injury, the San Francisco 49ers are holding their breath again after Deebo Samuel appeared to suffer an injury in the third quarter. The wide receiver was initially listed as questionable to return, but returned to the game.\n\nSamuel appeared to grab his hamstring area late on his route on the 49ers’ unsuccessful third down play, and he went to the grass at Allegiant Stadium with 9:15 remaining in the quarter.\n\nSamuel walked off the field under his own power and made his way to the blue medical tent. — Jace Evans\n\nChiefs once again go three-and-out, burn timeout\n\nIt’s been a struggle for Kansas City to move the ball, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better after another three-and-out, this time inside its own 10-yard line.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to make it a close third-and-one after Travis Kelce got his second catch of the day, but the 49ers stuffed Isiah Pacheco on third down after taking its first timeout of the second half. It would’ve been quite the gamble to go for it, so Andy Reid sent out the punting unit to give the ball back to San Francisco. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n49ers unable to take advantage of Patrick Mahomes INT\n\nSan Francisco missed a gigantic opportunity to take a commanding lead after the 49ers intercepted Patrick Mahomes. That didn’t happen as San Francisco was stopped and punted. However, the 49ers were able to bury Kansas City on its own 2-yard line on that kick.\n\nBy the way, Prince was previously the best Super Bowl halftime show, but Usher’s was better. Will not be taking any questions at this time. — Mike Freeman\n\nPatrick Mahomes picked off by 49ers on opening drive of second half\n\nThe Chiefs had a chance to tie the game out of halftime.\n\nInstead, the 49ers will be getting great field position.\n\nSafety Ji'Ayir Brown picked off Patrick Mahomes on the opening drive of the third quarter, setting up San Francisco at the Kansas City 44-yard line.\n\nIt was a bad start after a poor handoff to Isiah Pacheco resulted in a fumble for a loss of 12. Two plays later, Mahomes was picked off, which was his first interception thrown in the past two postseasons. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nLAS VEGAS — Super Bowl 58 might have started unlucky because neither team scored in the first quarter and each team committed a turnover.\n\nBut when the Kansas City Chiefs scored a field goal late in the second quarter, making them trail the San Francisco 49ers 10-3, conspiracy theories surrounding Taylor Swift and her lucky No. 13 seemed all too real. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLAS VEGAS – Word spread through the 200 club level on the east side of Allegiant Stadium as kickoff for Super Bowl 58 neared. More than two-dozen people congregated along a corridor and in the area near Suite E2020, which they’d heard had an exclusive guest.\n\nTaylor Swift.\n\nThe clock ticked. No Taylor. The crowd dispersed, but those who snuck past security to get to the front side of the suite confirmed the rumors. — Josh Peter\n\nWinners and losers of Super Bowl 58 second quarter: 49ers 10, Chiefs 3\n\nWINNERS\n\nTrick play, perfectly timed\n\nCredit 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan for the timing of the double pass touchdown to Christian McCaffrey — via the arm of receiver Jauan Jennings — to compromise Kansas City’s defense. With San Francisco just outside of the red zone, Shanahan must’ve known that Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo would be particularly aggressive. When Brock Purdy threw the first pass to Jennings, almost all of Kansas City’s defense rushed to the left side of the field, leaving McCaffrey and a roster of blockers — four of them — to easily pave a lane for McCaffrey to run unimpeded into the end zone.\n\nLOSERS\n\nIsiah Pacheco\n\nThe Chiefs running back absolutely wasted a chance at getting points when the ball squirted out of his hands on a first-and-goal carry from the 9, the play immediately following Patrick Mahomes’ 52-yard strike to Mecole Hardman. The 49ers recovered, meaning both teams have given the ball away deep in opposing territory. Pacheco, otherwise, has been a nonfactor, carrying the ball seven times for 27 yards in the first half.\n\nAwful injury luck for the Niners\n\n49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw is something of a tone-setting enforcer for the San Francisco defense. He had already recorded three tackles in the game before his freak Achilles injury, when he crumpled to the turf simply trying to run on the field for the game’s next play. Greenlaw, who has been ruled out, is a massive loss for San Francisco’s defense, leaving a void of speed and physicality needed to defend against the Chiefs.\n\nKansas City (uncharacteristically) losing its composure\n\nIn the second quarter alone, the Chiefs saw star tight end Travis Kelce bump head coach Andy Reid because he was apparently upset over not being on the field when Pacheco fumbled and star cornerback L’Jarius Sneed called for an unnecessary roughness penalty. Two plays after Sneed's penalty, San Francisco scored the game’s first touchdown. The Chiefs appeared to settle — defensive tackle Chris Jones called a huddle on the sideline to have a meeting of the entire defense — but this is rather uncharted territory for the more experienced team on this stage. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 halftime score is 13! Are Taylor Swift conspiracy theories real?\n\nLAS VEGAS — Super Bowl 58 might have started unlucky because neither team scored in the first quarter and each team committed a turnover.\n\nBut when the Kansas City Chiefs scored a field goal late in the second quarter, making them trail the San Francisco 49ers 10-3, conspiracy theories surrounding Taylor Swift and her lucky No. 13 seemed all too real.\n\nThe pop superstar, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, made it to Allegiant Stadium after flying her private jet 13 hours to Los Angeles from Tokyo and then flying into Las Vegas for the game. The Super Bowl is the 13th Chiefs game she has attended this season to cheer on her man. The numbers of 5 and 8 in the Super Bowl edition, the date — Feb. 11 (2+11) — and the 49ers digits all add up to 13. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBiggest comebacks in Super Bowl history\n\n25 points — Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl 51\n\n10 points — Chiefs against 49ers in Super Bowl 54\n\n10 points — Patriots against Seahawks in Super Bowl 49\n\n10 points — Saints against Colts in Super Bowl 44\n\n10 points — Washington against Broncos in Super Bowl 22\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers halftime stats\n\n49ers passing — Brock Purdy 10-15 for 123 yards; Jauan Jennings 1-1 for 21 yards, TD\n\n49ers rushing — Christian McCaffrey 9 carries, 33 yards\n\n49ers receiving — Christian McCaffrey 5 receptions, 47 yards, TD; Deebo Samuel 2 catches, 24 yards\n\n49ers defense — Fred Warner 6 tackles, Arik Armstead 1 sack, Chase Young 1 sack\n\nChiefs passing — Patrick Mahomes 11-13 for 123 yards\n\nChiefs rushing — Isiah Pacheco 7 carries, 27 yards\n\nChiefs receiving — Mecole Hardman 1 catch, 52 yards; Justin Watson 1 catch, 21 yards\n\nChiefs defense — Nick Bolton 8 tackles, Justin Reid 0.5 sacks, George Karlaftis 0.5 sacks\n\nTravis Kelce stats at halftime\n\nChiefs star tight end Travis Kelce has just one catch for 1 yard as Super Bowl 58 rolls into halftime.\n\nKelce had shined this postseason, making 23 catches for 262 yards and three touchdowns in the Chiefs' three victories. Kelce's 157 playoff catches (including today) are a record and he's never had fewer than three in a playoff game.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis had the foresight to include this in his bold predictions. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers 10, Chiefs 3: KC finally gets on board in Super Bowl 58\n\nAfter falling down two possessions, the Chiefs were able to score just before halftime with a field goal to make it a 10-3 49ers lead.\n\nIt was the longest drive of the day for Kansas City at 12 plays, 65 yards. It was just its second red zone trip of the evening. The Chiefs were able to get to the 9-yard line on third down, but Patrick Mahomes took a big hit from Arik Armstead that resulted in a 1-yard sack. Harrison Butker, who kicked the game-winning field goal in last season’s Super Bowl, then knocked in the 28-yard field goal for Kansas City’s first points.\n\nWhile still trailing, Kansas City will have a chance to tie it up out of the break, as it will get the ball to start the second half. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl score: Beautiful trick play gives 49ers 10-0 lead\n\nThe play was slow developing and a little awkward, but it worked. It may end up being the play of the game.\n\n49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings threw a pass to Christian McCaffrey that hung in the air so long it could have been shot down by the Air Force. But it connected and McCaffrey ran in for the touchdown. It was his ninth career postseason touchdown.\n\nSo in the end, the first player to throw a touchdown pass was a wide receiver. — Mike Freeman\n\nDre Greenlaw injury\n\nA non-contact injury has put San Francisco 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw out of Super Bowl 58.\n\nAfter the 49ers punted the ball to the Kansas City Chiefs in the second quarter at Allegiant Stadium, Greenlaw was getting himself hyped to back on the field with the rest of the defense. But when he took a step toward the field, there appeared to be an issue with his left leg and he immediately went to the ground. Trainers came to his aide as he was unable to put any pressure on his leg and he made his way to the bench.\n\nGreenlaw has an Achilles injury and has been ruled out. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl field\n\nThough Allegiant Stadium is domed, the playing surface is natural grass.\n\nNFL's turf vs. grass debate rages on. Here’s what the overwhelming majority of players think\n\nAs NFL Players' Association executive director Lloyd Howell toured the 32 organizations in the league throughout the 2023 regular season, he listened to players' concerns over a wide variety of issues. For a union with a membership around 2,000 individuals, finding a consensus to address any one issue can be a problem. Howell quickly realized which one had the most unanimity: players' desires to play on grass fields instead of turf.\n\nThe topic — already relevant ahead of Super Bowl 58 as the San Francisco 49ers voiced concerns ahead of their matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs — was the primary theme of Howell's first public appearance as leader of the union since he was named to the position over the summer.\n\nA survey conducted by the NFLPA that included 1,700 respondents had a 92% response rate of players saying they preferred to play on high-quality grass rather than synthetic turf. Six percent are indifferent, according to the survey. Read Chris Bumbaca’s full story here.\n\nChiefs drive: KC goes three and out\n\nKansas City's offense continues to struggle against San Francisco's D.\n\nMahomes was called for intentional grounding on the first play and then was nearly sacked on third-and-16 but managed to scramble for a few yards. Tommy Townsend came on for his third punt of the game, and the 49ers will start at their own 33. — Casey Moore\n\n49ers can't take advantage of horse collar penalty\n\nWhile scrambling, Brock Purdy was grabbed by Kansas City linebacker Nick Bolton. It was called a horse collar tackle. It was a questionable one. But it gave San Francisco a first down. But again, the 49ers still couldn’t consistently move the ball. The game remained an unattractive slugfest of an unattractive game of slugfest proportions. — Mike Freeman\n\nTravis Kelce yelling at coach: Chiefs TE gets heated on sideline\n\nTravis Kelce was heated on the Kansas City Chiefs’ sideline following Isiah Pacheco's red zone fumble.\n\nKelce was shown on the CBS broadcast screaming at coach Andy Reid, even bumping into the 65-year-old coach. CBS analyst Tony Romo speculated that Kelce was aggressively saying he should have stayed on the field with the Chiefs on the verge of the end zone (he was not on the field when Pacheco fumbled). — Jace Evans\n\n49ers recover Chiefs fumble\n\nJust when it looked like the Chiefs could get even, they gave the ball away.\n\nOne play after Patrick Mahomes connected with Mecole Hardman on a 52-yard play down to the 49ers' 9-yard line, Kansas City running back Isiah Pacheco lost the football. Javon Hargrave recovered the fumble and gave possession back to San Francisco. — Casey Moore\n\nLongest field goal in Super Bowl history: Jake Moody gives 49ers lead\n\nThe game has been mostly a punter’s dream but again Brock Purdy, showing calmness and accuracy, connected on several crucial long passes, moving the 49ers into Kansas City territory.\n\nKey part of this game has been mostly San Francisco’s ability to protect Purdy.\n\nThe 49ers’ drive ended with Jake Moody's Super Bowl record 55-yard field goal. Suddenly, punters everywhere wept. — Mike Freeman\n\nWho is Jake Moody? Meet 49ers' record-breaking kicker\n\nJake Moody, 24, is a rookie who was drafted with the 99th overall selection in the third round of the 2023 NFL draft. Here's what else you need to know about him.\n\nWinners and losers of Super Bowl 58 first quarter: Chiefs 0, 49ers 0\n\nWinners\n\n49ers dominating the lines of scrimmage\n\nSan Francisco completely controlled the first quarter, outgaining the Chiefs, 125-16. It all happened upfront, on both the offensive and defensive lines. Brock Purdy had ample time to drop back and survey the field, running through his progressions with ease. On defense, the 49ers generated enough pressure to fold Mahomes back into the pocket and quicken his timing. The Chiefs ran only seven offensive plays in the first frame and their opening possession was a three-and-out. The problem for the 49ers: because of Christian McCaffrey’s fumble and Trent Williams’ penalties, they haven’t take advantage — at least not yet.\n\nKansas City's decision to defer\n\nBrock Purdy and the 49ers, thanks mainly to Christian McCaffrey’s four touches on the first five plays of the game, were charging down the field, gaining 48 yards. McCaffrey’s fumble, however, cut the first drive of the game short and gave Kansas City a chance to take an early lead. San Francisco’s defense held and Kansas City posted a three-and-out, but the decision to defer can still pay dividends if the Chiefs manage the clock in the second quarter to be the last team to score, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nMitch Wishnowsky and Tommy Townsend\n\nIt’s typically not a great sign if both punters are on this side of the list, but San Francisco’s Mitch Wishnowsky had a field-reversing, 54-yard punt after penalties stalled the second Niners’ drive. Then, on the following series, Chiefs punter Tommy Townsend flipped the field and answered with his 62-yard bomb. Both punts buried the opposing offenses deep in their own 20.\n\nLosers\n\nChristian McCaffrey and Trent Williams\n\nWithout question, these two are among San Francisco’s best players. McCaffrey is fresh off of his AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Williams just posted his third consecutive first team All-Pro season. Both of them cost the 49ers in the first quarter. McCaffrey’s fumble robbed San Francisco’s chance to seize momentum and two Williams penalties on the second series stalled the drive. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhen was Christian McCaffrey drafted\n\nMcCaffrey was selected by the Carolina Panthers with the No. 8 overall pick out of Stanford in the 2017 NFL draft. He was the second running back taken in the first round, behind Leonard Fournette, who was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the No. 4 pick. — Casey Moore\n\nWhere did George Kittle go to college\n\nKittle went to Iowa, where he only caught six passes for 134 yards his first two seasons before notching 42 receptions for 604 yards and 10 touchdowns during his final two years. He was drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL draft. — Casey Moore\n\nWhere did Deebo Samuel go to college\n\nSamuel attended South Carolina, where he put together two seasons with more than 750 receiving yards, including his senior year when he caught 62 passes for 882 yards and 11 touchdowns. He was drafted by the 49ers in the second round of the 2019 NFL draft. — Casey Moore\n\nTaylor Swift, celebrities at Super Bowl 2024\n\nIn addition to Taylor Swift, celebrities at the Super Bowl include: Paul Rudd, Queen Latifah, Jay Z, Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, Eric Stonestreet, Jimmy Kimmel, Carrot Top, Wayne Newton and the Blue Man Group.\n\nHow much do concessions cost at Super Bowl 2024?\n\nConcession prices were slightly higher than at Super Bowl 55 in Los Angeles with a soda costing between $6.99 and $8.99 at Allegiant versus $7 at SoFi Stadium.\n\nOne of the specialty foods available at Super Bowl 58 is a $37.99 order of beef ribs from local family chain Rollin Smoke Barbeque. There's also tacos and the usual popcorn, pretzels and beer.\n\nHere's the full concession rundown on the concession situation, from Victoria Hernandez on the scene in Las Vegas\n\n49ers force Chiefs to punt again\n\nKansas City was able to get a first down, but didn't get much more after that, punting the ball back to the 49ers for the second time in as many drives.\n\nAfter Isiah Pachecho picked up 10 yards for a first down on the first play of the second drive, Chase Young was able to get to Patrick Mahomes for a 4-yard sack. Mahomes found Rashee Rice on the next play, but for no gain. The pressure got close to Mahomes on third down, and he was forced to scramble for a minimum gain.\n\nSo far, Kansas City has 16 yards on seven plays. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCrucial penalties doom 49ers' second drive\n\nPerhaps still being impacted by Reba McEntire’s low energy anthem performance, the 49ers continued to struggle on offense. This time penalties forced the offense into long yardage situations and Kansas City’s defense was all too happy to take advantage and stop San Francisco. — Mike Freeman\n\nChiefs offense goes three-and-out on first drive\n\nKansas City was able to force a major turnover in its own territory, but it wasn't able to do anything with it as it punted the ball back to the 49ers after failing to get a first down in three plays.\n\nThe Chiefs got the ball on their own 27-yard line after recovering a Christian McCaffrey fumble, but a 3-yard loss by Isiah Pacheco on the first play set the Chiefs back quickly. Travis Kelce got his first catch on the next play for only 1 yard, and on third down Jerick McKinnon wasn’t able to reach the first down line on a catch.\n\nThe punt ended the Chiefs' eight-game streak of scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nCBS scorebug\n\nYour eyes aren't deceiving you, it is (a little) different!\n\nChristian McCaffrey fumbles, halts 49ers' opening drive\n\nThe initial drive of the San Francisco 49ers started off smoothly. If quarterback Brock Purdy was nervous it didn’t show as coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up easy passes and handoffs to running back Christian McCaffrey. Then disaster struck as McCaffrey fumbled and Kansas City recovered. It was just the third fumble lost by McCaffrey all year, and first since the 49ers' Week 7 loss against the Minnesota Vikings, a span of 12 games. — Mike Freeman and Casey Moore\n\nWho won the coin toss?\n\nAs the visiting team, the 49ers got to make the call on the coin toss, which was tails.

Vinovich was the alternate for Super Bowl 56. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nWho is Bill Vinovich?\n\nBill Vinovich, 62, is a third-generation referee who worked his way up to officiating college football in the Mountain West Conference. He started as a side judge for the NFL in 2001 and was promoted to an official prior to the 2004 season. For health reasons, Vinovich stopped refereeing on the field from 2007-2011 and served as a replay official. He returned to the field following successful heart surgery in 2012 on a substitute basis. Vinovich is also a certified public accountant and officiates Division I college basketball games. In his youth, Vinovich was a three-sport star at Canyon High School in Anaheim, California. He played wide receiver for two years at Santa Ana College and two years at the University of San Diego, where he graduated magna cum laude. Vinovich was also the referee in the controversial 2018 NFC championship game.

Characters from \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" will join the telecast live, with an animated SpongeBob, voiced by Tom Kenny, and Patrick Star, voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, joining CBS Sports analyst Nate Burleson and play-by-play announcer Noah Eagle live in the booth to call the game. Sandy Cheeks, voiced by Carolyn Lawrence, will serve as the sideline reporter while Larry the Lobster, voiced by Mr. Lawrence, will provide live commentary. — Gabe Hauari\n\nWho is Harrison Butker? Meet the Chiefs kicker\n\nHarrison Butker may be called upon to hit the biggest kick of his career if Super Bowl 58 against the San Francisco 49ers is close in the fourth quarter.\n\nButker has been outstanding since joining the team in 2017. He led the league in scoring in 2019 and has made 89% of his career field goals, which is second in NFL history to Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker.\n\nAnd Butker has range. The kicker hit a 70-yard field goal while warming up for Super Bowl 58, according to reporters on the scene.\n\nCountdown to Super Bowl 58: pregame scene\n\nA look at the sights in Allegiant Stadium ahead of Super Bowl 58 between the Chiefs and 49ers.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 58 being played?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will play at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the first time the venue has ever hosted a Super Bowl. The stadium is the home venue of the Las Vegas Raiders, who moved to the city in 2020. In fact, this will mark the first time in NFL history that a Super Bowl will be played in the state of Nevada. Las Vegas becomes the 19th different host city and Allegiant Stadium becomes the 27th different venue to host a Super Bowl. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 jersey colors\n\nGet the uniforms ready: we know what the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will wear in Super Bowl 58. Kansas City will serve as the \"home\" team in the matchup at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, meaning it got to choose first what uniforms it wants to wear. The decision has been made, and the Chiefs will wear their home red uniform for the game. Meanwhile, the 49ers will don their traditional road white uniform. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nSuper Bowl 58 predictions\n\nHere are our NFL expert picks based on the early odds for Super Bowl 58:\n\nJarrett Bell: Chiefs 27, 49ers 24\n\nChiefs 27, 49ers 24 Chris Bumbaca: Chiefs 30, 49ers 25\n\nChiefs 30, 49ers 25 Nate Davis: Chiefs 23, 49ers 20\n\nChiefs 23, 49ers 20 Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz: Chiefs 21, 49ers 16\n\nChiefs 21, 49ers 16 Lorenzo Reyes: 49ers 24, Chiefs 19\n\n49ers 24, Chiefs 19 Tyler Dragon: Chiefs 23, 49ers 20\n\nChiefs 23, 49ers 20 Safid Deen: Chiefs 30, 49ers 26\n\nChiefs 30, 49ers 26 Victoria Hernandez: Chiefs 28, 49ers 24\n\nChiefs 28, 49ers 24 Jordan Mendoza: Chiefs 20, 49ers 17\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers moneyline\n\nThe most basic of all bets is called the moneyline. It's simply, which team will win the game? There's a different payout for betting on each team, with the return for a wager on the favorite totaling less than the same wager on the underdog. In Super Bowl 58, the 49ers are the favorite at -130 odds. The Chiefs are the underdog at +110. Betting the moneyline:\n\nThe negative odds (-130) mean that a person would have to wager $130 on the Niners in order to win $100.\n\nThe positive odds (+110) mean that a person who successfully wagers $100 on the Chiefs would win $110. — Steve Gardner\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers point spread\n\nIn Super Bowl 58, the 49ers are a 2-point favorite over the Chiefs. To win a bet on the 49ers against the spread, they have to win by three or more points. To win a bet on the Chiefs against the spread, they need to win the game outright or lose by one or two points. The point spread is the number of points one team is favored over the other.\n\nWhen bettors wager against the spread, the final score of the game matters more than which team won. The favored team needs to win by more than the point spread in order to \"cover\" and win the bet. The underdog can still lose the game if it does so by less than the point spread for its bettors to win. — Steve Gardner\n\nSuper Bowl 58 logo\n\nSince Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the NFL's updated its graphics for the title game each season. It's even inspired a conspiracy theory about the matchup for the championship game. It's not the first change from the past 58 years, though, just the most recent. Here's a look at the history of Super Bowl logos. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nLVIII number\n\nWhat is Super Bowl LVIII? Want to learn how to read Roman numerals and why the NFL uses them? Here’s your guide.\n\nWho won Super Bowl 57?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57, the team’s second title in four seasons. A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nPatrick Mahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns. Kansas City scored a touchdown on its first three drives of the second half after trailing at halftime 24-14. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was 27 of 37 for 304 yards passing, but was also a force on the ground. He rushed for three touchdowns (15 carries, 70 yards) and tied the game at 35 on a two-point conversion with about five minutes left. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (six catches, 81 yards, touchdown) bested his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce, on the game’s biggest stage, while Chiefs coach Andy Reid defeated his former team.\n\nHere’s the complete recap of Super Bowl 57.\n\nSuper Bowl 58 squares: How to play, best (and worst) squares for the big game\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday doesn't have to only be a fun experience for football and commercial lovers. It's also an opportunity to turn the casual fan into a competitive one, and there might not be a better game for your party than Super Bowl squares. You don't have to know anything about the game of football to play squares, which levels the playing field for a room mixed with diehards and nonfans. And there are a variety of ways to play that gets everyone involved. New to the game? USA TODAY Sports has you covered with everything you need to know to play Super Bowl squares, including which squares are most likely to win.\n\nTaylor Swift's plane has landed in Las Vegas, NFL Network reports\n\nOne of the most important pregame questions for Super Bowl 58 has apparently been answered. \"Taylor Swift is in Las Vegas,\" NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said from the field at Allegiant Stadium. The pop superstar's trans-Pacific flight following her Saturday night concert in Tokyo landed in Los Angeles earlier today, and Rapoport said the connecting flight to Vegas just recently touched down.\n\n\"I'll never report bigger news today,\" Rapoport quipped.All that's left is for Swift to find her way to Allegiant Stadium, where she'll take her familiar spot in a luxury box to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Chiefs. - Steve Gardner\n\nTravis Kelce vs 49ers\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce has faced the 49ers three times in his career, Kansas City holding a 2-1 edge. In those matchups, Kelce has caught 16 passes on 21 targets for 227 yards and a touchdown. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nBrock Purdy vs Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe two Super Bowl quarterbacks have faced off once before in the NFL — kind of. When the Chiefs and 49ers played in October 2022, a contest Kansas City won 44-23, Jimmy Garoppolo was under center for San Francisco. After Garoppolo was yanked late in the fourth quarter, Purdy got some garbage time reps, completing 4 of 9 passes for 66 yards and an interception. Mahomes, meanwhile, went 23-of-34 for 423 yards, three TDs and a pick. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nHow much money can Chiefs and 49ers players earn if they win Super Bowl 58?\n\nFor players on the Super Bowl 58 winning team, $164,000 of prize money can be earned. Players on the losing team will get $89,000 in prize money. Both totals represent a $7,000 increase from the per-player payouts from Super Bowl 57. Teams also earn prize money as they advance through the playoffs. As a division winner that also played on wild-card weekend, the Chiefs can earn the maximum $338,000 if they win the Super Bowl. The 49ers, meanwhile, who didn't play on wild-card weekend due to being the NFC's No. 1 playoff seed, can earn a maximum of $333,000 if they win on Super Sunday. — Jim Reineking\n\nWho is the highest-paid player in Super Bowl 58?\n\nThat title of the highest-paid player in Super Bowl 58 belongs to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In September, Mahomes agreed to a restructured contract with the Chiefs that will pay him $210.6 million guaranteed between 2023 and 2026, the most ever for an NFL player in a four-year span, according to ESPN. Mahomes is under contract until 2031, but he and the Chiefs will revisit his contract after the 2026 season. — Cydney Henderson\n\nHighest-paid players in Super Bowl 58\n\nHere are the highest-paid players in Super Bowl 58 based on average annual value, according to Over The Cap. — Cydney Henderson\n\nThe 58 greatest players in Super Bowl history: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut\n\nCrafting a list of the greatest players in Super Bowl history is a near-impossible endeavor. Do you favor the biggest stars? Those who shone brightest on Super Sunday? The ones with sustained levels of excellence? Nate Davis weighed each consideration, attempting to also make it representative of all positions rather than skew too heavily toward quarterbacks or offensive players who more easily show up in the box score (and MVP log). So, here's his list of the 58 greatest players in Super Bowl history as we head into Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWhat is the capacity of Allegiant Stadium?\n\nFor regular-season Raiders games, capacity of Allegiant Stadium is 65,000, though many venues that host Super Bowls typically can add seating for a game of that magnitude. That makes Allegiant Stadium the fourth-smallest stadium in the NFL with Ford Field (65,000), State Farm Stadium (63,400) and Solider Field (61,500). — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nSuper Bowl 58 stadium: Where exactly is Allegiant Stadium?\n\nAllegiant Stadium is just west of the southern edge of Las Vegas Boulevard, more famously known as the Las Vegas Strip. That makes Allegiant Stadium quite accessible for guests staying at some of Las Vegas’ more popular hotels and resorts on the Strip. For ease of transportation, the stadium is also very close to Harry Reid International Airport, the city’s main hub, about a 15-minute drive away. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n'Game manager' means double standard for Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes\n\nFor the San Francisco 49ers, \"game manager\" might be the two most vexing words of Super Bowl week. But it’s a label that’s been attached to quarterback Brock Purdy with what seems like a certain level of disparagement. Conversely, Kansas City Chiefs counterpart and two-time league MVP Patrick Mahomes has been praised lately for his prowess as, yup, a \"game manager.\"\n\nSo what gives? Why the shade aimed at a guy – meaning Purdy – who was an MVP finalist for the 2023 season, compounded by a double standard?\n\n\"I don’t have the strongest arm in the world, or I may not be making crazy, flashy plays like other guys around the league,\" said Purdy. \"At the end of the day, if we’re looking at the main goal, it’s about winning – and, so, I feel like I can do that well.\" - Nate Davis\n\nThe 58 greatest NFL teams to play in the Super Bowl – and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nThe 2023 Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will become the 115th and 116th Super Bowl participants on Sunday, when they cross paths at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Through the years, there have been several dominant squads, some which caught lightning in a bottle at just the right time and others seemingly poised for greatness that ultimately fell just short in the NFL's biggest game. Here are what Nate Davis believes to be the 58 greatest teams to play on Super Bowl Sunday – and not all of them won.\n\nRun it back. Super Bowl 58 will mark the ninth “rematch” between franchises that have previously collided on Super Sunday (the Cowboys and Steelers the only clubs to meet three times). It was only four years ago that the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers battled in South Florida, K.C. ending a 50-year Super Bowl drought by prevailing 31-20 in a game that was far closer and dramatic than the final score indicates. As Super Bowl 58, which will be the first ever staged in Las Vegas, approaches, here are Nate Davis’ all-time Super Sunday game rankings.\n\nSuper Bowl 58 bold predictions for Chiefs vs. 49ers\n\nWhat predictions are there left to make for Super Bowl 58?\n\nAfter two weeks of anticipation and preparation, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers have been closely inspected and analyzed from an array of angles. Picks have been made for Sunday's big event in Las Vegas. Prop bets have been outlined.\n\nBut with kickoff drawing near, we couldn't help but take one last crack at forecasting what might be ahead at Allegiant Stadium to close out the 2023 NFL season. With that in mind, we asked USA TODAY Sports' NFL reporters and columnists for one bold prediction for Super Bowl 58. Here are the results.\n\n49ers’ Super Bowl appearances\n\nSuper Bowl 58 will be San Francisco's eighth Super Bowl. The other seven are: Super Bowl 16, Super Bowl 19, Super Bowl 23, Super Bowl 24, Super Bowl 29, Super Bowl 47 and Super Bowl 54. San Francisco has won five Super Bowl championships. After winning in the big game their first five trips, the 49ers have lost the last two times they've been to the Super Bowl. San Francisco last hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after the 1994 season in Super Bowl 29 against the then-San Diego Chargers. Here’s everything to know about the 49ers’ Super Bowl history. — Tyler Dragon\n\nHow many Super Bowls have the Chiefs won?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are playing in their sixth Super Bowl and making their fourth appearance in the past five years. Kansas City has won eight consecutive AFC West crowns, the second-longest streak of division championships for any NFL team since 1970. The Chiefs are also vying for their fourth Super Bowl title. The New York Giants (4), Green Bay Packers (4), Dallas Cowboys (5), San Francisco 49ers (5), Pittsburgh Steelers (6) and New England Patriots (6) are the only teams with four or more Super Bowl wins. Here's everything to know about the Chiefs' Super Bowl history. — Tyler Dragon\n\nHow much are Super Bowl tickets?\n\nIt's the most expensive Super Bowl on record, according to TickPick, with average ticket prices around $9,384 on the secondary market. For reference, Super Bowl 57's average ticket price was $5,795, TickPick said. Even if you want to pay the minimum for a Super Bowl ticket on a secondary market, it will still cost close to five figures.\n\nThe cheapest ticket to the game can be found on StubHub for $5,542, $7,481 with fees, as of Thursday afternoon. The cheapest tickets for Allegiant Stadium will be further away from the action, like the 300 sections on the endzone sides and the corners of the 400 level. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nEven for Las Vegas, Super Bowl 58 is a huge deal\n\nThousands of fans descended upon the bottom of The Strip the day before \"the Big Game.\" Said 10-year Vegas resident Dominick Lynch, a host at Wahlburgers in \"The Shoppes at Mandalay Bay\" mall: \"I’ve never really seen it this busy. We’ve always had a rush-in with the conventions and stuff, but it’s never been quite like this. You can just feel it walking around. It’s great.\" Read Chris Bumbaca's story here.\n\nBody piercer finds jewelry connected to 'Nipplegate' Super Bowl scandal\n\nByriah Dailey, a body piercer from Houston, said he was cleaning in his garage recently when he rediscovered a piece of Super Bowl history. It was the coordinating nipple shield that matches the one worn by Janet Jackson during the halftime show at the 2004 Super Bowl, Dailey said. Since that infamous moment, he has been credited with selling the piece of jewelry to Jackson’s former fashion stylist, Wayne Scot Lukas, days before the game. “It was a little tarnished because it’s been sitting in a drawer for awhile,\" Dailey, 53, told USA TODAY Sports. Read Josh Peter's story here.\n\nChiefs vs. 49ers Super Bowl 2019\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid all won their first Super Bowl four years ago, a 31-20 victory over Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. Jimmy Garoppolo started at quarterback for San Francisco, completing 20 of 31 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown and two picks. Mahomes was 26-of-42 passing for 286 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nHere’s the complete list of Super Bowl scores, MVPs and locations for all 57 previous games. — Jim Reineking\n\nChiefs vs 49ers past games\n\nThe Chiefs and 49ers have played each other 14 times, each side winning seven of those contests. All but one of those matchups were in the regular season. The lone playoff matchup was in Super Bowl 54, which Kansas City won. The sides most recently played in 2022, Kansas City winning 44-23. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nWhat happened to Kadarius Toney?\n\nKansas City Chiefs wide receiver Kadarius Toney is not expected to play in Super Bowl 58, according to an ESPN report. The controversial wide receiver, who caught a touchdown pass and had a key 65-yard punt return in the Chiefs' Super Bowl win last year, hasn't been active since Week 15 of the regular season. Toney made headlines when he denied being injured and blasted the Chiefs on social media before the AFC championship game. When asked about Toney's status for Super Bowl Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers earlier in the week, Chiefs coach Andy Reid would only say, \"We'll see how it goes.\" — Steve Gardner\n\nNational anthem length betting lines\n\nThis year, the betting line ranges from 86 to 90.5 seconds. The “over” is favored for good reason considering the average anthem performance is one minute and 5 seconds. — Melissa Ruggieri\n\nUsher’s biggest hits: What songs will he perform at the Super Bowl?\n\nIf you made an Usher playlist using only his biggest hits it would last an hour and 42 minutes, according to the one we built on Apple Music. The Super Bowl halftime show is slotted for 12-15 minutes. Prepare for many medleys. There are many Usher songs we hope to hear, even if they’re a medley. Here they are, presented by era. — Melissa Ruggieri\n\nHow long is the Super Bowl Halftime Show?\n\nA regular NFL halftime normally lasts 13 minutes, but halftime for the Super Bowl lasts longer to accommodate for the setup, show and takedown, in addition to teams' on-field warm-ups. Still, expect Usher to be on the stage for fewer than 15 minutes. \"Don’t take the moments for granted because you only get 13 of them,\" Usher said of the halftime show in November. \"The hardest part is trying to figure out how to squeeze it all in when you actually have a large catalog, or a lot of records people celebrate and love.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nWhen is Super Bowl halftime show? Here's when you should expect to tune in to watch Usher\n\nUsher's halftime show performance will take place during, well, halftime, but when exactly is that? Halftime is a brief intermission between the first and second halves of the Super Bowl. Each half of the game is made up of two 15-minute quarters, but the game clock differs from the actual length of the game. Stoppages in play, from timeouts to TV timeouts and commercials during the game, make it hard to predict the exact time halftime begins, but on average, each quarter typically lasts about 45 minutes. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. — Cydney Henderson\n\nWill Taylor Swift be at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough it has yet to be confirmed whether Taylor Swift will be at the Super Bowl, it seems unlikely she would miss the biggest game of the season. Swift has been to 12 Chiefs games this season, including each of Kansas City's playoff games. Swift's concert in Tokyo — which is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas — is set for 6 p.m. local time Saturday, with her concerts typically lasting more than 3 hours, 15 minutes. According to NPR, Swift's show at the Tokyo Dome is located roughly 30 minutes from Haneda and an hour from Narita, Tokyo's main two airports. Kevin O'Leary, the president and CEO of Jet Advisors, told NPR that Swift could be in the air around 11:30 p.m. in Japan, or 6:30 a.m. Las Vegas time, after meeting some \"logistics and clearances\" before liftoff. — Austin Curtright\n\n——\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Amid all the celebrating and champagne and cameras, the message easily could have gone unnoticed, or faded from memory, if not so perfect.\n\nBEST EVER.\n\nAn equipment man had written that in honor of the 1973 Miami Dolphins, who had just won their second consecutive Super Bowl. And although a wide smile managed to pierce the stern jaw of Don Shula when he saw it while walking out to pick up the trophy, years would pass before anyone, Shula included, could fully appreciate them.\n\nBEST EVER. That’s Donald Francis Shula, who died Monday at age 90.\n\nShula was the greatest coach in the 100-year history of the National Football League as measured by his record 347 victories, that beacon of a bottom line he so treasured.\n\nAll things Dolphins: Latest Miami Dolphins news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nHow strange that this morning, his legacy shines even brighter through the prism of the greatest loss that could ever be associated with him — the loss of the man himself.\n\nGone is an icon, a man who could stand alongside Henry Flagler for the sculpting of a Mount Rushmore for Florida. It’s not simply because he won some football games, or even all of them in that glorious 17-0 season of 1972.\n\nIt’s the manner in which he did so: stressing a work ethic, respect and integrity in a way that grabbed Larry Csonka and Dan Marino by the collar just as surely as it did the brick layer in Hialeah and the landscaper in Lantana.\n\nDon Shula made us feel better about calling ourselves South Floridians.\n\nShula arrived on Feb. 18, 1970, a reasonably successful 40-year-old coach joining a laughably unsuccessful 4-year-old expansion franchise nestled in the “Sun and Fun Capital of the World.”\n\nLongtime South Floridians tell stories of an evening less than three years later, Jan. 14, 1973. Thousands of fans of all colors and all languages clogged Miami’s streets following the Dolphins’ 14-7 Super Bowl victory over Washington to complete The Perfect Season, capital letters required. This was an era in which all self-respecting Dolfans brought white handkerchiefs to the Orange Bowl to form a shimmering, white-capped sea after every score. Now, after a championship? They stepped onto balconies and waved white bedsheets.\n\nMiami was wrestling with the melting pot it was fast becoming, but on this night, with Shula at the wheel, the only colors that mattered were aqua and orange.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nSouth Florida grew up under Don Shula’s watch. Similar championship celebrations have followed for upstart franchises called the Heat and Marlins and nearly the Panthers, but none came wrapped in the knowledge that history — lasting history — was unfolding as surely as those bedsheets were. The Dolphins had the best football team of that year and any year, according to Shula, forever puzzled there was even a debate.\n\n“How can anyone be better than perfect?” he reminded us.\n\n“The greatest coach ever,” is what the greatest Dolphin ever, Dan Marino, called Shula the day Marino’s bust joined Shula’s in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThen and always, respect tailed Shula like a shadow. In 1957, then a defensive back, Shula was presented a ball from the Colts for a game in which he did not play. He had been waived days earlier, yet the Colts could not let him walk away empty handed.\n\nHe was promptly offered an assistant’s job at the University of Virginia, the only issue being finding his new workplace since he’d never even visited for an interview. He had no coaching experience. Yet just like that, there went his original inclination — joining the priesthood.\n\nWhich is not to suggest Shula was squeaky clean. His record shows one unpardonable blemish over his 90 years, and it’s one football fans can be most thankful for.\n\n“No more football,” Don’s mother, Mary, said the day her son, then about 13, came home with a nose sliced open from making a tackle.\n\nThat might well have been the end of this story. In this Hungarian household where Dad made $15 a week as a foreman in a nursery, the only things feared almost as much as God were Mom and Dad. The standing rule was as soon as the street lights came on, the kids had to be home. Once, during a power failure, Don pressed his luck. Once.\n\nBut Don wasn’t about to give up on football that easily, so the next season, he forged his parents’ signature on the permission card.\n\n“I loved the game too much to give it up,” he wrote in his 1974 autobiography, “The Winning Edge.”\n\nThe tough taskmaster\n\nSafe to say that at one time or another, most Dolphins wished Shula had quit then and there. Legendary at “Camp Shula” were four-a-day practices and 12-minute runs in the blistering summer sun. Even after the sun packed up for the day, the Dolphins would not.\n\n“A couple of times we had the cars in the parking lot shine their lights out on the field so we could see,” Shula said.\n\nFormer Colt Norm Bulaich, a Dolphins fullback from 1975-79, had two messages for Shula when he retired: “I wished I’d been coached all 10 years by him. But then my second statement was I probably wouldn’t have made it 10 years.”\n\nMiami sportswriters quickly learned that second-guessing Shula after games was done at the inquisitor’s risk. Why, even Shula’s “boss” watched his step. Dolphins owner Joe Robbie once made the mistake of yelling at Shula in front of dozens at the team’s annual awards banquet.\n\n“If you ever shout at me again, I’ll knock you on your ass,” Shula said.\n\nIt wasn’t as if Shula hadn’t warned everybody. “I’m as subtle as a punch in the face,” Shula had said during his introductory 1970 news conference at The Jockey Club in Miami.\n\nShula absorbed some jabs, but not many. The granddaddy: One day in the ’70s, a few Dolphins stuffed a small alligator in his shower.\n\n“A fun thing at the time,” Shula practically howled during a 2005 reunion of retired Dolphins. “I was riding them pretty tough and they wanted to show me I was a little uptight. I said, ‘That’s pretty serious, putting a live alligator in the shower.’ ”\n\nNot as serious as some conspirators wished.\n\n“I heard a scream like no one’s heard before,” running back Jim Kiick said. “I was in the doghouse. He thought I was the instigator for the whole thing. He approached me screaming and yelling. I said, ‘Coach Shula, my only involvement was taking a vote whether we should tape his mouth shut. I voted against. Fortunately for you, I lost.’ ”\n\nIn the ’70s, it was Kiick and Csonka riding horseback up Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, playing up their “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” national personas. In the ’80s, The Marks Brothers kept things lively for Shula, especially the time receiver Mark Clayton referred to him as “the fat man” in a newspaper interview.\n\n“WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FAT?” Shula said.\n\nAs uncomfortable perches go, the chair in front of Don Shula’s desk produced sweaty palms by the bucketload. Clayton eventually caught on there was just one escape route from that hotseat: “You’re right, coach.”\n\nNothing mellow about him\n\nMost of the time, Shula was right and knew it. Most of the time. Not long after moving to Florida, he and wife Dorothy went to the hot spot at the time, a jai-alai fronton, to absorb some South Florida culture.\n\n“Chula! Chula!” came the chants. Shula stood and waved.\n\n“No, Don, there weren’t cheering for you,” Dorothy said, pulling his arm down. It’s a jai-alai term for an outstanding shot.\n\nEven the supposedly mellower Don Shula had his feisty moments. With Marino about to enter the Hall of Fame in 2005, Shula was asked how much the quarterback benefited from having only two head coaches in the NFL. Marino’s other coach was Jimmy Johnson, who had a frosty relationship with Shula and Marino.\n\n“You mean he had one coach,” Shula said. “Look at the numbers. They speak for themselves.”\n\nNo other Dolphins coach has come close to measuring up to Shula. Ever protective of the franchise, Shula, as vice chairman of the club, was particularly critical in January 2007, when Nick Saban told “blatant lies,” Shula said, before abruptly quitting for the Alabama job.\n\n“That’s the thing I don’t respect about his whole time here,” Shula said. “He came here to do a job and after two years, and 15-17, he didn’t get it done. Making the decision to leave probably had a lot to do with the fact that he didn’t have the belief he would get it done.”\n\nAlways, Shula meant what he said and said what he meant. Would you buy a used car from Don Shula? Folks did in his hometown of Painesville, Ohio. That’s how Shula supplemented his income during two off-seasons as a young defensive back for the Baltimore Colts. In Don we trusted: In the ’80s, a steakhouse that put Shula’s name on it saw profits soar by $3 million the first year. Now, there are Shula’s Steak Houses throughout the country. But only South Florida also boasts the Shula name on a highway, a hotel, a golf course and a charitable foundation.\n\n“If Shula declared tomorrow as Christmas, most South Floridians would have their stocking up by sunlight,” legendary Miami Herald columnist Edwin Pope wrote in September 1980, 11 years after his suggestion to Robbie that he hire Shula changed NFL history. Robbie then took it to another Herald staffer, reporter Bill Braucher, a classmate of Shula’s at John Carroll University who acted as the go-between.\n\nBeloved coach\n\nShula spent 26 years with the Dolphins, unlikely to be matched in today’s NFL, and commanded fatherly respect of his players long after they were his players.\n\n“I miss you guys,” Shula told Clayton and Mark Duper during a conference call from his North Carolina vacation home in 2003. “They made going to work exciting.”\n\nThe occasion was The Marks Brothers joining the Dolphins Honor Roll at the stadium, which Shula had been named to in 1996. Shula’s highest honor came a year later when sons David and Mike presented him for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n“Larry Csonka said it best for all of us,” David and Mike said in unison that day. “Some days we love to love him. Some days we love to hate him, but we always, always love him.″\n\nShula was a family man to the end, his face glistening at the mere mention of more than a dozen grandchildren. Yet Shula suffered his greatest loss in 1991, when his first wife, Dorothy, died of breast cancer. Dorothy was Don’s rock during 32 years of marriage. Clearly, theirs was a match made to be, for she accepted his proposal even though it arrived in a letter.\n\n“Now that I look back, it does seem sort of strange,” Don wrote in his 1974 book.\n\nAfter kicker Garo Yepremian attempted that all-time-blooper of a pass that the Redskins returned for a touchdown in the 1973 Super Bowl, he received a heartfelt letter saying he was forgiven. It took awhile before either Garo or Don figured out it was Dorothy who wrote it, on Don’s behalf.\n\nFollowing Dorothy’s death, he began the Don Shula Foundation for breast cancer research. He remarried, to the former Mary Anne Stephens. On the field, he became the NFL’s all-time winningest coach. And he mellowed. Seeing former guard Bob Kuechenberg at a dinner, Shula hugged him and told him he loved him.\n\n“When he walked away, I said to my wife, ‘Did you just hear what I think I heard?’ ” Kuechenberg told Sports Illustrated in 1993, when Shula was named the magazine’s sportsman of the year. “It’s something he never would have said in the old days. The Lombardi in him wouldn’t have let him. Now he can say something like that. He isn’t afraid to show that kind of emotion.”\n\nNot even having to use a motorized wheelchair could dampen his spirit. At the Dolphins’ 50th anniversary gala in Hollywood in December 2015, Shula was overjoyed seeing all the familiar faces, each bringing back “great” memories. In those faces, and in every hand he made sure he shook, the message was the same: Thank you, Coach. Thank you.\n\nStern but fair\n\nShula’s players knew as stern as the man could be, he still was fair.\n\n“The thing about Don was you could get right back in his face and argue with him,” defensive tackle Manny Fernandez said.\n\nLarry Seiple, a punter on the ’72 team who later served as a Shula assistant coach, had a heated argument with Shula on the field one morning. During lunch, Seiple apologized.\n\n“I don’t even know what you’re talking about,” Shula said, already focused on the day’s next task.\n\nMarino, Kuechenberg and Csonka ranked among Shula’s favorites — he even named his dog “Zonk” — but having been an average player himself, Shula appreciated hard work by all. Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson was a backup in 1993 when a series of injuries to others made him the quarterback of record on Nov. 14, 1993, the day Shula won his 325th game against the Eagles to surpass Chicago’s George Halas as the winningest coach.\n\nEight years later, Shula saw Pederson on a golf course. Shula didn’t mention the Eagles game specifically but didn’t have to. “He made it known to me he was very appreciative,” said Pederson, who went on to coach a Super Bowl winner himself, in 2017-18.\n\nSo Shula won with Doug Pederson. In Baltimore, Shula won with running back Tom Matte filling in at quarterback, calling plays off a wristband that ended up in the Hall of Fame. Shula went to Super Bowls with brainy Bob Griese utilizing three outstanding running backs, with Marino throwing 48 touchdown passes in 1984, and with David Woodley and Don Strock morphed into “Woodstrock” in 1982. Before the 1972 season, Shula signed veteran Earl Morrall as a pricey insurance policy in case Griese got hurt. Then, Griese got hurt. Shula achieved perfection anyway, thanks to Morrall.\n\nThroughout all these styles, two constants:\n\nDon Shula.\n\nWinning.\n\n“He can take his’n and beat your’n,” former Houston Oilers coach Bum Phillips famously said. “Then he can take your’n and beat his’n.”\n\nAlways out-thinking opposition\n\nSome of the most talked-about plays of Shula’s era came down to out-thinking opponents: the hook-and-lateral for a touchdown in the classic playoff loss to the Chargers ... the “clock play” in which Marino faked a spike and threw a winning touchdown pass against the Jets ... the intentional safety that preserved a victory against the Steelers and even humbled Howard Cosell (“Shula’s ahead of us all,” Cosell admitted on air).\n\nShula presided over two of the most-storied overtime playoff games ever, the 41-38 loss to the Chargers in 1982 and the 27-24 victory over the Chiefs on Christmas Day 1971, the longest game in NFL history at 82 minutes, 40 seconds.\n\n“That was probably one of the great memories of my coaching career,” Shula said of the raucous late-night airport reception, a first in Miami, after the Chiefs game.\n\n(Not so great was what followed, when Don and David Shula got to their car, discovered a dead battery and hitchhiked home, asking their stunned Samaritans to enter the Shula home for a Christmas toast.)\n\nIn 1983, Shula spent a first-round draft choice on Marino after 26 others would not. In chronological order, he mined Jake Scott in the seventh round, Vern Den Herder in the ninth, Doug Betters in the sixth, Hall of Famer Dwight Stephenson in the second, Clayton in the eighth and Bryan Cox in the fifth. He yanked Jim Langer, another Hall of Famer, off the waiver wire.\n\nThere were disappointments, sure. He never won a Super Bowl with Marino. In Super Bowl III — in Miami no less — his Colts suffered the greatest upset in NFL history, which had been guaranteed by Jets quarterback “Broadway” Joe Namath.\n\n“My relationship with (Colts owner) Carroll Rosenbloom was never quite the same after that,” Shula said. “He had his office in New York and he took a lot of heat from his New York buddies. Then he would get on the phone and pass that heat on to me. I lasted another year, but it led to me listening to other offers and eventually going to Miami.”\n\nFew losses angered him as much as a December 1982 game at New England in which Mark Henderson, a prisoner on work-release, drove a snowplow onto the field to clear a spot for a field goal with 4:45 left, giving the Patriots a 3-0 victory. Why didn’t Shula try to stop it? As a longtime member of the NFL’s competition committee, he was dumbfounded that anyone would even think of such a thing.\n\n“The key is having respect for the people you’re competing against,” is how Shula defined sportsmanship in 2002. “As the head coach, I always tried to convey to the people I was responsible for that winning certainly was the ultimate goal, but we always wanted to be a team that was known as being good sportsmen and winning within the rules and doing things the right way.”\n\nGreat coach, greater traits\n\nShula therefore had no use for those who pushed the ethical envelope. “You mean Beli-cheat?” he said of Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Although Belichick won six rings with the Patriots, in the eyes of Shula (and likely many in South Florida), the cloud of suspicion hovering over him from ”-gate” scandals disqualifies him from claims that he, not Shula, is the best ever.\n\nTed Hendricks, the Raiders Hall of Famer from the University of Miami, once called Shula “the most honest man in the U.S.”\n\nHonesty. That’s one word often attached to Don Shula.\n\nPerseverant. That’s another.\n\n“If a nuclear bomb is dropped, the only things I’m certain will survive are AstroTurf and Don Shula,” defensive end Bubba Smith said.\n\nIntegrity. That’s a third.\n\nAfter victory No. 325, many wondered why Shula wasn’t given a Gatorade bath. The answer can be traced to the 1973 Super Bowl, the one that would complete perfection. That’s when Shula was asked how he’d want to be remembered.\n\n“Didn’t lie to anyone, didn’t screw anybody, traveled first class,” Shula told Pope.\n\nShula wasn’t defining first class as the front of the aircraft. He meant with dignity. So after that win in Philadelphia, “We looked at the Gatorade and said, ‘You know, we need to do a classy thing,’ ” guard Keith Sims said.\n\nSims and two other linemen carried Shula across the field on their shoulders, replicating his Super Bowl victory ride in Los Angeles, which had produced what is likely the defining photograph of his career.\n\nOld-school style, old-school perfect.\n\nEven the Eagles fans gave Shula a standing ovation.\n\nThey had to.\n\nDon Shula had become the best ever.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/04"}]}

He assisted on an insurance goal from Michael Olise – a similar score from outside the box, and Schulte could not reach the far post in time.\n\nFrance walked away with a 3-0 victory in a packed Marseille Stadium, adding a late header from Loic Bade.\n\nPaxten Aaronson led the U.S. with two shots on goal. France outshot the U.S. 11-9, and the discrepancy in shots on goal was similar (6-4). France did take six corners – five in the first half – to the Americans’ two.\n\nIt was a physical match, with the U.S. typically on the friendly side of referee Yael Falcon’s whistle.\n\nThe top two teams from each group will advance so the Americans still have a shot to advance. The Americans will play New Zealand on Saturday in Marseille.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nParis Olympics begin with soccer, rugby\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics soft launched on-field action Wednesday, with eight men’s soccer matches and 12 men’s rugby sevens matches.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. men's gymnastics team had podium training, and the U.S. men's basketball team practiced ahead of their first game Sunday.\n\nHere's how Wednesday happened in France:\n\nGoal! France 3, USA 0\n\nMARSEILLE, France — For good measure, Loic Bade hammered home a header to give the French another goal that will help the team if tiebreaking comes into play. But the result was already in hand by that point.\n\nGoal! France 2, USA 0\n\nMARSEILLE, France — France is pulling away.\n\nMichael Olise beat U.S. goalkeeper Patrick Schulte to the right for France’s second goal in eight minutes, and the U.S. is staring down defeat as a result.\n\nThe U.S. hasn’t been without its opportunities in the second half and could have netted a score or two itself. But France’s finishing has put them in a comfortable lead with 20 minutes to play.\n\nGoal! France 1, USMNT 0\n\nMARSEILLE, France — The most experienced man on the pitch scored the match’s first goal.\n\nFrance forward Alexander Lacazette beat USA goalkeeper Patrick Schulte to the far corner in the 61st minute. Michael Olise was credited with the assist.\n\nThe U.S. nearly equalized on two separate occasions in short order, the second of which was a golden opportunity for the Americans. John Tolkin streaked in to receive a cross, but French keeper Guillaume Restes caused enough disturbance to deter the threat. Paxten Aaronson’s header minutes before that was also turned away.\n\nDjordje Mihailovic hits crossbar\n\nMARSEILLE, France — The U.S. is playing with more urgency – despite spending plenty of time on the ground after French contact – and nearly broke through in the 59th minute.\n\nDjordje Mihailovic’s strike drilled the crossbar square and ricocheted over the net for a goal kick. It was the closest the Americans have come to scoring by far in the match.\n\nEarlier in the half, Nathan Harriel had an early header on target.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nHalftime: USA 0, France 0\n\nMARSEILLE, France — Jean-Philippe Mateta nearly supplied France with its first goal of the match on two separate occasions in the closing minutes of the first half, which the French dominated and forced the Americans on their heels.\n\nMateta first had a chance to connect on a long ball into the box, but wasn’t able to put enough behind the attempt and U.S. goalkeeper Patrick Schulte made the save.\n\nSchulte had to make another save on a ball from Manu Kone that appeared to be a cross but was bound for the back of the net had he not dived to his left and pushed the threat away.\n\nMateta again fired off a low shot from the top of the box that went just wide of the ride post.\n\nFrance outshot the U.S. 8-3 (3-1 on target) and had five corners compared to one for the U.S. The French had 61% possession.\n\nPaxten Aaronson has been the most active American in the attack, but there hasn’t been much to report for the U.S. on that end outside of a few chances.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSMNT vs. France: Finally a shot!\n\nMARSEILLE, France — It took more than 30 minutes, but there was a shot on goal.\n\nFrance’s Manu Kone let one rip from beyond the box and wasn’t that much of threat, however. USA keeper Patrick Schulte dove to his right and easily secured the ball.\n\nA few minutes later, Kevin Paredes picked up the first yellow card for the Americans.\n\nPaxten Aaronson then finally delivered the first shot on net for the USA, which French keeper Guillaume Restes deflected back into play.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSMNT vs France: Scoreless first 30 minutes\n\nMARSEILLE, France — American defender John Tolkin writhed in pain and France’s Kiliann Sildillia drew a yellow card. France has had more pressure but the Americans have defended well enough in the first half hour.\n\nU.S. goalkeeper Patrick Shulte did well to be aggressive on France’s first corner and claim the ball. The French midfield has been aggressive in trying to keep the U.S. pinned in its own third but have been called for a few fouls to help the U.S. alleviate the pressure.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nOlympic soccer: USMNT vs. France underway\n\nMARSEILLE, France — For the first time in 16 years, the U.S. men’s U-23 national team is back in the Olympics.\n\nThe best finish for the U.S. men was a fourth-place showing at the Sydney Games in 2000.\n\nBy winning the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Honduras, the team clinched its spot in the 2024 Olympics.\n\nSince 1992 in Barcelona, the men’s soccer Olympic tournament has been played with players age 23 or younger. Each squad is allowed to carry three overage players if they choose.\n\nThe lone senior national team member with previous World Cup experience is defender Walker Zimmerman. Defender Miles Robinson and midfielder Djordje Mihailovic are the other overage players.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nThiery Henry takes Olympic stage with France\n\nMARSEILLE, France – Although fans may not recognize most of France’s roster, even casuals know its manager: Thierry Henry.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Henry began his coaching journey with Arsenal’s youth academy in 2015. He had been an assistant for Belgium’s national squad during its run to the World Cup semifinal in 2018.\n\nHenry’s other managerial roles have included Ligue 1’s Monaco and CF Montréal of Major League Soccer.\n\nAs a player, Henry helped France win the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship. He ranks as the second all-time leading scorer (51) for “Les Bleus.”\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSMNT vs. France: Host nation's fans out in force\n\nMARSEILLE, France – Fans of the host country were out in full force hours before kickoff, wearing blue and waving French flags.\n\nWith no fans at the Tokyo Summer Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games due to COVID-19, the eruptions from the France-heavy crowd will be a reminder of the Olympics’ draw.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nMedal count today\n\nOur 2024 Paris Olympics medal count tracker updates after every single medal event.

And like in the opener against Zambia, the scoring came early and often before the Americans cruised to a relatively stress-free victory.\n\nIt was an all-around effort for the U.S. Sophia Smith scored twice, Mallory Swanson punched in her third of the tournament and Lynn Williams also scored to account for the Americans’ goals. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher stood stout in worrying moments and finished with four saves.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nIs Kevin Durant the greatest Olympic basketball player ever?\n\nVILLENEUVE-D'ASCQ, France – Kevin Durant off the bench isn’t fair. Durant making shot after shot after shot – eight consecutive attempts to be precise – isn’t fair either.\n\nPoor Serbia, looking to upset the U.S. men’s basketball team at the 2024 Paris Olympics and here comes Durant, who hadn’t played in a game since the Phoenix Suns lost in the first round of the playoffs in April, picking apart Serbia.\n\nDurant scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half and led the U.S. to a 110-84 victory over Serbia, sending a message that with Durant on the court, it’s not the same team that almost lost to South Sudan and squeezed by Germany in pre-Olympic tuneups.\n\n“I was tired. I'm not going to lie to you,” Durant said. “My lungs were getting used to that heat, the intensity of the game, but it felt good to make some shots. Everybody played their role pretty well tonight. My role was to come in, provide space and shot-making for the team.”\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nSara Hughes, Kelly Cheng win in beach volleyball group play\n\nTeam USA's Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, the No. 3-seeded team, scored an easy 2-0 win (21-16, 21-11) over the Czech Republic's Barbora Hermannova and Marie-Sara Stochlova in a Group C women's match in beach volleyball. The American duo came into the Paris Olympics on a roll after winning the 2023 FIVB World Championship title. Before turning pro in 2018, the pair won 103 consecutive matches for the University of Southern California and notched the sport’s first two NCAA titles.\n\nParis Olympics organizers apologize after 'The Last Supper' backlash\n\nParis Olympic organizers apologized Sunday to people offended during a tableau of the opening ceremony that critics said mocked \"The Last Supper.\"\n\nThomas Jolly, the opening ceremony’s artistic director, said on French TV station BFMTV on Sunday, \"The Last Supper\" was \"not my inspiration\" and the \"idea was to have a pagan celebration connected to the gods of Olympus.\"\n\nStill, Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps apologized on Sunday for those offended by the scene.\n\n\"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. On the contrary, I think (with) Thomas Jolly, we really did try to celebrate community tolerance,\" Descamps said. “Looking at the result of the polls that we shared, we believe that this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really, really sorry.”\n\n- Jordan Mendoza\n\nNBC announces big ratings from opening ceremony\n\nNBC announced its viewership ratings from the first days of the Paris Olympics, boasting 28.6 million viewers across all platforms for Friday's opening ceremony, the network's most-watched since 2012.\n\nOn Saturday, NBC reported more than 32 million viewers for the first full day of competition, an 83% increase from the opening Saturday of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.\n\nNic Fink wins silver in breaststroke\n\nNANTERRE, France — American breaststroker Nic Fink finally won himself an Olympic medal, tying world record holder Adam Peaty of Great Britain for silver in the men’s 100-meter breaststroke final Sunday night at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nOn the second day of swimming competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Peaty and Fink finished with an identical time of 59.05. They were just out-touched at the wall by gold medal winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy, who swam 59.03.\n\nFink, a 31-year-old two-time Olympian, advanced to the final ranked fourth, needing to drop a little off his 59.16 semifinals swim Saturday. He shaved off .11 seconds to earn a spot on the Olympic podium in his only individual event in Paris.\n\n– Michelle Martinelli\n\nTeam USA's Torri Huske, Gretchen Walsh win gold, silver in butterfly 100\n\nNANTERRE, France —In a battle of the fastest women’s butterfly swimmers in history, Americans Torri Huske won the gold medal in 55.59 seconds and American Gretchen Walsh won the silver in 55.63.\n\nHuske and Walsh both won silver medals Saturday night as part of the U.S. women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay team.\n\nFor Huske, a 21-year-old former U.S. record holder taking a gap year from Stanford, this was a chance to perfect her performance in a race she nearly won three years ago. She ended up finishing fourth in the 100 butterfly in Tokyo after appearing to take the lead 10 meters from the finish. Huske did win a silver medal in the women’s 4x100 medley relay in 2021.\n\n– Christine Brennan\n\nLee Kiefer, Lauren Scruggs win gold and silver in fencing\n\nPARIS − A pair of American women fencers on Sunday night won a pair of coveted Olympic medals – one gold and one silver.\n\nLee Kiefer beat teammate Lauren Scruggs at the Paris Games in the final bout of the women’s individual foil competition that showcased U.S. talent.\n\nArguably, some of the best fencing talent the United States has ever produced.\n\nIt was on display not only in the golden medal bout – which Kiefer won 15-6 – but during the daylong competition that ended with an All-American final.\n\n– Josh Peter\n\nOlympic tennis: Coco Cauff wins singles opener\n\nPARIS — Coco Gauff, perhaps the Americans’ best chance to win a medal in tennis, started her singles run with a dominant 6-3, 6-0 victory over Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic.\n\nAmerican fans may remember Tomljanovic as the player who ended Serena Williams’ career at the 2023 US Open in a three-set thriller. Since then, however, Tomljanovic has struggled with injury and used a protected ranking to secure her spot on Australia’s Olympic team.\n\nAs for the 21-year old Gauff, who is seeded No. 2 and was Team USA’s female flagbearer at Friday’s opening ceremony, it was more or less an ideal start to the Olympics. On Sunday, she teamed with Jessica Pegula for a first-round victory in doubles. Gauff is also playing mixed doubles with Taylor Fritz.\n\nShe continues in singles Monday against Maria Lourdes Carles of Argentina, who is ranked 89th in the world. That match should start at around 7:30 or 8 a.m. ET, depending on how quickly the day’s first match finishes on Suzanne Lenglen Court.\n\n– Dan Wolken\n\nWhy Jayson Tatum didn't play in Team USA basketball win over Serbia\n\nVILLENEUVE-D'ASCQ, France – Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is coming off an NBA title in June and another All-NBA selection in 2023-24.\n\nYet Tatum didn’t play in the USA’s 110-84 victory against Serbia Sunday in the men’s 5x5 basketball Group C opener for both teams at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nU.S. coach Steve Kerr explained his decision and talked to Tatum about it.\n\n“It's really hard in a 40-minute game to play more than 10 guys, and with Kevin (Durant) coming back, I just went to the combinations that I felt would make the most sense,” Kerr said. “It seems crazy. I thought I was crazy when I looked at everything and determined these are the lineups I want to get to. Jayson's first-team All-NBA three years in a row, he's one of the best players in the world.\n\n“He's incredibly professional, and that's tonight. That doesn't mean it's going to stay that way the rest of the tournament, so he'll make his mark. But the key, and our guys know this, is to put all the NBA stuff in the rearview mirror and just win six games, and Jayson's the ultimate pro and champion and he handled it well and he's going to be ready for the next one.”\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSWNT vs. Germany starting lineup\n\nTeam USA continues their Olympic slate vs. Germany at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday.

We got to still earn our respect. We just got to continue to show the world what we're capable of. That is just a testament to people not respecting us still, so we took that as fuel.”\n\nIt was Sudan’s anthem that was played, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nSaid South Sudan’s Majok Deng: “They have to be better because this is the biggest stage, and you know that South Sudan is playing. There's no way you can get that wrong by playing a different anthem. It’s disrespectful. I don't know. I don't want to say anything, but to us it didn't feel right, and that kind of delayed the game. For you to play a different anthem, I don't think it's the right thing. Obviously, nobody’s perfect. They made a mistake.

More specifically though, the 2028 Los Angeles Games' opening ceremony is set for July 14, 2028, with the closing ceremony happening just over two weeks later on July 30, 2028. — Jon Hoefling\n\nOne more look from Stade de France\n\nAfter the transition to Los Angeles, we were treated to one more trip back to Paris where French singer Yseult was waiting to perform a classic made famous stateside by Frank Sinatra, \"My Way.\" Her rendition of the tune was remarkable, and was capped off with a multitude of fireworks, a very fitting and extravagant end to an unforgettable Olympics. — Jon Hoefling\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre rock Long Beach\n\nTo cap off the closing ceremony, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, alongside Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre offered a mini concert on the beach.\n\nTom Cruise performs his 'epic stunt'\n\nIt had been rumored for a few days that Cruise would be performing a stunt of epic proportions to symbolize the transition from Paris to Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympics. Cruise did not disappoint.\n\nCruise rappelled down Stade de France into a crowd of athletes, who all met him with high-fives. Cruise then made his way to the stage to take the Olympic flag from Simone Biles and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. In classic Tom Cruise fashion, he then hopped on a motorcycle and rode out of the stadium and onto a plane.\n\nThe plane went straight to Los Angeles, and viewers were treated to the 62-year-old movie star skydiving onto the Hollywood sign, altering the two O's in Hollywood into the Olympic rings. The flag was then carried throughout LA, through iconic venues such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Long Beach, where the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre were waiting to offer a mini-concert. — Jon Hoefling\n\nSimone Biles shows at closing ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Simone Biles made a surprise appearance at the closing ceremony, playing a part in the passing of the Olympic flag from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nBiles stood with Bass while H.E.R. played the national anthem. She is still wearing a walking boot on her left leg after competing with a strained calf during the Paris Games. — Thomas Schad\n\nH.E.R. performs Star-Spangled Banner\n\nAfter the passing of the flag, Stade de France was treated to a beautiful rendition of the American national anthem from five-time Grammy Award-winning artist H.E.R. — Jon Hoefling\n\nMayor Anne Hidalgo passes Olympic flag to Mayor Karen Bass from Los Angeles\n\nFollowing several earnest goodbyes from several French representatives, the flag was officially handed over to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who wasted no time waving it for the world to see. — Jon Hoefling\n\nParis 2024 president with a heartfelt farewell to the Games\n\nThe city of Paris had been preparing for these Olympics for near a decade, and tonight, it says goodbye. The president of Paris 2024 offered a very emotional goodbye to the Olympics.\n\nWhat to know about Stade de France?\n\nStade de France (Stadium of France) was built to host the 1998 soccer World Cup. It is located just north of Paris in Saint-Denis. It's where the athletics events took place, as well as rugby sevens. It has a seating capacity of about 80,000, making it the largest stadium in France. Tonight every single one appears to be taken. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nLos Angeles 2028 update\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and LA28 Olympic Games chair Casey Wasserman, who are both here tonight, told reporters on Saturday that while the Paris Games have been \"authentically French,\" the 2028 Games will be \"authentically Los Angeles.\" The jury's out on that for another four years but Wasserman said this meant tapping into LA's music, fashion, culture and of course movies pedigree.\n\n\"We don't have an Eiffel Tower. We do have a Hollywood sign,\" said Wasserman. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nPhoenix, Kavinsky bring the party to closing ceremony\n\nThe first of many musicians to come onto stage for these closing ceremonies was Phoenix, a French indie band from Versailles. The group played their 2009 hit song \"Lisztomania\" from their fourth album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix was followed by French musician Kavinsky, who played his 2010 single Nightcall. Phoenix and Nightcall combined for a three-song set to entertain the crowd, and it was quite a show for such a short set. — Jon Hoefling\n\nAthletes rush the stage\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Athletes from several nations, including Team USA athletes, rushed the stage, albeit in a somewhat orderly fashion. They seemed to be joining performers who ran out of tunnels onto the stage.\n\nBut then broadcast across the stadium was this message in English: \"Please don’t stand on the stage. Please get down from the stage, dear athletes. … Dear athletes, please leave the stage.\" — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWhat was the final medal count at 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe United States finished this year's games with the most medals (126) of any competing country. They also finished the Olympics tied for the most gold medals (40) alongside China.\n\nFind the full final medal count here.\n\nOlympic rings come together in Paris\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Leading up to the giant, golden Olympic rings coming into place above the stage, the Hymn to Apollo — the oldest hymn from ancient Greece — was performed by Alain Roche. But perhaps you noticed he, amazingly, was seated and playing a piano while suspended vertically in the air. Because the stadium was dark, it was challenging to notice this in person.\n\nThe hymn was discovered in the ruins of Delphi and was first performed in modern times to celebrate the 1894 revival of the Olympics two years later. The ancient score is in the Louvre. — Michelle Martinelli\n\n'The Golden Voyager' hits the stage at closing ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The stadium went dark, save for people’s phone flashlights and dramatic periodic flashing lights on the stage. The idea was to transport viewers to another world that is dark, deserted and mysterious, opening the door for the arrival of The Golden Voyager.\n\nCovered in golden sparkles and lowered down into the stadium, The Golden Voyager was inspired by elements of French history, including the Spirit of the Bastille, the Génie de la Liberté — a 1836 bronze-gilded statue signifying liberty by Auguste Dumont — and video games and science fiction.\n\nThe Golden Voyager character is also a nod to the Voyager Golden Record, which the Voyager spacecraft launched into the void in 1977 \"containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth\", should other spacefarers find it, according to NASA. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWomen's marathon medal ceremony\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The women’s marathon was one of the last events at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday morning, and the three medalists received their hardware at the closing ceremony: Netherlands’ gold medalist Sifan Hassan, Ethiopia’s silver medalist Tigst Assefa and Kenya’s bronze medalist Hellen Obiri. The crowd roared when Hassan was introduced.\n\nThe ceremony also paid video tribute to the Marathon Pour Tous, or the Marathon For All — a public event where people ran parts or the whole course on Saturday night. There were 20,024 participants registered.\n\nThe marathon route was inspired by the legendary Women’s March of 1789, where Parisians revolted over King Louis XVI’s apathy toward a flour shortage. They marched from through Paris to Versailles to bring the king back to the city in a moment the French remember for its defense of human rights and freedom. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nWhat's in the boxes Olympic medalists receive?\n\nEach Olympic medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics also receives a box while they're standing on the podium, but what's inside?\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee, it's the official poster for this year's Games. French artist Ugo Gattoni designed this year's posters over several months of work.\n\nRead more on what medalists have received this Olympics from Jordan Mendoza.\n\nKatie Ledecky and Nick Mead represent the U.S. as flag bearers\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Katie Ledecky doesn’t usually get to attend the Olympics opening ceremony because of her swimming schedule, but Sunday night, she was one of Team USA’s flag bearers at the closing ceremony, joined by rower Nick Mead.\n\nWhen she found out she was chosen as the flag bearer, Ledecky teared up when fellow 1,500 freestyle Olympic champion Bobby Finke delivered the news.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, Ledecky and Mead entered with all the nations’ flag bearers, donning their vintage NASCAR-esque Ralph Lauren outfits. They both looked excited walking around the stage at the booming stadium.\n\nMead, a 29-year-old first-time Olympian, was part of the men’s four team that won gold for the U.S. for the first time since the 1960 Olympics.\n\nWith 14 total medals, Ledecky, a 27-year-old four-time Olympian, is the most decorated American woman at the Olympics in any sport and the most decorated woman in swimming of all time. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nFlag bearers' procession into the Stade de France begins\n\nFollowing tradition, Greece leads the procession of all nations that participated in this year's Olympics into the arena.

He carried the lantern out of the Jardin des Tuileries and began his procession to bring the flame to the Stade de France. — Jack McKessy\n\nClosing ceremony begins with musical performance\n\nThe closing ceremony festivities began in front of the 2024 Paris Olympics' Olympic torch in the Jardin des Tuileries. French singer Zaho de Sagazan and the Choir of the Haendel-Hendrix Academy treated spectators to a rendition of \"Sous le ciel de Paris.\" — Jack McKessy\n\nCasey Wasserman on the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nThe chairman of the LA28 Organizing Committee sat down with NBC's Mike Tirico to discuss what to expect in four years' time, when the Olympics return to the U.S. for the first time since 1996. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhat is Team USA's closing ceremony outfit?\n\nAs in the opening ceremony, Ralph Lauren is the designer of Team USA's closing ceremony outfits.

NBC will broadcast the ceremony, which is expected to conclude a little after 5 p.m.\n\nThere will also be an encore broadcast of the closing ceremony starting at 7 p.m. ET. — Jack McKessy\n\nWhy did Gabby Williams play for France?\n\nGabby Williams, the No. 4 overall pick out of UConn in 2018, was one of France's best players at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She was drafted by the Chicago Sky but started playing overseas full time after the 2022 season.\n\nWilliams is from the United States but is eligible to play for France in the Olympics due to her mother, Therese, being from the host country of this year's Olympic Games. Williams also competed in the Tokyo Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the last competition. — Austin Curtright\n\nA'ja Wilson had NSFW answer to describe Kahleah Copper's performance\n\nKahleah Copper played a huge role for Team USA, coming off the bench to score 10 of her 12 points in the fourth quarter. Copper sank two crucial free throws with 3.9 seconds left that enabled the Americans to withstand Williams' buzzer beater.\n\nWhen asked for one word to describe the performance of Copper, Wilson gave a two-word term of endearment to describe the Phoenix Mercury All-Star guard.\n\n\"That (expletive)!\" Wilson said before giving a look into the camera that let the rest of the world know they were sleeping on Copper's skills. — Scooby Axson\n\nUSA women's hoops hang on for eighth consecutive gold\n\nWith the U.S. clinging to a 62-59 lead, Breanna Stewart got a fingertip on France’s 3 attempt, a huge defensive play with 20 seconds to go. At the other end, A'Ja Wilson hit one of two free throws to make it a two possession game.\n\nFrance’s Gabby Williams hit a shot at the buzzer but the forward wasn’t behind the 3-point line when it left her hand, leaving France short of tying the game and leaving the U.S. with a one-point victory, 67-66. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women hold 3-point lead with less than a minute left\n\nAfter Gabby Williams hit a long 2 for France with about 1:30 left, Kahleah Cooper answered with a layup out of the timeout to give the Americans a 62-59 lead with 54 seconds left. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nUS women's hoops reclaims lead at end of 3Q\n\nThe national emergency appears to be over — for now. A’ja Wilson is getting ticked off, and that’s usually when the Americans start rolling. Wilson is up to four blocks (it feels like more) and dominated the third quarter defensively when the U.S. really needed it. She’s got 14 points and 12 rebounds. Two nice Sabrina Ionescu-to-Napheesa Collier baskets also helped the Americans get back into it after trailing by 10. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nFrance starts second half with surge\n\nA lot of people thought the U.S. would have a cakewalk to its eighth consecutive gold. France has other ideas. After an 8-0 run that gave the French a 33-25 lead to open the second half, the U.S. needed a timeout to talk things over. This crowd is only going to get louder. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nEvacuation takes place near Eiffel Tower\n\nFrench police briefly evacuated the area around the Eiffel Tower on Sunday after there were reports a man attempted to climb the 1,083-foot structure. The incident, reported by the Associated Press and in unverified eyewitness posts on social media, took place just hours before the Olympic closing ceremony was due to get underway. The shirtless man was spotted just above the Olympic rings that decorate the second section of Paris' famous landmark, the city's tallest building. The Eiffel Tower was a centerpiece of the opening ceremony. A purpose-built stadium directly in front of it hosted beach volleyball events. Blind football events will be played there during the Paralympics. The tower is not part of the closing ceremony. — Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS women's hoops tied with France at halftime\n\nThe women's basketball gold medal game is all tied up at the half after a crucial tip-in from Team USA’s Napheesa Collier just before the buzzer.\n\nReal talk: That half was ugly. The U.S. shot 29%, France shot 28% and the teams combined for 19 total turnovers. A’ja Wilson has six points but is just 2-of-9 from the field, while Stewart is 1-of-6 with five points. Wilson and Collier have nine rebounds each. Gabby Williams leads France with eight points.\n\nThe U.S. looks sloppy and disjointed and if it wants to keep the streak of seven-gold-medals-in-a-row-and-counting going, the Americans going to need to clean up a lot in the second half. — Lindsay Schnell, Nancy Armour\n\nSifan Hassan's Olympic feat arguably greatest in Summer Games history\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan and Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa tangled. They jostled. They were one false move away from taking each other out. Then, in the blink of an eye, Hassan was gone; a blur of Netherlands orange leaving Assefa behind and streaking to the gold medal. And when she crossed the wire in an Olympic record 2 hours, 22 minutes and 55 seconds, there was just one question left.\n\nHow is it possible for a human to do this?\n\nRead Dan Wolken's column on the extraordinary performance in the women's Olympic marathon.\n\nUSA men’s water polo wins bronze in shootout\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA men’s water polo were victorious in a thrilling 11-8 bronze-medal match that ended in a shootout against historical powerhouse Hungary on Sunday to win its first Olympic medal since 2008.\n\nThe American’s not only won the match and bronze medal, but they also shut out Hungary in the shootout, 3-0, at París La Défense Arena.\n\nUSA goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg – who stood on his head, especially in the final minutes and was spectacular in the shootout – made 16 saves on 24 shots, while American captain Ben Hallock led the team in scoring with two goals.\n\nRead more on Weinberg from Michelle Martinelli.\n\nAmerican cyclist takes gold in women's Omnium\n\nAmerican Jennifer Valente won her second consecutive gold medal in women’s Omnium cycling at the National Velodrome on Sunday.\n\nValente totaled 144 points, edging Poland’s Daria Pikulik (silver) and New Zealand’s Ally Wollaston (bronze). Omnium consists of four races (scratch race, tempo race, elimination and points), and points are awarded for each race. Valente won the 2022 and 2023 world championship in Omnium.\n\n\"It’s been a really long week of racing. I raced (team pursuit) qualifying over a week ago, and we had some really good performances, so to pull it off on the last day, I'm really excited,\" Valante said.\n\nValente, who won the event three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, was also part of the squad that won gold in team pursuit in Paris. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA women's hoops goes for eighth consecutive gold\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team gets to bring down the curtain on the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn the final event of these Games, the United States plays France with an eighth consecutive gold medal on the line. The Americans have mostly cruised through this Olympics tournaments, with each of their five wins coming by double digits, and three coming by 19 or more points. A'ja Wilson (18.2 points per game) and Breanna Stewart (18.0) have been leading the way, with Wilson also leading the team in rebounds (9.6), blocks (2.4) and steals (1.6).\n\nFollow along for updates and highlights.\n\nIOC has precedent to give two bronzes for gymnastics floor routine\n\nIn stripping Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal, the International Olympic Committee is not following the precedent it set for itself in the most publicized double-medal controversy in Olympic history.\n\nAt the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, in what became known as the French judge scandal, the IOC gave out two gold medals – to Canada and Russia – rather than take the gold medal from the Russian pairs skaters nearly a week after they received it, as it should have.\n\nRead more from Christine Brennan.\n\nItaly beats USA for gold medal in women's volleyball\n\nPARIS — The repeat dream is over for the U.S. women’s volleyball. Italy swept the Americans (25-18, 25-20, 25-17) in a match that lasted 81 minutes to deny the USA a second consecutive gold medal.\n\nItaly’s opposite hitter Paola Egonu supplied the bulk of her team’s attack, as she went off for 22 kills and was by far the best player on the court.\n\nJordan Thompson led the Americans with eight attack points.

The Americans could not navigate Italy’s block, and Italy finished with four block points in the frame.\n\nU.S. coach Karch Kiraly burned both timeouts by the time his team trailed 12-6.

The Romanian Gymnastics Federation had challenged the validity of that move, saying it was filed four seconds beyond the deadline by which any inquiries had to be submitted.\n\nThe IOC said in a statement that it will reallocate the bronze medal to Romania's Ana Barbosu. — Nancy Armour and Tom Schad\n\nNetherlands' Sifan Hassan wins women's marathon\n\nSifan Hassan — who won the bronze medal in both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter race — completed an incredible 2024 Paris Olympics by winning the women's marathon on Sunday, finishing in an Olympic record time of 2:22:55.\n\nIt required a late sprint to the finish for the track star, who out-paced Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa to the finish line of the 26.2-mile race. Assefa finished three seconds behind Hassan to win silver. Kenya's Hellen Obiri won the bronze.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm finishes 12th in women's marathon\n\nPARIS — Near the halfway point of the women’s marathon on Sunday, American Dakotah Lindwurm found herself in the lead. It was a scenario the former hockey player from Minnesota, ranked No. 138 in the world, could have never imagined.\n\n“I looked up and said, ‘God, you’re crazy – I can’t believe I’m at the front of the Olympic marathon right now,’” she said. “But you’ve got to put yourself in that position if you want to run well, and I’m not afraid to take the lead. I never have been, and it was fun.”\n\nThough it was a temporary thrill, Lindwurm surpassed all expectations by finishing 12th on the difficult, hilly course in a time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 44 seconds. The only disappointment was that she couldn't stay in the top 10, finishing 34 seconds behind that milestone.\n\nStill, being at the head of the pack was something she'll always remember. She even choked up a bit talking about the fact that she wasn't the most likely Olympian and how happy she was just to be a part of this event.\n\n“I swear I could hear all of Minnesota cheering for me in the moment when I took the lead,” she said.\n\nLindwurm led the American contingent, as Emily Sisson finished 23rd and Fiona O’Keefe dropped off the pace and stopped just a few kilometers into the race due to injury.\n\nSisson, who qualified for the Olympic team in Tokyo for the 10k, said her run did not meet expectations.\n\n“I’m pretty disappointed,” she said. “Pretty sad. I think there were signs. Three marathons in a year is too much for me. I had some good workouts and no major injuries or anything. I like challenging myself and wanted to do a fall marathon for learning experience and it did help me in the trials. Btu this marathon didn’t feel like the last two, like I needed to freshen up my legs. Lesson learned, unfortunately.”\n\nBoth Americans were amazed to learn that Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands had won the race, barely outfinishing Tigst Assefa of Ethiopa. The marathon was Hassan’s third event of these Olympics, having already won bronze medals in both the 5k and 10k.\n\n“Oh my God,” Lindwurm said. \"My legs are trashed and I don’t know how she’s running on tired legs. She’s amazing.”\n\nSaid Sisson: “I’m not surprised. She’s a generational talent. I think she is solidified as the GOAT now, if she wasn’t already.” — Dan Wolken\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm drops off lead pace in marathon\n\nDakotah Lindwurm managed to stick with the lead runners through the 13.1-kilometer halfway point, but has since dropped off the pace set by the lead pack.\n\nThrough 30k, Lindwurm — the lead American runner — was 46 seconds behind the leaders. Another America, Emily Sisson, was more than two minutes behind the leaders.\n\nStill attached to the lead group of Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, winner of the bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000 at Stade de France. The lead group also included three Kenyan runners (Sharon Lokedi, Peres Jepchirchir and Hellen Obiri), two Ethiopians (Tigst Assefa and Amane Beriso Shankule), Romania's Delvine Relin Meringor, Japan's Yuka Suzuki and Bahrain's Eunice Chebichii Chumba. Lokedi clocked in with the top time through 30k at 1:43:59.\n\nAmerican Dakotah Lindwurm pacing with lead group in marathon\n\nThe women's marathon is underway in Paris, and 29-year-old American Dakotah Lindwurm was right in the mix with the lead group through the halfway point of the race.\n\nLindwurm was in third place with a time of 1:13:25 at the 13.1-kilometer mark, with Australia's Jessica Stenson just ahead in first place at 1:13:22. Lindwurm was among 20 runners that comprise the lead group.\n\nThe Netherlands' Sifan Hassan, who also won bronze medals in the women's 5,000- and 10,000-meter races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, also is among those runners in the lead group.\n\nFellow American Emily Sisson was 27 seconds off the lead. A third American in the race, Fiona O'Keeffe, dropped out of the race during the opening miles.\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.

While Dolgorjav was in on a single-leg shot, Hildebrandt slipped out of the Mongolian's grasp and countered with a single-leg takedown of her own. After a passivity point, she led 5-0 going into the second period and held on for a victory.\n\nHildebrandt, despite a significant height advantage, broke free or held on for a whistle on three shots that Dolgorjav was in deep on her legs to secure a shutout victory. While Dolgorjav had gotten the best of her on two occassions at the world championships prior, Hildebrandt was the more technically sound and tougher wrestler in this match.\n\nHildebrandt will face India's Vinesh Phogat, who has bursted onto the scene for the first time as a three-time Olympian by defeating Japan superstar Yui Susaki (four-time world champion and Tokyo Olympic gold medalist) in the first round.

Soon after that bout, Khelif was disqualified for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests, according to the International Boxing Association (IBA), a discredited group that has no role in the Olympics.\n\nThe IOC said Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting, another female boxer disqualified at the 2023 world championships, both met all criteria to participate in the women's competition. They also competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nLike Khelif, Lin has excelled here inside the ring.

Brazil surged to a 3-0 lead on a headed goal by Adriana, before Spain finally got on the board late in regulation on Salma Paralluelo's goal. Brazil made it 4-1 with a breakaway goal in the first minute of extra time. Kerolin's timely interception left her unguarded and sprinting towards goal. She fired the ball between Spanish keeper Cata Coll's legs to give Brazil a three-goal lead.\n\nBut Spain wasn't done and neither was Salma Paralluelo. After scoring her team's first goal in the 85th minute, notched her second of the match in the 12th minute of stoppage time.

Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh will play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nBrazil dominating Spain in women's soccer semifinal\n\nBrazil jumped out to a huge 3-0 lead over Spain in the second women's soccer semifinal of the 2024 Paris Olympics before the defending Women's World Cup finally got on the board in the closing minutes of regulation.\n\nAn attack by Brazil leads to mayhem in front of the goal, but Adriana's header off a headed pass from Gabi Portilho put As Canarinhas up 3-0 in the 72nd minute. Spain countered with a goal by Salma Paralluelo in the 85th minute, off an assist by Jennifer Hermoso, to make it 3-1.\n\nThe winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match on Saturday. The loser faces Germany for bronze.\n\nU.S. men's basketball team up big on Brazil at halftime of quarterfinal\n\nPARIS — Joel Embiid hears the boos from the French fans. It doesn’t bother him. Or at least it didn’t in the first half of the U.S. quarterfinals game against Brazil.\n\nEmbiid scored a team-high 14 points and had seven rebounds as the U.S. took a 63-36 lead into halftime against Brazil.\n\nBrazil had a trimmed a 19-point deficit to 42-34, but the U.S. the half on a 21-4 run.

The U.S. also limited Brazil’s offensive rebounds to four, and it entered the game as the best offensive rebounding team in the tournament at 13 per game.\n\nRight now, it’s too many defenders, rebounders and scorers for Brazil to handle. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nAmit Elor wins gold for USA, cements her status as rising wrestling star\n\nPARIS — Team USA's Amit Elor won the first gold medal of her promising wrestling career Tuesday at the 2024 Paris Olympics, crushing her latest opponent in the women's 68-kilogram weight class − Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan − just like she has crushed almost everyone else who has stepped onto the mat with her over the past four-plus years.\n\nElor's 3-0 victory in the gold-medal match at Champ-de-Mars Arena gives her 41 consecutive victories at the international level, across age divisions, dating back to 2019. It also makes Elor, 20, the youngest Olympic gold medalist in the history of U.S. wrestling and just the third American woman to take gold, joining two of her idols: Helen Maroulis and Tamyra Mensah-Stock.\n\nElor has won eight world championships in three different age divisions − including senior, under-23 and under-20 titles in each of the past two years. — Tom Schad\n\nGabby Thomas wins gold, Brittany Brown bronze for USA in women's 200\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The gold medal in the women’s 200 is coming back to the U.S.\n\nGabby Thomas took an early lead around the curve and had a comfortable advantage after 100 meters. Thomas sprinted toward the finish line down the home stretch and crossed the line in 21.83, a few meters ahead of everyone else. She was the only sprinter to run a sub-22 in the race.\n\nSaint Lucia’s Julien Alfred, the gold medalist in the 100, took the silver medal at 22.08 and Team USA’s Brittany Brown got bronze, running a 22.20.\n\nAmerican McKenzie Long finished seventh at 22.42.\n\nThomas is the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in the 200 since Allyson Felix won gold at the 2012 London Games. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBahrain runner wins women's steeplechase in Olympic record time\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Bahrain’s Winfred Yavi won an exciting 3,000-meter steeplechase.\n\nYavi jumped over the final barrier, ran past Uganda’s Peruth Chemutai and crossed the finish line with an Olympic record time of 8:52.76. Chemutai took second, running a 8:53.34 and Kenya’s Faith Cherotich finished third at 8:55.15.\n\nYavi danced and celebrated around the track after her gold-medal win.\n\nAmericans Courtney Wayment and Valerie Constien finished 12th and 15th, respectively. — Tyler Dragon\n\nUSA defeats Hungary to reach women's water polo semifinals\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA women’s water polo defeated Hungary, 5-4, in the last quarterfinal match on Tuesday to keep its Olympic run alive. Playing for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal, the Americans won to advance to the semifinals match against Australia, which topped Greece, 9-6, earlier in the day.\n\nIn a hard-fought contest, the two teams were fairly even throughout the match, and Team USA had a 3-2 lead after two quarters. Tied at 4-4 midway through the fourth quarter, a goal from Rachel Fattal delivered the go-ahead score and ultimately sealed the victory for the Americans.\n\nTeam USA’s captain Maggie Steffens led the team with two goals, and goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson made 17 saves on 21 shots on the day at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nThe other semifinal match features Spain, which topped Canada, against Netherlands, which beat Italy in the quarterfinals Tuesday. Team USA and Australia are set to face off at 8:35 a.m. ET, while Spain and Netherlands will play the second semifinal at 1:35 p.m. ET. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nBrazil takes 2-0 lead over Spain in women's soccer semifinal\n\nIrene Parades gave Brazil an early 1-0 lead over Spain in the second semifinal of women's soccer. Paredes scored in the 15th minute with Brazil controlling the attack in the early minutes. Then, in the waning minutes of the first half, Brazilian striker Gabi Portilho buried a shot from the center of the box to the bottom right corner of the net to make it 2-0.\n\nThe winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match, Saturday in Paris.\n\nUSA's Annette Nneka Echikunwoke wins silver in women's hammer\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — American Annette Nneka Echikunwoke is an Olympic medalist.\n\nThe 28-year-old, whose previous best finish at a world championship with 12th, had her greatest day of 2024, throwing a season-best 75.48 meters (247 feet, 7¾ inches) to earn the silver medal in the women's hammer throw at the Paris Games.\n\nEchikunwoke’s silver gives the Americans medals in each of the throwing events so far, after Ryan Crouser won men’s shot put for the third consecutive Olympics, and Valarie Allman won women’s discus gold for the second consecutive Games. Neither javelin final has happened yet.\n\nCanada’s Camryn Rogers, who competed at the University of California in college, won gold with a throw of 76.97 (252 feet, 6¼ inches), which she tossed on her fifth attempt. Until that heave, it looked like Echikunwoke would might win.\n\nThe bronze went to Jie Zhao of China, who threw 74.27 (243 feet, 8 inches).\n\nThe other American in the final, Deanna Price, finished 11th with a throw of 71.00 (232 feet, 11¼ inches). — Lindsay Schnell\n\nAmericans Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse take gold and bronze in men's 1,500\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Cole Hocker stunned Great Britian’s Josh Kerr and Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win the men's 1,500 in dramatic fashion.\n\nHocker was in fourth place during the final lap but had one final kick left with roughly 60 meters to go and shockingly ran by favorites Kerr and a fading Ingebrigtsen as the crowd cheered.\n\nHocker crossed the line in first and immediately threw his hands up in jubilation as the scoreboard displayed that he had run an Olympic record 3:27.65 to win gold. Hocker becomes just the fourth American to win an Olympic gold medal in the 1,500.\n\nKerr finished second in a nation record 3:27.79 and fellow American Yared Nuguse snuck in to get the bronze, running a personal-best 3:27.80. It's the first time Team USA has had two medalists in the men's 1,500 in 112 years.\n\nIngebrigtsen took a disappointing fourth place and was in disbelief at the finish. Ingebrigtsen won gold at the Tokyo Olympics and Kerr got the bronze. This year’s 1,500 was supposed to be a showdown between the two, but Hocker stole the show and set the Olympic record. — Tyler Dragon\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone leads three Americans into women's 400 hurdles final\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone looks like her usual spectacular self, and that’s bad news for everyone else.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone easily won her heat — what else is new? — in the women’s 400 hurdles semifinals Tuesday evening at Stade de France, turning in a 52.13 in a race where she barely looked like she was trying. McLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder (50.65), and heavy gold medal favorite. In this race, everyone is basically running for silver. She turned in the best semifinal time by more than fourth-tenths of a second.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has said she wants to go below 50 seconds, and given her history of world records on the biggest stages, anything seems possible in Thursday’s final. At the very least it seems like a given that McLaughlin-Levrone will set a new Olympic record, which currently sits at 51.46. She set that in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nAmerican Jasmine Jones also qualified, finishing second in her semifinal at 53.83. The third American hurdler, Anna Cockrell, also advanced to the final, using a strong kick to pull in front of Jamaica’s Shiann Salmon. Cockrell finished in 52.90. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nUSWNT beats Germany to reach soccer's gold medal match\n\nLYON, France — The United States women’s national soccer team defeated Germany, 1-0, in the semifinals on Tuesday to advance to the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSophia Smith scored a goal in overtime, assisted by Mallory Swanson, to keep the Americans’ chances of winning their first gold since 2012 alive. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made an incredible save with her foot deep into extra time to keep Germany off the board.\n\nThe USWNT will face the winner of Spain vs. Brazil, which kicks off at 3 p.m. ET, on Saturday in Paris. — Nancy Armour\n\nFrance lineup change pays off vs. Canada in men’s basketball quarterfinal\n\nPARIS – French coach Vincent Collet made a massive lineup change ahead of France’s quarterfinal game against Canada, a game in which the loser was knocked out without a chance to medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Collet benched Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier, who each started the three games in group play, and the jolt worked.\n\nFrance advanced to the semifinals with an 82-73 victory against Canada Tuesday at Bercy Arena. It will play Germany Thursday for a spot in the gold-medal game.\n\nFrank Ntilikina, Nic Batum, Isaia Cordinier, Victor Wembanyama and Guerschon Yabusele started for France, which took an early 19-5 lead. The defense forced Canada to miss 10 of its first 12 shots and commit five turnovers.\n\nYabusele scored 22 points, Cordinier scored 20 and Fournier added 15, and Gobert logged just four minutes.\n\nFrance phenom Victor Wembanyama did not have a great offensive game (just seven points on 2-for-10 shooting), but he had 12 rebounds, five assists, three steals and one block and kept Canada’s guards from scoring at will in the paint.\n\nCanada shot 38% from the field, 24% on 3-pointers and put France on the line 42 times. France outscored Canada 33-18 from the free throw line. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led Canada with 27 points, and RJ Barrett had 16 points. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nU.S. women's volleyball team sweeps Poland to reach semifinals\n\nThe United States women's volleyball team made short work of Tuesday's quarterfinal, sweeping Poland 25-22, 25-14, 25-20 to move into Thursday's semifinal against powerhouse Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilians haven't dropped a set in four matches in these Olympics. They swept the Dominican Republic in a quarterfinal earlier Tuesday.\n\nAgainst Poland, the U.S. rolled through the first two sets in a total of only 45 minutes of playing time. The Americans then overcame a 7-1 deficit to start the third set, rallying to take the lead at 15-14 and eventually close out the match to advance within one victory of another Olympic medal.\n\nThe U.S. has earned a medal in women's volleyball in each of the past four Olympics, including a gold in Tokyo. Brazil beat Team USA for gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, while the Americans won the final match against Brazil in 2021.\n\nIn pool play in 2024, the Americans lost their first match of the Olympics against China but rebounded to edge Serbia 3-2 in a critical second match. From there, the U.S. hasn't lost a set, sweeping host France and Poland. — Gentry Estes\n\nUSA women's soccer vs. Germany: Sophia Smith breaks through with extra time goal\n\nIt took extra time, but Sophia Smith netted the first goal in the USA vs. Germany women's soccer tilt on Tuesday, giving the USWNT the 1-0 lead in the 95th minute.\n\nAll three Americans qualify for 400 final\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Hall looks ready for the 400 final.\n\nHall raced around the track and had a clear lead ahead of all the other sprinters at the 300-meter mark.

His season-best of 43.80 is the second fastest time in the world this year.\n\nGrenada’s Kirani James ran a season-best 43.78 to win the second heat. While U.S. sprinter Christopher Bailey finished third, running a 44.31. Bailey’s time was good enough to advance to Wednesday’s final.\n\nIn the third and final semifinal heat, Great Britian’s Matthew Hudson-Smith took his foot off the gas with 20 meters remaining and coasted to a 44.07 to win. Hudson-Smith has the fastest time in the world this year (43.74).\n\nMichael Norman finished second in the heat (44.26) to secure the other automatic qualifying spot.\n\nThe top two in each heat, plus the next two fastest times advanced to the 400 final.\n\nOlympic wrestling: American Sarah Hildebrandt heads to gold medal match\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, Sarah Hildebrandt tasted Olympic glory. Now, she has an opportunity to make it sweeter.\n\nHildebrandt, the reigning Olympic 50kg bronze medalist in women's wrestling, will grapple in the final on Wednesday.

Instead, the American women will have to wait until the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nWettstein ended up sixth in the eight-person final after finishing the preliminaries second overall. Her score of 88.12, which came on her first run, wasn’t enough in a finals in which the women threw down. Wettstein fell in the second and third rounds.\n\nAustralia’s Arisa Trew, 14, took gold; she entered Paris as the No. 2 park rider in the world. No. 1-ranked and defending silver medalist Hiraki Cocona, who will turn 16 later this month, of Japan repeated with silver.\n\nGreat Britain’s Sky Brown, who at 13 years old won bronze in Tokyo three years prior, took bronze again.\n\nTrew took the lead in the final round with a splendid 45 seconds of skating. The judges rewarded her with a 93.18 to move into first. Hiraki’s final run bumped her ahead of Brown but she could not leapfrog Trew. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA basketball TV schedule\n\nStart time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nUSA Network is airing the game, Peacock is live streaming it.\n\nUSWNT lineup today\n\nGoalkeeper: Alyssa Naeher\n\nAlyssa Naeher Defenders: Crystal Dunn, Tierna Davidson, Naomi Girma, Emily Fox\n\nCrystal Dunn, Tierna Davidson, Naomi Girma, Emily Fox Midfielders: Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Sam Coffey\n\nRose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Sam Coffey Forwards: Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson, Sophia Smith\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

But before the score even showed up on the video board at Place de Concorde on Wednesday, the 20-year-old pumped both of her arms through the air.\n\nThe score placed her in second place entering finals, which took place later in the day.\n\nWettstein fell early in her first run and posted a 75.22 in the second, which would have left her on the cusp of making finals.

Reider also coaches Italian Olympian Marcell Jacobs and American Trayvon Bromell.\n\nThree lawsuits have been filed in Broward County, Florida against Reider and the track club he runs, among a list of other defendants.\n\nThe first complaint, which was filed in December 2023, lists the plaintiff as Jane Doe and includes an allegation of rape. The other two cases were filed in June by a 35-year-old retired long jumper from Great Britain and a 28-year-old American sprinter, who allege that Reider sexually harassed them by grabbing their buttocks or making suggestive comments about their appearances, among other claims.\n\nUSA TODAY does not identify individuals who allege sexual abuse without their permission.

Unfortunately, our rooftop bar was indeed fully booked and the only unoccupied tables you saw belonged to our gourmet restaurant, L’Oiseau Blanc, which was fully reserved.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly what happened, though as is usually the case in incidents of this nature, people on both sides have weighed in. − David Oliver\n\nAmericans go head-to-head in sport climbing\n\nLE BOURGET, France — Due to their time seeding, two American speed climbers had to go head-to-head in the first elimination run of speed qualifications at sport climbing.\n\nAmerican Sam Watson set a new world record time 4.75 seconds, a record he held and lost a few runs earlier in seeing to Indonesia’s Veddriq Leonardo. “Taking (the world record) back after I lost it by a couple thousandth of a second definitely means a lot,” said Watson after the competition.\n\nAmerican teammate Zach Hammer was eliminated.\n\nOnly seven climbers who won their elimination heats and one lucky loser with the fastest time advanced to the quarterfinals on Thursday, Aug. 8. − Sandy Hooper\n\nDay two of six has begun for wrestling at the Olympics early Tuesday.\n\nTeam USA has already at least secured a silver medal from Amit Elor at 68 kilograms, after she outscored her opponents 28-2 to reach the gold medal match against Meerim Zhumanazarova (Kyrgyzstan), a bronze medalist at Tokyo.\n\nAlongside her on day two for Team USA is Sarah Hildebrandt (women's freestyle, 50 kilograms), Josef Rau (men's Greco-Roman, 97 kilograms) and Kamal Bey (men's Greco-Roman, 77 kilograms).

Name the form of it: 5x5, 3x3, Streetball, Slamball, HORSE. Doesn’t matter. We have the deepest pool of talent in the world to draw from. We’re supposed to win. We don’t celebrate bronze medals around here, and if this were a sport USA Basketball were actually serious about, everyone involved in the men’s 2-5 showing in Paris (after not even qualifying for Tokyo) would be fired.\n\nBut I’m here to tell you something after watching it up close in Paris: The effort isn’t worth it. — Dan Wolken\n\nOlympic skateboarding today: What to watch\n\nIn the women’s park event, expect to see a battle of teenage stars. At the Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021 due to COVID, Kokona Hiraki made history at age 12 as Japan’s youngest Summer Olympian. She won silver in women’s park behind her teammate Sakura Yosozumi.

He pulled a purple LSU hat out from under the table.\n\n\"LSU felt like home from the start,\" said Jones.\n\nMinutes later, Dean reached for a Jordan Brand shoe box and set it on the table with a heavy thud. Then he held up a red, throwback, Georgia Bulldogs long-sleeve T-shirt.\n\n\"I just had to make a decision for me and my family that would put me at peace and I asked God, and he led me to UGA,\" said Dean.\n\nDean, the top-ranked inside linebacker in the country and the No. 14 overall prospect according to the 247Sports composite rankings, said that he and Jones discussed playing together in college. Jones played quarterback for Horn Lake, but was recruited as a defensive back.\n\n\"We always told each other that we were going to do what's best for us first, and if playing with each other was best we would do it, but if not we'd still love each other like brothers,\" said Dean.\n\nDean picked the the Bulldogs over Alabama, Auburn, LSU, Texas A&M and several other Power-5 offers. He plans to enroll in January.\n\nThis year's Bulldogs recruiting class is ranked No. 2 in the nation behind Alabama, according to 247Sports. Dean is the fourth five-star prospect to sign with Georgia. Christian Brothers defensive end Bill Norton, the No. 2 prospect in Tennessee, also signed with Georgia Wednesday.\n\nCoach Brad Boyette said that it was a proud day, capping an historic season for Horn Lake.\n\n\"I mean we’ve had players sign before, but a player of Nakobe’s stature and the things that Raydarious has done, to have two going to some of the best places to play college football in the country is a good day for Horn Lake High School.\"\n\nThe 6-foot, 220 pound Dean had 175 tackles, seven sacks, three interceptions and two forced fumbles.\n\nHis efforts earned him the High School Butkus Award, which is given annually to the top high school linebacker in the country. Dean also was named the Gatorade Mississippi Player of the Year and the MHSAA 6A Mr. Football.\n\nJones threw for 175 yards and rushed for 83 yards in the state title game, earning MVP honors. He also was named to the All-State first team.\n\nMore Nakobe Dean coverage:\n\nFeature:Horn Lake's Nakobe Dean, nation's top inside linebacker recruit, has 'purpose for every second'\n\nButkus Award:Horn Lake football star Nakobe Dean wins High School Butkus Award as nation's top linebacker\n\nAll-State:Horn Lake football coach Brad Boyette, LB Nakobe Dean get all-state honors", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2024/09/07/college-football-week-2-winners-losers-michigan-texas/75123922007/", "title": "College football Week 2 winners and losers: Michigan, Texas lead way", "text": "Michigan never stood a chance.\n\nNo. 3 Texas sailed to a 31-12 win against the No. 9 Wolverines behind 246 yards and three touchdowns from quarterback Quinn Ewers, simultaneously flashing the Longhorns' immense talent and potential while illustrating just how far the defending national champions have fallen since January.\n\nAmong the list of issues for Michigan is quarterback play. While Ewers burnished his Heisman Trophy case, former walk-on Davis Warren went 22 of 33 for 204 yards and two interceptions for the Wolverines, who have yet to crack 300 yards of offense in the first two games of this season.\n\nThat this team went into the opener with Warren is almost mindboggling given how easy it has become for programs such as Michigan to find plug-and-play quarterbacks in the transfer portal. Through two games, the senior is averaging 5.5 yards per attempt with more interceptions, three, than touchdowns. Most of his yardage Saturday came after Texas had the game in hand.\n\nThe loss snaps the program's Big Ten record of 29 regular-season wins in a row and ends what was the nation's longest active winning streak at 16 games. The last defeat for the Wolverines, against TCU in the 2022 College Football Playoff, sparked last year's historic run to perfection; this one raises some very significant questions about how far Michigan can really go in coach Sherrone Moore's first year.\n\nThe offense is already a mess bordering on a disaster, and barring any in-season adjustments or improvements stands to be a monthslong concern with do-or-die games to come against No. 14 Southern California, No. 6 Oregon and No. 3 Ohio State. It seems like a lock that current backup Alex Orji will get a chance to replace Warren, but how much difference would that make?\n\nThe Wolverines would be able to stay in the Big Ten and playoff mix with another elite defense. But Texas made this unit look underwhelming, too. The Longhorns were the first regular-season opponent to throw multiple touchdowns without an interception against Michigan since Ohio State on Nov. 27, 2021, and the first non-conference opponent to do so since Colorado on Sept. 17, 2016. Thanks in large part to freshman wide receiver Ryan Wingo's 55-yard gain, Texas also ran for 143 yards on 4.5 yards per carry with a touchdown.\n\nTexas looks like one of the best teams in the country. Michigan resembles a team and program in transition. The Longhorns and Wolverines lead the way for the biggest winners and losers of Week 2:\n\nWinners\n\nNebraska\n\nThere was never a question that Matt Rhule would win at Nebraska — the only question was how much. Beating Colorado 28-10 doesn't itself scream that the Cornhuskers are ready to make a permanent home in the USA TODAY Sports US LBM Coaches Poll; the Buffaloes are horrible and the Cornhuskers were very sloppy on offense in the second half, so it's hard to make too much of even an 18-point win. What Saturday shows is the progress from one season to the next. Last September, the Cornhuskers barely sniffed Colorado in a 36-14 loss in Boulder. A year later, this program has eclipsed the Buffaloes and left its longtime rival in the dust. In contrast to the quick-fix blueprint used by Deion Sanders that leans heavily on major roster turnover, Rhule wants to build a sustainable program that's built to last. In other words, Nebraska's program is substantially better than Colorado's today and that gap will only grow in the future.\n\nQuinn Ewers\n\nEwers has to be seen as the current Heisman favorite after his performance in Ann Arbor. It's a very deep race at this early moment: Miami's Cam Ward has been terrific, Georgia's Carson Beck continues to excel and Mississippi's Jaxson Dart is off to a torrid start, so Ewers has plenty of company near the top. Already sitting at 506 yards and six scores through two games, Ewers will stay in the national spotlight thanks to games against No. 13 Oklahoma (Oct. 12) and No. 1 Georgia (Oct. 19).\n\nTennessee\n\nIf things were fair, dismantling No. 23 North Carolina State 51-10 on a neutral field in Charlotte, North Carolina, should thrust No. 12 Tennessee into the top 10. Where the team falls in Sunday's new Top 25 is less important than the idea that doing such a number on one of the best in the ACC shows that the Volunteers deserve to be included among the elite teams in the FBS. Josh Heupel's team are rolling early behind new quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who had 211 passing yards, 65 rushing yards and three combined scores against the Wolfpack and continues to look like one of the most promising young players in the sport. But it was the defense that delivered on Saturday, limiting the Wolfpack to just 143 yards and 1.4 yards per carry. After taking a slight step back to nine wins last season, Tennessee has a chance at putting together a special season.\n\nKansas State\n\nThe No. 16 Wildcats were able to escape with a 34-27 win at Tulane after the defense stepped up in the fourth quarter, breaking the 27-27 tie with a 60-yard fumble return for a touchdown with eight minutes to go and then intercepting the Green Wave in the end zone to seal the victory with 12 seconds left. This is not a win to overlook because of Tulane's place in the Group of Five: Down the line, Kansas State should earn credit from the playoff selection committee for a solid road win. Running back DJ Giddens had 114 yards on the ground and a team-best 63 yards receiving while safety VJ Payne had seven tackles, one for loss, and the game-clinching interception.\n\nSyracuse\n\nThe Orange moved to 2-0 under rookie coach Fran Brown after a 31-28 win against Georgia Tech keyed by Ohio State transfer Kyle McCord's 381 passing yards and four touchdowns. McCord, who had 24 touchdowns for the Buckeyes last season but left after being told he'd have to compete for the starting job, now has tossed eight scores through two games. The win itself keeps Syracuse on track for a third bowl game in a row — that would make Brown the third new coach to reach the postseason in school history — but there's a question of what beating the Yellow Jackets actually means. Tech had made an early reputation on beating Florida State in Week 0, but that victory has lust some luster after the Seminoles lost big on Labor Day to Boston College.\n\nLosers\n\nDeion Sanders\n\nAt some point, you've got to look past all the hoopla to see the program that's actually being constructed at Colorado. After another offseason chocked with roster moves, the Buffaloes still can't block, have no running game, can't protect, can't get after the passer and are so poor defensively that keeping Nebraska off the board in the second half feels like a victory. The loss drops Sanders to 5-9 overall and just 3-9 against the Power Five, with no real reason to think that a switch can be flipped that will turn the Buffaloes into a competent group before taking on the Big 12. In fact, the Buffaloes' schedule features five teams ranked in this week's Top 25, so it can and maybe will get even worse.\n\nNotre Dame\n\nNorthern Illinois 16, No. 7 Notre Dame 14. Given last week's confidence-boosting win at Texas A&M and the rolling hype train that had already painted the Fighting Irish as almost a lock for the playoff, this debacle qualifies as one of the worst losses in program history. Start with the postseason impact: Notre Dame has a weaker-than-usual schedule and now has to run the table to ensure a playoff berth. There's also the intense pressure on coach Marcus Freeman, who has now suffered losses to Marshall and the Huskies at home during his three-plus seasons. Again and again under Freeman, the Irish have played down to their competition; this time, doing so could very well cost Notre Dame a shot at playing for the national championship.\n\nHugh Freeze\n\nGiven what he took over, Freeze deserved a mulligan for last year's 6-7 finish. We'll see if that same understanding continues in 2024 after Auburn's 21-14 loss at home to new ACC member California, which kicked things off last week with an underwhelming 31-13 win against UC Davis. So how do the Tigers lose at home to a team picked to finish 10th in the ACC? Well, those five turnovers didn't help. Four came via interceptions by quarterback Payton Thorne, who has tossed at least one pick in each of his five games against the Power Four. Does Freeze need to make a change to get Auburn back into a bowl?\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas' latest dumb, idiotic, boneheaded loss spells major trouble for embattled head coach Sam Pittman. Ahead 21-7 at halftime against No. 17 Oklahoma State — the Cowboys' points coming via a pick-six in the second quarter — the Razorbacks gave things away in the second half and fell 39-31 in double overtime. The loss is even more difficult to comprehend when you look at the box score: Arkansas gained 648 yards of offense and 33 first downs but was crippled by three turnovers and two missed field goals. Given what's ahead in SEC play, this was a game the program had to have to reach bowl eligibility; falling short of six wins would ensure that this year is Pittman's last.\n\nCincinnati\n\nAnother coach headed toward dire straits is Cincinnati's Scott Satterfield, who went 3-9 in debut last season and now has the Bearcats at 1-1 after a fourth-quarter meltdown against Pittsburgh. Up 27-6 with just under five minutes to go in the third quarter, UC gave up three touchdowns — the Panthers missed the ensuing two-point try on each score — and a field goal down the stretch to lose 28-27 and fall to 2-7 at home in Satterfield's brief tenure. His predecessor, Luke Fickell, went 41-10 at home from 2015-22.\n\nKent State\n\nThere should be no doubt over which team is the worst in the FBS. Already slotted in at No. 134 in the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-134, Kent State will be locked into last place until further notice after losing 23-17 to Saint Francis of the Championship Subdivision. Owners of just one winning season since 2017, Saint Francis is far from an FCS powerhouse. But the Red Flash were too much for the Golden Flashes, losers of 13 of 14 under second-year coach Kenni Burnes.\n\nAlabama-Birmingham\n\nThere was something poetic about a 32-6 loss to Louisiana-Monroe and coach Bryant Vincent, who spent several years as Bill Clark's offensive coordinator at UAB and went 7-6 as the interim coach in 2022 but was passed over for the permanent position in favor of former NFL quarterback, TV pundit and high school coach Trent Dilfer. Well, that's been an ugly mess: Dilfer is now 5-9 with the Blazers after inheriting a program coming off five winning seasons in a row. Dilfer's lack of experience before taking over the program has threatened to undo all the progress UAB made after being reinstated as a program in 2017.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/2024/02/09/texas-longhorns-nfl-mock-draft-byron-murphy-tvondre-sweat-sec-big-ten-dartmouth-union-basketball/72456572007/", "title": "Texas football may be on the verge of becoming the newest NFL ...", "text": "Defensive tackle Byron Murphy II could be the first Longhorn player taken in this spring's NFL draft but one of six in the first two rounds.\n\nThe SEC and Big Ten are the big boys in college athletics but they should think big and not overlook the small programs.\n\nTexas has won two of the last three Directors' Cup as the nation's best athletic department and currently sit No. 3 after the fall competition.\n\nWhile I got ya, here are nine things and one crazy prediction:\n\nYeah, I think Texas is ready for the SEC\n\n1. A super draft for Texas: You think the Texas football team was lights out in 2023? The NFL may soon agree with you. ESPN draft analyst Matt Miller wrote this week that the Longhorns would have no fewer than six Longhorns taken in the first two rounds. Six! And I’m right there with him. He pegs defensive tackle Byron Murphy II as the first Longhorn off the board by Seattle’s Seahawks at No. 16, saying his “ceiling is incredibly high, and he’d be awesome in new head coach Mike Macdonald’s defense.” He has wideout Xavier Worthy going with the last pick of the opening round to Kansas City, which I think should take him for his speed — “maybe the fastest player in this draft class” — or Adonai Mitchell for his hands, routes and money plays with 11 touchdowns and 41 first-down catches in one season. (Miller projects Mitchell to the Titans at No. 38.). Since the Bengals don’t have a single tight end under contract, Miller has Ja’Tavion Sanders going to Cincinnati at No. 49. The “immovable” nose tackle T’Vondre Sweat will take his game to Cleveland at No. 54, Miller thinks, and even with his torn ACL, running back Jonathon Brooks is penciled in for the Packers at 58th. … Six players in 58 picks is damn impressive. No other program had more in this mock draft. College Football Playoff teams Washington and Alabama each had five projected in the first two rounds while national champion Michigan and Georgia each had four. Just think, if Quinn Ewers had come out, he too might have gone that high to put seven Longhorns in that hierarchy. So would sophomore offensive tackle Kelvin Banks Jr. and perhaps linebacker Anthony Hill, if they were eligible. Yes, I’d say Texas is SEC-ready.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2020/03/12/list-of-sports-events-affected-by-the-new-coronavirus/111417460/", "title": "List of sports events affected by the coronavirus pandemic"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/10/13/football-four-played-in-played-out-missouri-wisconsin-oklahoma-florida/2974987/", "title": "Played In/Played Out: Promising turn for Mizzou, Wisconsin", "text": "Paul Myerberg\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nUSA TODAY Sports is keeping one eye on the final year of the Bowl Championship Series and another on the 2014 season, when the Football Bowl Subdivision implements four-team playoff. If the season ended today, here are three teams moving into the championship picture and three moving out.\n\nTeams playing their way in:\n\nMissouri. With a single win, Missouri vaults to the top of the SEC East Division and moves its way into the national championship conversation. This was no ordinary win, of course: Missouri went into Georgia and knocked off the No. 7 Bulldogs, earning its sixth win – passing last year's win total – and making a case for a sport among the top 15 teams in the country. Can the Tigers remain among the nation's elite? Remember that this isn't necessarily rarified air for Missouri, which won 48 games from 2007-11 before injuries led to a stumbling SEC debut last fall. A bigger issue is again injuries, as quarterback James Franklin could miss the remainder of the regular season with a shoulder injury. The Tigers will have to move forward against divisional foes South Carolina and Florida with backup quarterback Maty Mauk, who replaced Franklin in Saturday's fourth quarter.\n\nWisconsin. The Badgers might be on the outside looking in when it comes to the Big Ten title, thanks to a loss to divisional rival Ohio State, but the Rose Bowl remains a possibility – with two caveats. One, Wisconsin would need OSU to run the table, finish 13-0 and earn a spot in the BCS National Championship Game. That would then allow the Big Ten to send a second team to the BCS with an at-large bid. Two, Wisconsin would need to go 10-2 during the regular season and have the winner of the Legends Division lose at least two games during the regular season. Doable, right? After beating Northwestern 35-6, there's little doubt that Wisconsin is the second-best team in the Big Ten.\n\nNo. 21 Texas Tech. It hasn't always been pretty, but the Red Raiders head out of the second Saturday of October at 6-0, undefeated at the midway point for the first time since 2008, and one of two Big 12 teams, joining Baylor, to be perfect in conference play. It's been an auspicious debut for coach Kliff Kingsbury, who has succeeded in remaking Tech's offense – as most expected he would – and rebuilding a program's ragged sense of self-confidence. While the Raiders haven't yet tried their hand against a premier Big 12 opponent , that opportunity is coming: Tech gets Baylor, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State during a four-week span in October and November.\n\nTeams playing their way out:\n\nNo. 10 Oklahoma. The opportunity was there for Oklahoma to put its foot down against Texas, dropping the Longhorns out of the Big 12 hunt while remaining among the undefeated teams in the FBS. Then there was the draw – last but not least – of handing Texas and coach Mack Brown a fourth loss in a row in the Red River Rivalry, extending the program's second-longest series streak under coach Bob Stoops. Think the opposite: OU stumbled, losing for the first time in 2013, and saw its spot among the Big 12's leaders go to rival Texas. While Texas lost to Brigham Young and Mississippi during non-conference play, it stands above OU in the chase for the Fiesta Bowl as the two old-schools rival reach the midway point.\n\nNo. 16 Michigan. The Wolverines had flirted with disaster before, notably against Akron and Connecticut, and seemed destined for at least one or two losses during the regular season. That Michigan's first loss came at Penn State seems particularly painful, since the Wolverines' schedule features far stiffer tests: Ohio State, for one, but also divisional games still to come against Michigan State, Nebraska and Northwestern. At this point, based on Michigan's performance through the midway point, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where the Wolverines can run the table through the Big Ten title game. But given the sloppy play on offense, the sputtering defense and cautious play-calling, can UM match last year's eight-win total during the regular season?\n\nNo. 17 Florida. Like Georgia, the Gators enter the second half of 2013 with a non-conference loss – in Florida's case, to Miami (Fla.) – and one loss during SEC play. And like the Bulldogs, UF's two losses essentially doom its chances of doing anything more than earning the SEC's at-large BCS bid, should that spot not go automatically to the second-place team in the SEC West Division. (This assumes a team like Florida doesn't beat a team like Alabama in the SEC title game, which seems like a safe assumption.) So Florida enters the second half playing for the SEC East, and can take confidence in the fact that it controls its own destiny. Unlike Georgia, Missouri and South Carolina, the Gators have yet to play any other East contender. So with the Bulldogs, Tigers and Gamecocks to come, the Gators just need to take care of business.\n\nPaul Myerberg, a national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports, is on Twitter @PaulMyerberg.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/13"}]}

They don’t nibble, gnaw, or suck in their prey. Better words would be crash, destroy, or annihilate.\n\nSometimes if a kingfish is coming up from the depths to attack a hapless baitfish swimming peacefully on the surface it will actually break the surface and shoot many feet into the air with a terrified pilchard in its toothy jaws of death.\n\nThis is called skyrocketing, or skying.\n\nThere’s nothing an angler can do until the king is back in the water and running away, at which time the hook can be set. Sometimes you get a hookup.\n\nSometimes you get just half a baitfish back. I hate to get the front half back. It always looks so frightened.\n\nKingfish have sharp teeth designed to slice and cut. You must use a wire leader, or at least 80-pound-test fluorocarbon. No. 5 or 7 browntone wire works best for me.\n\nA foot to 18 inches will do. Also, use a black swivel to attach your line to the leader. This will prevent the fish from twisting and kinking off the leader. Hooks vary from circle, to J-style, to treble.\n\nSome anglers add a “stinger” or free-swinging hook on a short length of leader to the eye of the main hook. The idea is to snag the king when it strikes. They work, but at the expense of tiring out the live bait.\n\nSpeaking of bait, live isn’t the only way to go. A drifted Spanish sardine or ballyhoo with three J-hooks strung tip-to-eye makes for a rig that seldom gets a short-strike. This is the rig also used drift a strip bait. A large live shrimp will take kings too.\n\nLarge swimming plugs will draw strikes from king mackerel, but they are frequently destroyed by the fish.\n\nTo counter that, use a large metal spoon. One of my favorites is a Pet spoon in Size 18 . The trick is to get it down into the water column about 10 feet. Down-riggers and trolling weights will do it.\n\nNow for a little science. When sunlight penetrates saltwater, colors change. Because of this you should pull a red spoon from daylight to about 10 a.m., then switch to blue.\n\nAt about 4 p.m. put on a gold spoon. It all has to do with underwater visibility at different times of day, and what the fish see. If you can only troll with one color, go with gold.\n\nDon’t have a boat to chase kingfish? Don’t worry .\n\nPlenty of kingfish are available from Gulf and Atlantic fishing piers. Some of the best and closest to us are in Panama City Beach, Navarre Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Ormond Beach.\n\nTechniques are somewhat different from a pier. Longer rods are needed to cast out to where the fish might be.\n\nLive baits should be hooked through the nose or underneath and either anchored to the bottom with a 4- to 6-ounce weight, or attached to some sort of float. If you use a small balloon, tie it securely to the swivel so it doesn’t drift off when a fish strikes. Sometimes if the wind is blowing from the land to the water you can drift a live bait pretty far out.\n\nBut beware of any boats in the area. They could easily cross your line and cut it when fighting a fish.\n\nA method that works extremely well is called “snobbling” where a dead cigar minnow or goggleye is hooked through the nose, cast out, allowed to sink a bit, then twitched back to simulate an injured fish. It’s deadly.\n\nSpoons for pier use are limited. A 2 1/2-ounce silver Krocodile spoon works best. Cast it as far out as possible, let it sink all the way to the bottom, reel it in steadily as fast as you can (no jerking) and hang on. The strike will be sudden.\n\nChill kingfish as soon as they are caught. Unfortunately they are a long fish and won’t fit in most coolers and fish boxes, and you can’t cut them to fit.\n\nKingfish must be kept whole until landed ashore.\n\nThe solution is a soft-sided kingfish bag. Gut the fish, slip it in the bag and add ice. Or you can make your own bag with bubble wrap and binder clips.\n\nKingfish are usually filleted or cut into steaks. Their raw flesh is grayish, due to its high fat content.\n\nBest prepared by broiling, grilling, baking or, especially for large “smoker” king ... by smoking. They taste like all the mackerels.\n\nThere is some concern about eating kingfish. Tests indicate high levels of mercury in the bigger fish. Guidelines call for limited consumption for normal adults, and none for small children and pregnant women.\n\nBut other studies show that free-occurring selenium in sea water bonds with the mercury and renders it harmless. Someday scientists will get their act together and come to an agreement.\n\nAll I know is that I ate kingfish once or twice a week while I was growing up with no ill effects ... except for the third ear growing out of the top of my head.\n\nThe limit on kingfish (king mackerel) in Gulf state waters (up to nine miles out) and federal waters is three per day per person, and they must be at least 24 inches long from the tip of the nose to the fork of the tail.\n\nAlso, the fish must remain whole, heads and tails intact (you may gut them) until landed ashore. This is so wildlife officials can determine the species and length of your catch.\n\nCatch them while you can. Come winter the fish will be gone.\n\nFISHING REPORT\n\nSaltwater\n\nSt. George Island\n\nCaptain Russ Knapp on St. George Island (knappsgi@hotmail.com) said: “Captain Randy Peart is finding lots of white trout on the edges of the flats. Capt. Randy says use a 1/8-ounce jig head with a Gulp! shrimp.\n\n“The Bob Sykes Cut is holding some flounder and reds. Shrimp or greenbacks will work the best. Off the beach look for nice whiting just past the surf break. Small piece of shrimp or Fishbite should do the trick.”\n\n“Offshore, Capt. Clint Taylor is fishing live bottom 20 plus miles out and catching good numbers of mangrove and red snapper, with some gag grouper mixed in. Live bait is working the best, and be sure to bring a lot of chum.\n\n“Capt. Clint reports the pelagics are here in force, so bring trolling gear and head for the deep water for black fin tuna, wahoo, and mahi. If you’re looking for kings they are everywhere and can be caught as close as three miles.”\n\nCaptain David Avant III on St. George Island (davidavant@aol.com; 850-228-6234) said: “The trout bite is there but you better get out early, as in before 7 a.m. or the skinny-water sport is over, then try deeper bars behind the islands. Live bait or fresh shrimp fished on the bottom in 8 feet and deeper water should produce trout, but you’ll have to move around.\n\n“I talked to a man fishing the old St. George fishing bridge. He had had good luck at night fishing for flounder and trout using live greenback minnows. If you have a boat fish the bayside docks at night. The lighted ones have more action, but all of them are good places to toss a Cajun Thunder Float over a live pinfish.\n\n“I particularly like the last four docks before Bob Sykes Cut. Because they’re lighted and in a prime location close to the cut. Shark fishing has also been good at night outside of Bob Sykes Cut on the outgoing tide.\n\n“Capt. Allan Richards, aka Wooduck, has been filling limits of trout and reds but it’s been tough, he said due to low salinity, dirty water, and lack of bait.\n\n“Some anglers fishing the beach off the second sandbar in 10-12 feet of water on the incoming tide reported a few trout, but they had been legal sized at least.\n\n“Scallops at St. Mark’s were spotty and in deeper water. I saw only two boats out in Lanark today. I expect they found a few.”\n\nApalachee Bay\n\nOtto Hough at Myhometownfishing.com (otto@myhometownfishing.com) said: “Boy, oh boy, this last weekend and first of the week was sweltering hot and humid over the Big Bend waters, but anglers were finding fish early to avoid the sauna-like conditions. The trout have moved towards the coolest waters they can find, mainly in waters 6-9 feet in depth. Outside the ‘party’ sandbar east of the St. Marks Birdrack, the trout have been hanging on the southern side, in depths of 6 feet or so out to about 9 or so feet.\n\n“They seem to be liking the shrimp imitation soft baits like the 1/2 ounce D.O.A. and Live Target versions, though a quarter-ounce jig head tipped with a Gulp!, Saltwater Assassin or Z-Man shrimp with a tad of sweetner like ProCure shrimp has been producing well too. Some really fine trout have made the journey outside to lurk in the fringes of the Ochlocknee Shoals over the spotty bottom holes.\n\n“Going into this three-day stretch, it looks to be another of those typical summertime fishing patterns sandwiched between the moons. High tides out of St. Marks will be happening a couple of hours or so after sunrise. There’s always hope to find some trout and reds in close early on the rising tides, but once that sun gets up by midmorning it’s time to beat a track to deeper waters for the trout. The deeper creek holes have been holding the reds.\n\n“Along the St. Marks Refuge buoy line, the Spanish mackerel continue to prowl. Over on the flat outside Long Bar at Shell Point, the tarpon have been roaming, gulping and providing a number of anglers targeting that species with some exhilarating excitement.\n\n“Outside, the highly ‘endangered’ (by Fed standards) red snapper was definitely in danger this past weekend, as just about every angler targeting ’em found ’em chomping. Lots of awesome fish in the 20 to 25 pound class came home to become some fine dining fare for many an angler’s family.\n\n“The gags were not to be left out of the mix either, as they too were chomping on live bait offerings in both State and Federal waters Saturday, but only Fed waters once the clock struck midnight June 30th.\n\n“The four-county area in State waters has closed, but will reopen Sept. 1.\n\n“So, for now it’s a good poke out the nine-mile Federal waters. More than worth it if some quality gags are desired, though the limit is two per angler. Slow trolling the MirrOlure MR113 and Stretch 25 over live bottom is producing too. Kings have begun to wreak havoc on the baitfish pods southeast of Ochlocknee Shoals and around Marker 24. Free lining or slow trolling a frisky pinfish near one of the baitfish pods will garner attention.\n\n“When on the Big Pond this time of year, remember to stay hydrated. It doesn’t take much time in the sweltering heat and humidity this time of year to sweat out gallons leading to heat exhaustion complications. Have plenty of water, Powerade or Gatorade iced down on board. Especially important, make certain the young anglers on board keep drinking lots of liquids. Plus, boat safely and wisely as the summertime conditions bring out the crowds to enjoy the Gulf waters.”\n\nCapt. Dave Lear of Tallahassee said: “Hot temperatures have forced fish into summer patterns to minimize the heat. Early, late and deep is the current mantra to find trout. Reds don’t mind the hot water nearly as much, but when fishing a mixed bag it pays to max out chances.\n\n“Depths up to eight feet are the most consistent lately. Soft-plastic jigs and shrimp lures like the DOA 1/2-ounce or Sureketch touts on a heavier jig head are scoring trout, although it requires picking through undersize specks.\n\n“A split shiner tail (pinfish) under a cork is another summer favorite. It might also entice a passing cobia, tarpon or shark too. Early in the shallows calls for topwater plugs like Rapala Skitter Walks, Heddon Spooks or Storm Chug Bugs.\n\n“Floating grass continues to be a problem for treble hooks, however. As an alternate, the new DOA PT soft plugs with their weedless hooks and rattle will snake right through the stringy salad.”\n\n“Surface and slow-sinking twitch baits will fool redfish, although it’s hard to beat a weedless gold or pink Aquadream or Capt. Mike’s 3/8-ounce spoon. Work them slowly so they flutter just off the bottom and cast over oysters bars, around rock grass patches or flooded shorelines. If the reds are there, you’ll know it quick.”\n\n“There are plenty of big adversaries if you’re so inclined. Medium-heavy tackle is necessary for cobia, tarpon and sharks. Try lime green, candy apple red or olive/pearl Gag’s Whip-it Eels for ling. A 1/2- or 3/4-ounce jig head gives good casting distance and the right sink rate. Tarpon are tarpon. Sometimes they’ll eat a kitchen sink and the next day they turn their big noses up at anything you throw.\n\n“Early morning is the best time to look for rollers. Cast DOA BaitBusters, MirrOlure 65M twitch baits or large poppers ahead of the travel path and hope you picked the right day. Remember, tarpon must remain in the water and a $50 tag is required to submit one for a world record. Otherwise, they are strictly catch-and-release.\n\n“Unfortunately the pre-season scallop scouting reports for the East Flats have been discouraging for bi-valve hunters. The wet spring is probably the cause. There hasn’t been any mention of scallops near Lanark, either. If you really want to go snorkeling, Keaton Beach south seems like the only early option right now. That could change as the season goes on.”\n\n“The post 4th holiday weekend outlook looks promising, albeit with the usual chance of heat-produced thunder-boomers. Decent water flow will come mid-morning with the high tide. An average solunar feeding window will sandwich that high as the moon is up.”\n\nKeaton Beach\n\nCaptain Pat McGriff of One More Cast Guide Service (www.onemorecast.net; onemorecast@gtcom.net; 850-584-9145) reported: “The recent rains and wind Monday stirred the water up and I had to back down off my areas to find new fish for my charter with the Zorns.\n\n“They managed to catch nine trout and two keeper reds. Marty Zorn had top honors with the largest red. His was 27 inches long (his first-ever red). William Zorn also had his first-ever red (23 inches) and trout (19 inches) on this trip. Marty also had the largest trout, a fine 23-inch sow. We found our fish in 4.5-5 feet of water and caught the trout and reds mixed in the same two drifts. The wind was doing about 15 knots.\n\n“We caught all our fish on live pinfish hanging 34 inches under a Back Bay Thunder. If you made a good ‘pop’ you got a hit. Essential to make a loud noise with your Thunder due to the stained water and the wind.\n\n“If the current trends hold, expect to need your Original and Back Back Bay Thunders to raise fish this weekend. Find the correct stain and you should find the bite. I saw Pete and Kay Giddens of Ocilla, Ga., and they had caught their limit of trout and reds both Saturday and Sunday. They were fishing live pinfish under Back Bay Thunders also.”\n\nSteinhatchee\n\nKristin Skipper at Sea Hag Marina in Steinhatchee (352-498-3008) sent photos of scallops, scallops, and more scallops. Fish-wise, there were several big kingfish, red snapper, gag grouper, and a large cobia.\n\nFreshwater\n\nLake Jackson\n\nOtto Hough at Myhometownfishing.com (otto@myhometownfishing.com) said: “Mother Nature over the past weekend was somewhat kind to Lakes Jackson, Carr and Iamonia by dumping numerous afternoon thunderboomers over the lakes.\n\n“Still, with all the showers the main pool at Jackson only hopped up seven inches. When looking back to this time last July at the lake level, it’s gonna take another 17 inches of new water to get the lake level up. Even then, the lake will still be sitting below normal full-pool depth.\n\n“For those anglers fishing out of kayaks, canoes, jon boats and small Gheenoes, the bass have been cooperating early morning and late afternoon. The larger jon boats and Gheenoes have finally gotten enough water to launch out of Sunset Landing and the US-27 N landings.\n\n“Most anglers with motors have been working the south end of the lake. The north end has pretty much begun to fully top out with coontail mats, leaving a goodly amount of lake for kayakers to traverse.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/06/15/things-montana/71267898/", "title": "101 things to do in Montana", "text": "Tribune Staff\n\nWhether you live in Montana and are looking for a road trip, or visiting the state from afar, we have 101 outings for you to put on your bucket list.\n\nIN AND AROUND GREAT FALLS\n\n1 River's Edge Trail\n\nAs the Missouri River \"meanders through Great Falls, sheltering waterfowl and encouraging other wildlife — and human recreation — along its banks,\" so does this nearly 60 miles of paved and graveled pathways for walking, running, skating and bicycling. A result of a cooperative partnership by the city of Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Department of Transportation, PPL Montana and the volunteer trail advocacy group, Recreational Trails Inc., it is one of the urban delights of Great Falls that blends the city with its rural surroundings. Some of its \"splashy features include Black Eagle Falls, Rainbow Falls, Crooked Falls, Ryan Falls (the \"great falls of the Missouri\") and Morony Falls, outdoor art and memorial benches and tables and picnic shelters.\n\nIn 1990, Recreational Trails Inc. formed to help forge the riverside route, which grows each year with new places and trails to explore. The paved, wheelchair-accessible trail runs along the south shore of the river, from Oddfellows Park, which is near the Warden Bridge on 10th Avenue South, past Broadwater Bay, Mitchell Pool, Gibson and Elks Riverside Parks, Black Eagle Falls, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Giant Springs Heritage State Park and Rainbow Falls to the Crooked Falls Overlook. The asphalt ends there, but the trail doesn't. A dirt trail stretches along the cliffs another three miles to Cochrane Dam.\n\nEast of Great Falls, the North Shore Trail follows along Cochrane, Ryan and Morony reservoirs. The trail begins at the end of Rainbow Dam Road and includes gravel and single track segments totaling more than 13 miles. A single-track trail now runs between Rainbow and Morony dams, and a trailhead has been established at Rainbow Dam. An expert single-track trail between Ryan and Cochrane dams provides an exceptional way to explore the river canyon east of town. Interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area have been provided by the Cascade Conservation District and the Missouri River Council, and QR Code signs along the trail make information about the trail and dams available to smartphone users.\n\nThe Montana Department of Transportation has completed the design of the Sun River Connector Trail to extend a separated bike and pedestrian connection along Country Club Blvd., between the west approach of the Warden Bridge and 6th Street Southwest, and construction will begin in 2016. This summer's improvements will include a paved loop from Heritage Park down to Giant Springs, a new trail between the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Giant Springs and the opening of a 2.1-mile loop linking the Heritage Center, Giant Springs and Heritage Park. Paving will be done to the parking area at Bay Drive, and United Materials will be redoing the shoulders along the trail from 15th Street to Giant Springs.\n\nSummer 2015 activities include Audubon West Wednesday Walks for bird watching along the river and on Sacajawea Island, Cochrane Dam crossings on July 11 and Aug. 22 and a number of \"fun runs\" and mountain bike activities. For details call 788-3313 or read more about the trails at www.thetrail.org.\n\n2 The C.M. Russell Museum\n\nVisitors from all over the world enjoy the Great Falls museum named after the famous cowboy artist who adopted Great Falls as his home more than a century ago. They also can enjoy the Russell Rider Sculpture Garden, a place \"families can come, free of charge, all four seasons\" to picnic, roam the garden and appreciate wonderful art including five major bronze pieces. Five galleries have been installed to showcase the \"astonishing depth and range\" of Russell's art, which ranged from paintings and sculpture to illustrated letters and pen-and-ink drawings during his lifetime (1864-1926). The museum has some 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects and a \"permanent collection of more than 12,000 objects\" including works of such well-known artists as O.C. Seltzer, Winold Reiss, J.H. Sharp and Frank Tenney Johnson.\n\nDon't miss \"The Bison: American Icon, Heart of the Plains Indian Culture,\" the most ambitious permanent exhibition ever displayed at the C.M. Russell Museum. With about 500 artifacts and a thundering buffalo diorama that shakes as you walk over it, the $1.5 million exhibition is a fitting subject because three-quarters of the Russell Museum's entire collection of paintings and sculpture involve Indians and bison. The \"Browning Firearms Collection\" of rifles, shotguns and handguns surveys the significant developments made by the Browning, Winchester and Colt companies. New this season is \"Harmless Hunter: The Wildlife Work of Charles M. Russell,\" runs through Sept. 13, and \"focuses for the first time on Russell's painting of wildlife.\"\n\nRight beside the museum is Russell's Log Studio, built in 1903. The artifacts in it belonged to Russell and were used for reference in his artwork. The Russell home next door was built in 1900 under the supervision of his wife, Nancy. During the summer, the museum, located at 400 13th St. N., is open Tuesday to Sunday. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the cabin studio is open 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and the home is open 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Admission is $9 for adults, $7 for seniors, retired military and schedule tour groups, $4 for students and is free for active military and kids under age 5. Call 727-8787, or visit www.cmrussell.org.\n\n3 Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center is nestled into the bluffs of the Missouri River overlooking a section of river where the famed explorers portaged two centuries ago to avoid the nearby waterfalls. Black Eagle Falls, the uppermost of the five falls, is visible from the big windows of the interpretive center. Outside, four pedestrian trails connect the interpretive center with Giant Springs Heritage State Park, and a bicycle-pedestrian trail connects the interpretive center with the River's Edge Trail via a tunnel beneath Giant Springs Road.\n\nInside the center, the exhibits are educational and interactive. The ground floor includes the ornate Compass Rose, with a list of private contributors who helped finance the original construction. Only half of the construction cost was funded with federal money. Pictographs tell the explorers' story in Indian drawings. Grabbing the most attention as visitors enter the center is a striking life-size diorama of buckskin-clad explorers hefting a 30-foot canoe up a ravine in their portage around the falls. The exhibit stretches two stories and is framed by vast windows overlooking the Missouri.\n\nThe center \"imparts to the public a personal sense of President Thomas Jefferson's vision of expanding America to the west; it inspires awe and awakens curiosity toward the challenges faced by the expedition as they portaged the great falls of the Missouri river and explored the 'unknown'; brings to life the daily experiences of the expedition and the environment and native peoples of the 'uncharted West'; and celebrated the indomitable spirit of human discovery we all share,\" according to the center's mission statement.\n\nThe 26th Annual Lewis and Clark Festival is taking place June 19-21 and promises to deliver participants \"back to ways of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and life out on the open frontier of the West.\" This special event includes historical programs, children's activities, Native American cultural programs, artisans and local craftspeople and a variety of local food vendors.\n\nOn Fridays beginning June 26, \"Riverside Voices,\" staff of the center and guest presenters, offer evening programs in the amphitheater on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River or in the indoor theater. Topics include medicine on the expedition, the boats used in the journey, changes in the river since the exploration and more Lewis and Clark history and related subjects. A \"Star Party Extravaganza\" for learning about our night sky with the Central Montana Astronomy Society, is Sept. 25 in the center's parking lot.\n\nSummer hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Costs are $8 for adults and free for those 15 and younger. Federal Interagency Annual, Senior, Military and Access Passes are honored for free entry.\n\nContact Information: 4201 Giant Springs Road, Great Falls, MT 59405. Phone: 406-727-8733.\n\n4 Alive @ Five\n\nIf you enjoy live music, street dancing and great food, friends and fun, plan to attend Alive @ 5, a \"big city experience in the heart of Great Falls.\" Every Thursday from June 11 through Aug. 6 (except for July 30), one designated area of downtown comes alive with \"the finest street music tradition\" of food vendors, liquid refreshments, live music and activities for children. The June 18 date was reserved for \"Taste of Great Falls,\" a sampling of fare from local restaurants, and Aug. 6 also will be a fundraiser for Roberts Park. The events are held from 5 to 9 p.m. Call 406-453-6151 or visit downtowngreatfalls.net for more information.\n\n5 Giant Springs State Park\n\nFirst documented by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805, Giant Springs is one of the largest freshwater springs in the world. This is also the site of the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's shortest river. Giant Springs flows at a measured 7.9 million gallons per hour or 156 million gallons of water per day. The water stays at a temperature of 54 degrees and has been carbon dated to be about 3,000 years old. More than a quarter of a million lovers of nature visit Giant Springs Heritage Park each year. Many come to marvel at this remarkable feature, or to view the 80-plus species of birds, mammals and reptiles. On any day you may find bicyclists, fishing enthusiasts, photographers and many others; some come to visit the nearby Rainbow Falls Overlook, the visitor center and the fish hatchery.\n\nThe fish hatchery program raises from 700,000 to 800,000 fish annually. They are then distributed to areas in central Montana from the Canadian border to the Wyoming border. A group picnic site is also available. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks visitor center (right across from the roadway from the springs) features taxidermy mounts of grizzly and black bears, educational features on fish and bird recognition, wildlife photographs, and a mini-theater that shows wildlife videos. Pets on leash are welcome.\n\nEvents at the park include ranger talks dealing with the wildlife of the area, bird strolls and kids activities. Check the website at stateparks.mt.gov for specific dates. Concerts will be held in the park on July 12 and Aug.9, and visitors may want to plan to attend Movie Night in the Park on Aug. 21 or the Fall Family Fest on Oct. 17.\n\nLocated off U.S. Highway 87 in Great Falls, then a mile east on River Drive to Giant Springs Road. The park is open year-round from are 8 a.m. to sunset; the visitor center is open Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free for vehicles with Montana plates and $6 per vehicle for those from out-of-state.\n\n6 Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art\n\nOne of Great Falls' oldest and most recognizable landmarks, the Square, at 1400 1st Ave. N., has served as a center for learning and growth for more than 100 years. Built of native gray sandstone, the structure was completed in 1896 and served for 34 years as a high school and for 45 years as a junior high. \"Art is for everyone\" is the premise of the Square; since 1977, it has provided a \"dynamic program of exhibitions, classes, lectures, tours and performances designed to nurture the region's creative spirit.\"\n\nThe \"Val Knight Retrospective,\" a new permanent exhibition has been added to the Square and includes 25 remarkable works done from the 1960s to the 1990s by the late Great Falls artist in a variety of media that includes encaustic paintings, ceramic figurines and graphic drawings. Other summer exhibitions include \"The Blind Men & the Elephant: Drawings by Steven Glueckert\" until Aug. 1; \"Artist in Residence – Danielle O'Malley\" until Sept. 1; \"Alas, the Pelicans: Randi O'Brian\" until Sept. 11; and Manel Alvares: A Journey\" July 28-Oct. 16.\n\nHome-style cooking with an international flair is the forté of Café Paris, which is open for two lunch services, at noon and 12:30 p.m., on Wednesdays and Thursdays of each week. Lunches are priced at $15. Reservations are required.\n\nAdmission is free as a gift to the community from Farmers Union Insurance. Open Monday to Friday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday, 5-9 p.m. and Saturday, noon-5 p.m. Closed Sundays, July 4 and Labor Day. Call 406-727-8255 or visit www.the-square.org.\n\n7 The History Museum\n\n\"When you enter the History Museum, you walk back in time in North Central Montana!\" promises the 47,000-square-foot museum at 4223 2nd St. S., in the old Northern School Supply building. Permanent exhibits on Cascade County and northcentral Montana are featured, and temporary exhibitions on topics ranging from Montana history to local art augment the collection. Current exhibits include a salute to the history of nursing at the Columbus Hospital from 1900 to 1968 and a new exhibit centered around the history of downtown Great Falls. Permanent exhibits include the Bovey carriage, models of the Opera House and Park Hotel and displays on the Ozark Club and Native Americans. As well as \"Under the Big Stack: the Great Falls Smelter\" about the Anaconda Copper Mining Company's history in Great Falls.\n\nThe Museum also houses the Archival Research Center on the second floor, a gift shop and space available for special events. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and by appointment on weekends. Admission is free with donations welcome. Call the History Museum at 452-3462 or visit www.thehistorymuseum.org.\n\n8 Children's Museum of Montana\n\nThe Children's Museum is a wonderland where \"please touch\" is one of the most important rules. The museum, which turned 14 in February, is an educational and community resource \"dedicated to the notion that children learn best by doing.\" Exhibits and programs focused on history and culture, science and technology, health and nutrition, visual and performing arts and regional culture offer a unique hands-on adventure.\n\nLocated at 22 Railroad Square, the museum is just northwest of the Civic Center and within a Frisbee flip of Gibson Park.

The facility, which is open from dawn to dusk, is free for skateboarders, in-line skaters and roller skaters. The skaters' paradise is in Elks Riverside Park, 500 River Drive N., behind the Girl Scout cabin and near the Gibson Park underpass.\n\n12 Great Falls Pools\n\nFour city-run aquatic facilities offer lessons and programs year round:\n\nElectric City Water Park can be found at River Drive and 1st Avenue South. Beat the heat with as many ways you can get wet, including body-boarding on the \"Flow Rider\" where 36,000 gallons of water rushes through every minute, riding the \"Power Tower Plunge\" and ending up in the \"Lazy River,\" which circles a quarter-mile around the \"Flow Rider\" or swimming in \"Mitchell Pool,\" Montana's largest public heated outdoor pool.

He demanded parks, and that's what we got. His namesake is the centerpiece of the park system. Located at Park Drive and 1st Avenue North, Gibson Park features a duck pond, flower gardens, a walking path, basketball courts, restrooms and a playground. Summertime concerts take place at an outdoor band shell. A pedestrian underpass from Gibson Park takes you to Elks Riverside Park, a lesser-known but huge park along the river that features tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a skate park, playground equipment and large expanses of grass where you can fly a kite, play catch or simply relax.\n\nAny sunny day, you'll also find people picnicking, playing games or simply lounging in the rest of the city's 400 acres developed into 57 parks. Two dozen usable public tennis courts also are scattered around the city. A complex of eight courts is available for public use at C.M. Russell High School. In addition, there are three on River Drive North near the 6th Street underpass; four at Montana Park; two each at Lions, West Kiwanis and Jaycee parks; and one each at Sunrise, Charles Russell and North Kiwanis parks. Call Parks and Recreation Administration at 771-1265 for more information.\n\n14 Pacific Steel and Recycling Trailside Dog Park\n\nAn attractively fenced and landscaped area where dogs can \"run free and play 'off leash' with their canine and human friends,\" the dog park, located at 800 River Drive North alongside River's Edge Trail, was opened July 15, 2009. The park was built for less than $100,000 and was financed by gifts to the Animal Foundation of Great Falls, which donated the park to the city of Great Falls. The park features a small pavilion in the middle and separate fenced and landscaped areas equipped for small and large dogs. The dividing line for dog size is 25 pounds. A paved path in the large-dog park was recently installed to protect the turf, and agility equipment on both sides of the park allows for better exercise.\n\nDog owners will find there is no charge to use the park, but they are still responsible for proper pet etiquette and obeying the rules of the Dog Park. Disposal bags and garbage cans are readily available, but drinking fountains for both humans and dogs are rather temperamental, so it's wise to bring your own water. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but it may be closed on occasion for maintenance or improvements. Watch the Tribune for announcements or call the Park and Recreation office at 771-1265. For more information, visit the foundation's website at www.theanimalfoundation.com.\n\n15 First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park\n\nFormerly called \"Ulm Pishkun,\" it is believed to be the largest prehistoric bison kill site in North America and has now been nominated to be designated a National Historic Landmark. The site, at 342 Ulm-Vaughn Road, consists of a mile-long sandstone cliff, remnants of drive lines and up to 18 feet of compacted buffalo remains as well as \"expansive panoramic views\" of the Rocky Mountain Front, the Missouri River valley and characteristic buttes and grasslands of the High Plains. Plan at least two hours at this day-use-only park for enjoying the interpretive trail, picnic tables and a protected black-tailed prairie dog town.\n\nThe site is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. until October. Admission is free for state residents or $6 per vehicle for out-of-state visitors. Call 866-2217 for more information.\n\n16 Farmers Market\n\nNo longer just about the abundance of vegetables sold here, the Great Falls Farmers Market is held on Saturdays beginning June 6 through Sept. 26, from 7:45 a.m. to noon, in the Civic Center's Whittier Park. As the popularity of the market has grown, so has the number of vendors, so much that the market has expanded from Civic Center Park onto Park Drive and into the parking lot across the street, and a Wednesday market has been added to the schedule from July 18 to Sept. 23, 4:30-6:30 p.m. More than 100 vendors are expected to bring unique hand-crafted items of all kinds, baked goods, jams, jellies, syrups and all kinds of ready-to-eat foods.

Eagle Falls, adjacent to Legion Park at 25th Street and River Drive North, and Anaconda Hills, a short, hilly course in Black Eagle on the north side of the Missouri River, 2400 Smelter Ave. Both courses offer driving ranges as well as full pro shops and concessions. Other courses include Hickory Swing, a public course at 1100 American Ave., and Meadow Lark Country Club at the confluence of the Sun and Missouri rivers at 300 Country Club Blvd.\n\nEagle Falls Golf Club is an 18-hole course open to the public. Opened in 1953, it underwent a major re-design in 1999 and now plays from 5,234 to 6,571 yards as a par 71. Four sets of tees make it inviting for the casual player and extremely challenging for the avid golfer. There is also a newly designed chipping green, a putting green, practice bunker and a limited driving range. Reserve tee times two days in advance by calling 761-1078.\n\nAnaconda Hills Golf Course is also a city-run course opened originally in the 1920s as a nine-hole course for the employees of the Anaconda Copper Co. The city acquired the course in the 1970s, and nine new holes and grass greens were added in 1992. Hilly and tree-lined with natural rough and water, the par 69 course is slightly less than 5,700 yards. Call 761-8459.\n\nFounded in 1919, the private Meadow Lark Country Club is recognized as having one of the great classic designs with a reputation for sleek, undulating greens. The 18-hole championship course is considered one of the top 10 places to play in Montana. The club also includes a clubhouse, \"award-winning pro shop, formal dining room and more casual grill room, three indoor and four outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool open Memorial Day to Labor Day. Call 453-6531.\n\nHickory Swing is an 18-hole par 60 executive golf course in west Great Falls. It plays 3,731 yards over 86 acres. It was built in 1992 as a course for all skill levels. A back nine was opened in 1999, and the course has 12 par-3s and six par-4s. Hickory Swing also offers a clubhouse with pro shop and snack bar and a driving range. Open from February (weather permitting) through October, the course now opens at 6 a.m. for early-bird golfers. $20 for 18 holes, $12 for nine; call 452-9400 for available tee times.\n\n19 The Great Falls Dams\n\nThe beautiful waterfalls east of Great Falls now are mostly covered by a series of hydroelectric dams. But glimpses of the falls so famously journaled by Lewis and Clark remain, especially when water is running high on the Missouri. Visitors have several opportunities to view these dams. Perhaps the easiest is Black Eagle Dam, which can be seen close up on the River's Edge Trail or from an overlook on River Road. Just downstream, Rainbow Dam has also been offering beautiful views since 1910 and has undergone a construction project increasing its generating capacity by 70 percent. Between these two is Cochrane Dam, part of the Great Falls Portage National Landmark, which produces 64 megawatts of electricity. Ryan Dam, the original \"great falls of the Missouri,\" is an especially fun destination. A suspension foot bridge leads to an island from which visitors can climb to an observation point and get a full-on view of the dam. The island has a picnic and cooking area very popular with families. Morony Dam is 15 miles northeast of Great Falls. It's classified as a \"run-of-river\" project because it can generate electricity using the water that flows down the river without need to store additional supplies. Boaters, hikers and fishermen should call 454-5840 for current trailhead, boat launch and parking closures.\n\n20 Black Eagle Memorial Island\n\nBlack Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public for the first time in 2005. Located just below Black Eagle Falls, the man-made island was created from material dredged out of the tailrace below the Black Eagle Dam's generation station. In the past, it was used as a parking lot for smelter workers at the former Anaconda Mining Co. complex. Today the area features a restored truss bridge, exceptional stone walls, a launch for non-motorized boats and an interpretive viewing plaza below the falls. The area is open for hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing and fishing and is part of the new River's Edge Trail section that links West Bank Park to the island.\n\n21 Missouri River Breaks National Monument\n\nOn a topographical map of Montana, the Missouri River Breaks look like a crumpled brown grocery bag extending west to east along the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Fort Peck. The Arrow Creek Breaks and the Musselshell Breaks contribute to the larger geographic area from the south. The Breaks, located in northcentral Montana, offer some of the finest recreational opportunities in the entire state, from river floating to hiking to hunting to horseback riding.\n\nOn the ground, the Breaks consist of rough ridges separated by steep — sometimes almost vertical — coulees. The vegetation consists of scattered Ponderosa pine, juniper, Douglas fir and mixed grasses growing in a shale/gumbo soil type. While not the most hospitable region for humans, the Breaks provide suitable habitat for an impressive list of wildlife species.\n\nThe Breaks mean different things to different people. It is defined, in part, by the history of Lewis and Clark, as a sanctuary for desperados staying a step ahead of the law and as a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders. Some enjoy the remote area mostly for the solitude and recreational opportunities provided by the Upper Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir and a mixture of public and private lands. Others see the Breaks as a source of grass for livestock, natural gas, timber products and other vital pieces of our economic puzzle.\n\nIn 2001, a portion of the public land in the Breaks managed by the Bureau of Land Management, roughly 375,000 acres, was designated as the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\n\nU.S. Highway 87 accesses the western portion of the monument at Fort Benton. On the eastern edge, U.S. Highway 101 crosses the monument and the Missouri at the James Kipp Recreation Area, and Montana Highway 236 also provides access through Lewistown, Winifred and Big Sandy.\n\nThere are no motels, service stations or restaurants in the interior of the Monument. The Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center in Fort Benton is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday Call 622-4000.\n\n22 Monarch and Neihart\n\nAn hour's drive from Great Falls, these neighboring mountain towns are located in a historic mining district. The mines are closed, but the surrounding mountains are open to fun. Local creeks offer excellent fishing. There are scores of trails and backcountry roads to explore on foot, mountain bike or all-terrain vehicle. Check at trailheads for info on motorized access. Check out the easy, half-mile hike to popular Memorial Falls. Camping is available in some areas. The wildlife viewing is terrific. And winter offers a wide range of activities, including snowmobiling, downhill skiing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\n23 Sluice Boxes State Park\n\nJust south of Belt, where Belt Creek slices out of the Little Belt Mountains is an area of soaring limestone cliffs and precipitous ledges, the Belt Creek Canyon and Sluice Boxes State Park. Rich in history and geologic features, the park provides excellent hiking and viewing of abundant wildlife in a wide range of habitats from shaded rock walls and miniature waterfalls to open, sun-baked slopes covered in prairie grasses. Enjoying the park, however, is not for the faint of heart. Because the train bridges were removed, hikers must ford the creek. That's nearly impossible during high water, so hiking in the Sluice Boxes is limited to the low-water season — usually mid-July through September. The creek is spring-fed and cold. Backcountry camping is allowed with permit year-round. The only facilities are the parking lot, vault toilet and the trail which follows an abandoned rail grade. Call 454-5840 or visit stateparksmt.gov/sluice-boxes.\n\n24 Fort Benton's Riverfront\n\nThe historic community of Fort Benton, 42 miles north of Great Falls, boasts a stunning setting on the banks of the Missouri River. The site of a pre-Civil War trading post and key economic point during the \"steamboat era,\" the town is the water gateway to the Missouri Breaks National Monument and a popular launch site for rafts and canoes. Reconstruction of three buildings of the fort is taking place; the Northeast Bastion and Blockhouse are now historically accurate. A heroic-sized statue of explorers Lewis and Clark overlooks the river along a scenic walking path. Another statue immortalizes Shep, a legendarily faithful dog. A walking bridge spans the river and offers benches for rest and reflection. There's lots to do elsewhere in town, which has two museums and a historic restored hotel, the Grand Union, which boasts a fine restaurant. From June 26 to 28, visitors may experience Montana's premier small town festival. In celebration of Chouteau County's 150th birth, the theme this year is \"Footsteps Through Time.\" Call 750-2918.\n\n25 Havre Beneath the Streets\n\nThe Historical Underground Tour is a recreation of Havre's history. When fire destroyed most of Havre, business owners moved underground to carry on their business until the town could be rebuilt. Step back in time as much as 100 years, into the Sporting Eagle Saloon, a turn-of-the-century honky-tonk where cowboys gambled, kicked up their heels and drank good old-fashioned frontier rot-gut. Saunter along the streets beneath Havre and see an opium den (one of three known to have existed in the early days), a Chinese laundry, an ethnic restaurant, and, of course, a bordello.\n\nTours are available during summer months Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:30 p.m. Reservations are recommended; the ticket office is at 120 3rd Ave., south of Norman's Ranch Wear.

Take a one-hour walking tour for a close-up look at the best-preserved bison kill and campsite in this area of the plains. The Brick Mural is now complete in the shadow of the Bear Paw Mountains. The site is non-sterile, so visitors may handle certain artifacts. Open June 1 to Labor Day from 9 a.m. to 4.p.m. Tours are usually available \"on demand.\" Call 265-6417 or visit www.buffalojump.org for more information.\n\n27 Fort Assiniboine Historic Site\n\nFort Assiniboine Historic Site, located 6 miles southwest of Havre on Highway 87, was constructed in 1879, and became the largest military fort west of the Mississippi River. The post had 104 buildings and was contained within a 40-mile-long by 15-mile-wide military reservation. Several of the original buildings still stand. It became a state agricultural experiment station in 1911 and is now the home of Montana State University's Northern Agricultural Research Center. The primary mission of the fort's garrison was to prevent attacks from the some 5,000 Lakota Sioux Indians led by Sitting Bull, and other chiefs who had fled to the safety of Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n\nThe fort served as a base for patrols along the Canadian border and the Milk River Valley. Fort Assiniboine became the state's military headquarters, with the responsibility of maintaining control over the Blackfoot Confederacy and other northern Montana Indian reservations. The most famous soldier to serve at the fort was John J. Pershing, who was assigned to the post in 1896. He commanded H Troop, the black \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 10th Cavalry. The Fort Assiniboine Preservation Society offers summer tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., and by appointment for the weekends.

Now beginning at Kingston Junction, near Lewistown, and crossing three trestle bridges on its route to Denton and back, the 3.5 hour trip offers includes a full course prime rib dinner, dessert, no-host cash bar and musical entertainment.

Mountain ranges surround three sides, forming a backdrop to a scene that reminds visitors of the days when the entire prairie-wetland ecosystem was alive with thousands of different birds. Benton Lake was created thousands of years ago by the continental glacier, and the area was excluded from homesteading in 1885 in order to provide an irrigation district. Animals abound in the refuge and include water birds such as ducks, Canada geese, snow geese and tundra swans. Also common are sightings of dozens of species of mammals, including mountain cottontail, American badger, striped skunk and long-tailed weasel. Ten numbered signs along the Wildlife Auto Tour correspond to a map provided at the information kiosk at the beginning of the drive, helping visitors reflect on species, habitat, history and management of Benton Lake NWR. Follow Highway 87 north out of Great Falls about 1 mile and turn left onto Bootlegger Trail. Then go about 9 miles to the refuge entrance. The visitor center is open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday Call 406-727-7400.\n\n35 The Annual Montana Atlatl Mammoth Hunt\n\nExperts and novices from around the country, and even the world, come to try their hand at throwing the atlatl, an 8,000-year-old hunting weapon, and occasionally the primitive bow, tomahawk and knife. Regional members of the World Atlatl Association in conjunction with First Peoples Buffalo State Park set targets along one section of the trail. Participants are required to walk the trail, so bring hiking boots or comfortable shoes. Hunts are set for Sept. 5-6. Call 866-2217 for further information.\n\nMISSOURI COUNTRY\n\n36 Fort Peck Lake Reservoir and Recreation Area\n\nBehind the 3.8 mile long Fort Peck Dam — the world's largest hydroelectric earthen dam — is the state's largest body of water, Fort Peck Lake Reservoir. It is surrounded by 1,520 miles of shoreline — that's more than California has with the Pacific Ocean. The fishing is great with more than 50 kinds of fish, including walleye, bass, ling and salmon, northern pike, perch and sauger. Open Memorial Day to Labor Day, the shore also offers camping, boating and swimming. A paved road for larger vehicles provides access to the reservoir at Fort Peck Marina; all other access roads are gravel or dirt. The C.M.

In 2006, they received state funding for the creation of the museum. Opened in 2008, the 3,000-square-foot Great Plains Dinosaur Museum showcases a \"stunning variety\" of real fossils of fish, squids, lobsters and rare crabs, plants and some of Montana's best-preserved dinosaurs, including Triceratops, Stegasaurus, Sauropod, raptor Dromesaurus and Handrosaurus.

Visitors interested in their turn-of-the-century exploits can still check out several sites along the so-called Outlaw Trail. Start in Scobey, near the beginning of the trail, where Dutch Henry and his gang frequently hung out at the Dug Out Saloon. Much of the history is captured at the Daniels County Museum and Pioneer Town, where 35 historic buildings were restored to depict a town in the early part of the century. If you're in Scobey the last weekend in June, stop by for Pioneer Days, featuring the (family-friendly) Dirty Shame Show. Call 406-487-5965 to confirm dates. Historic walking tours with interpretive signs are available in the area.\n\n41 C.M. Russell Wildlife Refuge\n\nCovering more than a million acres in northeast Montana and extending 125 airline miles up the Missouri River from Fort Peck Dam, the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge includes a vast range of wildlife and topography. Native prairie, forested coulees, river bottoms, badlands often portrayed in the paintings by Charlie Russell, and the huge Fort Peck Reservoir all are encompassed in the refuge.

Call Complex headquarters at 538-7521.\n\nGLACIER COUNTRY\n\n42 Blackfeet Indian Reservation\n\nWhile most of the members of Montana's largest Indian tribe, the Blackfeet, live much like mainstream Western society, they also have maintained traditions such as the use of painted tepees, colorful headdresses and deerskin costumes on special occasions. The Museum of the Plains Indian, near the intersection of U.S. Highways 2 and 89 in Browning, has a comprehensive collection of cultural artifacts and exhibits as well as a gift shop featuring a wide variety of Native American art and jewelry. Interpreter-guided tours, offering a deeper look at the history of the Blackfeet people, begin at the Museum of the Plains Indian and cover sites such as Sun Dance, Buffalo Jumps, Tepee Rings, Holy Family Mission and Fort McLeod Road. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-4:45 p.m., through Labor Day. Call 338-2230. Although Browning is its center, resort towns St. Mary and East Glacier are located on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park within the boundaries of the reservation.\n\nDuring the 64th annual North American Indian Days, July 9-12, tepees will be pitched on the powwow ground for \"four days of contest dancing, games, sports, events and socializing.\" Call 338-7406 for more information. The Heart Butte Society Celebration will be held Aug. 6-9 at Heart Butte, a town 26 miles south of Browning.\n\n43 Glacier National Park\n\nThe breathtaking vistas of Glacier National Park draw visitors from all over the world. This 1-million-acre national park preserves some of America's most gorgeous country — including 106 miles of the Continental Divide — and the abundant wildlife that inhabits its wilderness.\n\nGlacier National Park has been revered by the Plains Indians for many generations. Archeologists have found evidence of human activity in the Glacier Park area that dates back 10,000 years. These early people may have been the ancestors of the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai Indians. Meriwether Lewis came close to the southern tip of Glacier in 1806, checking how far north the Missouri River watershed extended. White explorers kept searching for the perfect mountain pass through which to run a railroad line over the Rockies. Although many of the region's Native Americans knew the location of Marias Pass, the Blackfeet guarded it closely. In 1889, an explorer for the Great Northern Railway, John F. Stevens, finally figured out where Marias Pass lay. Marias was the lowest mountain pass between Canada and Mexico. Its low altitude and easy grade made it perfect for trains to cross the Continental Divide. The mountains east of the Continental Divide were acquired from the Blackfeet in 1895 and designated a national wilderness forest preserve in 1900, opening it to mining. President William Howard Taft signed the bill to establish Glacier as a national park in 1910.\n\nPortions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year, but unpredictable spring snow storms can slow plowing progress. For current road status, visit home.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm. Other roads open in May, weather permitting. The summer rate for a 7-day vehicle (non-commercial car, truck or van) permit is $25 with the 7-day single-entry price for visitors traveling by foot, bicycle, motorcycle or in a non-commercial organized group is set at $12. There is no entrance fee on Aug. 25 and Sept. 26.\n\nThere are 700 miles of hiking trails, and many visitors wouldn't miss a chance to hike along the Garden Wall. Campers have a choice of about 1,200 first-come, first-serve campsites accessible by vehicle, and permits are available for 13 country front campgrounds. The historic Many Glacier Hotel has recently undergone a $10 million renovation, but historic hotels book up fast; call Glacier Park Inc. at 892-2525 or Apgar Village Lodge at 888-5484.Tour buses and boats are available seasonally, and guided hiking trips and American Indian interpretive tours are also available. Many visitors also make arrangements to cross the border into Waterton Lakes National Park on the Canadian side of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.\n\n44 Izaak Walton Inn\n\nLocated just off Highway 2 at Essex, on the southern tip of Glacier National Park, is the picturesque Izaak Walton Inn. It was built in 1939 for train crews on the Great Northern Railway. Today it's a popular inn, restaurant and mini railroad museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dining room walls are covered with old photographs and prints of trains. \"Relaxation is key,\" and \"room telephones are absent\" in the inn. For a different experience, rent one of the four old cabooses that have been converted into overnight lodging or stay in one of six new family cabins. Additional lodging is now available in the GN 441 Luxury Locomotive which features 44-year-old reclaimed oak floors and a full kitchen, and the JJ Caboose, named for James Jerome Hill, the Empire Builder of the Great Northern Railway, for an unsurpassed cozy western retreat. The trains still run past the inn, with passenger service available. And Essex is a great place from which to find a trailhead into the surrounding mountains. You may also book Glacier interpretive Red Bus tours or whitewater raft trips from the inn. For information or reservations, call 406-888-5700 or visit www.izaakwaltoninn.com.\n\n45 Flathead Valley\n\nIn the northwest corner of Montana lies the picturesque Flathead Valley. A hub for tourism, the valley sits next to Glacier National Park and is overflowing with activity. From hiking, fishing, boating and golfing in the summer to cross-country or downhill skiing in the winter, the only thing visitors will wish for more of is time. Flathead Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, and the resort town, Bigfork, situated at its north shore, is a picturesque town with a 27-hole golf course, Eagle Bend Golf Club (837-7310). Family fun abounds in the area, with the Big Sky Water Park in Columbia Falls (892-5025) and numerous fresh huckleberry and Flathead cherry stands scattered throughout the valley. Hungry Horse Dam is the 11th largest concrete dam in the United States, and its spillway is the highest morning-glory structure in the world. During the summer, the visitor center is open from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Call 387-5241. Boating, fishing, hiking and camping are available at the reservoir. Kalispell, the largest city in the valley, is home of the Conrad Mansion, built in 1895 by the city's founder, as well as a picturesque downtown shopping area with tons of local flavor. Call the Flathead Convention and Visitors Bureau at 800-543-3105.\n\n46 Saint Ignatius Mission\n\nBuilt in 1854 by Native Americans under the supervision of Catholic missionaries who came to convert the locals, the Mission's setting is beautiful, with the Mission Mountains in the background. The striking building features 61 original murals along its walls and on its ceiling. These are by Joseph Carignano, a Jesuit priest who served at the mission. The mission is open for private worship 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the summer with Sunday Mass at 9:15 a.m. Reservations are not accepted, but walk-ins are welcome. Gift shop on site.

Self-guided, drive-through tours are available to observe the more than 400 bison, deer, elk, antelope and birds that make their home on the preserve. Red Sleep Mountain Drive is open during the summer while the winter drive is no longer open to two-way traffic. No motorcycles or bicycles are allowed for the safety of the animals and visitors. Visit the range in spring for the abundant wild flowers and in October to watch the annual bison round up, a hugely popular event. New restrictions exclude longer vehicles as well as any trailer or towed vehicle. Visitors' Center is open daily 10 a.m.-2 p.m., but the front gate is open 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.\n\n48 Whitefish Mountain Resort\n\nOpening day is June 20! Located on the edge of Whitefish and just west of Glacier Park, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a world-class downhill ski destination. It offers lodging, restaurants, lots of activities and some of the best views in the area. That goes for summer, too. Take the 15-minute gondola ride to the top of the mountain and witness stunning vistas of Glacier Park and the surrounding area. Have lunch, and then hop the gondola for the trip down. Better yet, take the scenic walking trail. The Zipline Tour is for adventurous visitors who will strap on a paragliding-style harness and click onto a custom built cable trolley to fly 300 feet off the ground at speeds up to 50 mph! People of all ability levels may enjoy the Aerial Adventure Park where they can learn to navigate treetop courses. In July and August wildflower walks are offered. Other guided tours are also available. Visit skiwhitefish.com.\n\n49 Flathead Lake\n\nFlathead Lake is the most popular — and most used — water playground in the state. It's the largest natural freshwater lake in the Western states. The lake is 28 miles long and, at its widest, 15 miles across. Maximum depth is 386 feet. Anglers delight in the fishing.

There's lots of lodging and restaurants available along different stretches of the shore.\n\n50 Yaak Falls\n\nThis waterfall is the highlight for many visitors as they tour through the Yaak area in extreme northwest Montana. During spring and early summer tremendous viewing opportunities abound in the Yaak River area as snowmelt follows its way down and over the falls. For any photographer, this is one sight that shouldn't be missed. This site can be found on a Kootenai National Forest Visitors Map at Township 33N, Range 33W, Section 9. The Yaak Falls, named after the Yaak Indians who once populated this remote area of Montana, has always been a favorite stop on the scenic tour of northwest Montana. This beautifully cascading waterfall was created by the eastward shift of the Pacific plate. As a result of this shifting, some of the oldest rock in the world is exposed. The rock is dated between 800 million and 11/2 billion years old. This area is rich in local history, dating back to the 1880s. Part of an old bridge can be seen just below the falls. This bridge was the first structure to span the Yaak River. This allowed unrestricted passage from Troy to another important mining town called Sylvanite. Many placer mining camps, including one called \"Snipe Town,\" operated near the falls in the 1890s. In 1910, a devastating fire destroyed mining operations around the falls area. The Yaak Falls Campground is a little pack-in, pack-out campground with a maximum stay of 14 days and no fees. No toilets or drinking water are available. Call 295-4693.\n\n51 Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs, founded in 1910, is named for the local hot mineral springs that still bubble today. Thousands of people seeking rest and relief from pressure travel to the town of Hot Springs to bathe in the fine mineral water and mud baths. Many revisit on a regular basis, enjoying the benefits and relief that the natural hot mineral waters bring in the treatment of arthritis, skin diseases, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure and many other ailments. Opportunities for privacy, quietness, and relaxation abound in this area. Many lakes, streams and rivers provide excellent fishing for the avid fisherman. Nearby sight-seeing attractions include a tour of the National Bison Range at Moiese, a visit to the historical St. Ignatius Mission Church and Flathead Lake with its many opportunities for boating, jet skiing, water skiing and fishing.\n\n52 Seeley Lake\n\nNamed for the lake it abuts, Seeley Lake is a small town quickly growing in popularity with tourists. In winter, it's known for great snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, dog sledding and ice fishing. Summer recreation is even more plentiful. The lake itself offers camping, boating, swimming and fishing. Nearby trails head off into both the Bob Marshall and Mission Mountain wilderness areas. Folks on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles love all the old logging roads. The Clearwater River, which runs south through the valley, and the Swan River which flows north, offer fishing and canoeing. Golfers enjoy the nine-hole mountain course and more at Double Arrow Resort on the south edge of town. Call the Seeley Lake Area Chamber of Commerce at 677-2880.\n\nSeveral guest ranches offer horseback riding. There's camping and boating also available at nearby Swan Lake and Placid Lake. Just a short drive from Seeley Lake is the trailhead to Morrell Falls. A fairly flat, 2.5-mile hike leads to a stunning drop of falls — and a great place for a picnic. The hike is popular with families because children often enjoy splashing in Morrell Creek below the falls. Bring drinking water.\n\n53 The Sweet Palace\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth at the Sweet Palace at 109 E. Broadway in Philipsburg, and view what nostalgic, sumptuous sweets are cooking.

During the summer, they're open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. but are closed on Saturdays.\n\n54 A Carousel for Missoula\n\nLocated in Missoula's Caras Park, the colorful carousel is a gift to the city from one man's dream — and the volunteer work of many others. In 1991, cabinet builder Chuck Kaparich told city residents that if they'd provide a home for it, he'd build the carousel. When it opened four years later, more than 100,000 volunteer hours were logged on the project. Locals volunteered time and materials. The result: 38 hand-carved ponies, two chariots, 14 gargoyles and the largest band organ in continuous use in the country. A carving organization in Calgary, Alberta, even carved a friendship horse for the project. It's all contained within a building that looks like a jewel box. Dragons Hollow, the play area for children was added next to the carousel in 1995. Hours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. June-August. Call 549-8382.\n\n55 Historical Museum at Fort Missoula\n\nCommunity members joined together in 1974 to save what was left of the historic 1877 Fort Missoula which had housed the black 25th Infantry in 1888 and served as a military training center during World War I, regional headquarters of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and as an alien detention center in 1941. The post was decommissioned in 1947. Today the museum is the collection point for history and memorabilia of the Missoula area. Located on 32 acres, it houses 13 structures and more than 25,000 artifacts. Current exhibits include \"Growing the Garden City: Missoula's First 50 Years\" and \"The Road to Today: 250 Years of Missoula's History.\" Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday to Saturday and Noon -5 p.m. on Sunday. Call 728-3476 or visit www.fortmissoulamuseum.org.\n\n56 Hike-the-M in Missoula\n\nVisitors to Missoula can gain a dizzying view of the campus of University of Montana with a short but steep hike to Mount Sentinel's M in Missoula. The M-hike is an ideal family activity, but the more ambitious hiker may consider tackling Sentinel itself. Reaching the summit is a bit more strenuous than the M, with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet in about one mile. From the summit, hikers have several options to extend their hike or descend the same way they came up. Mt. Jumbo, Mt. Sentinel's sister peak, branded with an L for Loyola High School, offers a climb of barely a mile, but there are fewer switchbacks to help with the climb.\n\n57 Alberton Gorge\n\nSome 30 miles west of Missoula on the Clark Fork River is the Alberton Gorge, the area's premier whitewater run for rafting and kayaking. It features Class III water, as well as quiet pools for swimming and fishing. Floaters are treated to many varieties of birds and wildlife, dramatic cliffs and roller-coaster rapids. Local companies offer full-day and half-day float trips. Only experienced floaters should hit the rapids without a guide. Call 722-7238 for more information.\n\n58 Travelers' Rest State Park\n\nLocated south of Lolo in the Bitterroot Valley, Travelers' Rest marks the old Indian campsite used by Lewis and Clark in both 1805 and 1806 as they made their way through the area. In recent years archaeologists found evidence of the expedition's main cook fire and latrine, which confirmed the explorers had been there. Activities for visitors include bird watching, children's activities, educational programs and fly fishing. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the summer, the visitors' center opens at 9 a.m. The entrance is located ½ mile west of Lolo. Call 273-4253 or visit www.travelersrest.org.\n\n59 Garnet Ghost Town\n\n\"To walk the streets of this ghost town is to step back in time, free from intrusion of modern society!\"A former gold-mining camp east of Missoula, Garnet once boasted some 1,000 residents, a school, many businesses and 13 bars. But by 1912 the gold had played out and a raging fire sent most of the remaining residents packing. Today, Garnet is now considered the state's best-preserved ghost town. Garnet is open to tourists. Open year-round, but access is limited to snowmobile or cross-country skis in winter. For access instructions and restrictions, visit garnetghosttown.net or call 329-3914.\n\nGOLD WEST COUNTRY\n\n60 Virginia City\n\nVirginia City — and the nearby Nevada City — had their glory days during the 1860s gold rush. Seemingly frozen in time, much of their splendor is well preserved, and Virginia City now is a hot destination for history buffs and others seeking a window on the state's past. Virginia City is a National Historic Landmark, a very much alive ghost town that boasts a tremendous collection of old-west memorabilia. Many of the buildings are restored and now give visitors a real-life feel of the past. The Nevada City Living History Museum is open every summer. The summer of 2014 will be filled with fun events celebrating the sesquicentennial of finding gold in Alder Gulch and the cultural heritage of Virginia City. Events are planned every weekend through Labor Day, and there are opportunities for fun and learning throughout the season.

It showcases the development of the cattle industry over the last 150 years with 80 historical structures including a ranch house, bunkhouse and outbuildings which operate much today as they did in the late 1800s and commemorate the role of cattlemen in American history. Visitors may reflect on Montana's early ranch days by beginning guided tours at the main ranch house. The visitors' center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and until 5:30 from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 846-2070.\n\n62 Bannack State Park\n\nThe first major gold strike in Montana was in Bannack. The mining camp quickly swelled to a bustling town of 3,000. It was the first territorial capital of Montana and became home to the infamous Sheriff Henry Plummer and the Vigilantes. Located about 25 miles south of Dillon on Grasshopper Creek, Bannack became a state park in 1954. Visitors can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the many buildings that have been preserved as part of this National Historic Landmark. History comes alive the third weekend of July each year during Bannack Days. Get in on the first annual Living History Days in September where re-enactors will depict the first 20 years of Bannack history. There are self-guided tours year round and guided tours by special request. Visitors may have fun panning for gold on their own and will enjoy \"Saturdays in the Park\" with a special project presented each Saturday in the summer. Camping is available year round, and check out the tepee during the summer season. The townsite is open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 834-3413.\n\n63 Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park\n\nLocated on Montana Highway 2, 19 miles west of Three Forks or 17 miles east of Whitehall, the Lewis and Clark Caverns became Montana's first state park in 1937. Located on 3,000 acres along the Jefferson River, the caverns are filled with geological wonders — stalactites, stalagmites and stunning columns. Visitors can take a two-hour, two-mile guided tour through the large caverns and narrow passages. The limestone caverns remain a cool 50 degrees during even the hottest of days. The park also includes a 40-space campground, amphitheater, visitor center, 3 rental cabins, picnic area, hiking trails, RV hookups, showers, firewood, and toilets. Bring good hiking shoes and bottled water. The trek to the entrance can be tough on little ones, and strollers or backpacks are not allowed on the tour. Summer cave tours run from May 1 to Sept. 30, but campgrounds and cabins are open all year. Tours are scheduled from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and are open until 7 p.m. midsummer. Call 406-287-3541.\n\n64 Old Montana Prison\n\nBuilt by convict labor in the late 1800s, this old-style prison was in use until 1979 and was home to at least one member of the \"Wild Bunch.\" It is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Guided and self-guided tours take visitors through the massive cell block that once housed the state's worst prisoners. Sandstone walls are 24 feet high and buried 4 feet deep to prevent escape by tunneling. A museum now adjoins the prison. It is open year round seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with last admission time at 5:10 p.m. Call 406-846-3111.\n\nThe old prison also houses an auto museum with more than 150 cars, from classic Chevys to a 1903 Ford, on display. It was recently listed as one of the top 10 car museums in the country by USA Today.\n\n65 Old Works Golf Course\n\nAnaconda's history is built on copper smelting, but that history left a dirty legacy — a Superfund clean-up site. In the 1980s, the idea arose to transform the Old Works smelting site into something more useful. Today, the Old Works Golf Course is the state's only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, and is quickly building a reputation as one of the premier daily-fee golf experiences in the Northwest region. It features multiple tees, allowing players of all levels to enjoy the challenging 18 holes. The course design includes some of the byproducts of the mining days. Huge piles of black slag are incorporated into the design. It's also used in the bunkers. Measuring up to 7,700 yards, the course runs along Warm Springs Creek. Fairways are bordered by native grasses planted as part of the restoration process. Nicklaus also designed the practice facility — putting area, chipping/bunker area, two bent-grass practice tees and three practice holes. Also available are a clubhouse, dining room and bar and pro shop. Call 563-5989 for prices and tee times.\n\n66 Big Hole National Battlefield\n\nThe site of a battle between the Nez Perce Indians and the 7th U.S. Infantry forces and civilian volunteers in 1877 as five bands of Nez Perce were fleeing the government's attempt to confine them on a small reservation in Idaho. The battlefield offers three separate trails allowing visitors access to the actual locations where the events took place. Trail guides are available at the trailheads, and a Summer Speaker Series begins on June 29 and continues every weekend through Aug. 18. The main visitor center is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.

Call 689-3155.\n\n67 Berkeley Pit\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Butte claimed fame as the Richest Hill on Earth. In 1955, copper mining in the area greatly expanded with the opening of the Berkeley Pit. By 1980, with more than 1.5 billion tons of material removed from the town's main mine, all that was left was the pit. The large, truck-operated, open-pit copper mine was world famous while in operation. Two small communities and much of Butte's former east side were swallowed up by the mine following land purchases for expansion. Now a superfund site, the pit is 7,000 feet long, 5,600 feet wide and 1,600 feet deep. It is slowly filling with water. Visitors can look at the colors of the pit from the viewing stand. Call 497-6250.\n\n68 Our Lady of the Rockies\n\nTowering 90 feet tall on the mountains overlooking Butte is Our Lady of the Rockies, a statue dedicated to all women, regardless of religion. Built entirely by volunteers, the statue was begun in 1979 and completed in 1985. That year, in a breath-taking operation, an Air National Guard team raised the 51-ton statue by Sky Crane helicopter onto its mountainside base. Today visitors can go inside the towering metal structure. During summer and early fall, tour buses take visitors to the site. A 2½ hours. Open June through October, Mon. - Sat. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., opening 1 hour later on Sun. Tours lasting 2½ hours run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Mon.-Sat. and Sun. at 11 a.m., weather permitting. Please call ahead.

Whispering Willows Spa services are available. Also on site is a 6,741-yard, 18-hole golf course. Its \"mile-high, mile-long\" fifth hole is considered one of the most challenging in the state. It's \"the Best of Montana All in One Place.\" Call 797-3241.\n\n70 Georgetown Lake\n\nLocated about 20 west miles of Anaconda, for boaters, campers, fishers and windsurfers, Georgetown Lake is a popular outdoor recreation site. The 6,000-foot mountain lake is in a stunning setting, surrounded by the Flint Creek Range to the north and the Pintlers to the south. Anglers prize the lake for its Kokanee salmon and rainbow trout. The lake features four public boat ramps. Camping is available, as are lodging, restaurants, casinos and a marina.\n\n71 Boulder Hot Springs\n\nFounded a century ago, Boulder Hot Springs is a historic hotel situated on the grounds of natural geothermal water. For most of the past 100 years, visitors have ventured here to soak and swim in the warm, relaxing water of the mineral-laden waters, the outdoor swimming pool or natural mineral steam rooms. The hotel was recently restored and includes a bed and breakfast. It's the perfect place for a conference or retreat. Famous for its buffets, spa services are also enjoyed by many visitors. The resort is backed by the Deerlodge National Forest — home to bears, moose, elk, deer, fox, antelope and coyotes. Open 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. April 1-October 31 and noon to 8 p.m. November 1-March 31. Call 406-225-4339.\n\n72 Gates of the Mountains\n\nThe Gates of the Mountains Recreation Area at upper Holter Lake is located about 20 miles north of Helena and is a famous part of the route of the Lewis and Clark expedition. A guided boat tour from the marina provides visitors with an in-depth look at the area's geography, wildlife and history. The canyon is home to scores of creatures, including mountain sheep, deer, otters, turkey vultures and even the occasional black bear. Although the 2007 Meriwether fire scorched a large part of the area, vegetation is abundant. The canyon like waterway is actually home to some plants that can't be found anywhere else. Tour guides aboard the boats say the area is a \"geologist's playground.\" Passengers have the option to stop off at the Meriwether Picnic Area, stay awhile and catch a later boat back. There are restroom facilities, a large, covered picnic structure for group gatherings and smaller individual sites with grills and tables. Hikers can tackle the jaunt to the Mann Gulch, where a forest fire killed 13 smokejumpers in 1949, or the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness. The Gates was also a significant site for Native American culture. Tour guides said the area had a deep spiritual implication which still can be seen in the pictographs painted onto the cliffs' nooks and crannies. Call 458-5241 or email tours@gatesofthemountains.com for tour schedules and prices and to make reservations.\n\n73 Montana State Capitol\n\nSince its restoration, the Montana State Capitol is a destination in its own right. The main area of the Capitol was built in 1902; two wings were added a decade later. The building is built of sandstone and granite. Atop its copper dome is a statue depicting liberty. A gift shop and museum are located just down the street in the Montana Historical Society, which offers 1-hour guided tours of the Capitol for student and tourist groups. With two weeks' notice, the Legislative Branch offers an age-appropriate 30-60 minutes presentation on the legislative process, and the Secretary of State's office can present a short program on voting and elections.

It is recommended that visitors check the calendar on the website at www.visit-the-capitol.mtgov/#tour to choose a date when few visits are already planned. The Capitol is open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday-Friday and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Call 406-444-4789.\n\n74 Archie Bray Foundation\n\nSixty years ago, on the grounds of his Western Clay Manufacturing Co. brickyard, Archie Bray founded a pottery workshop to encourage the work and creativity of potters. That simple act became a tremendous resource to ceramic artists, who now flock to the center from around the world. A prominent patron of the arts, Bray died in 1953, only two years after establishing the nonprofit Archie Bray Foundation. Since then, more than 400 artists have come to work and hone their talents at the Bray. It also sells pottery and sculpture. Tours are available. Call 406-443-3502 or visit archiebray.org for event schedules.\n\n75 Myrna Loy Center\n\nIn 1976, the Helena Film Society organized to provide alternative films and cinema to residents of the state capital. Based on the second floor of an office building, it became Second Story Cinema and enjoyed a reputation for bringing in independent films. In 1985, with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the effort expanded with the renovation of the historic Lewis and Clark County Jail into an arts center. The Myrna Loy Center officially opened six years later. Its mission is to present challenging and enriching arts programs to the community. It has sponsored hundreds of live performances, including theater, dance, jazz, folk and performance art. And, yes, it still presents alternative films. For ticket information call 406-443-0287.\n\n76 Marysville\n\nOnce a vibrant gold camp with a population of more than 4,000, the town of Marysville northwest of Helena now is nearly a ghost town. Nearly, but not quite. Some people still live here, and a little mining still goes on. Visitors may take a walking tour of the Drumlummon Hill which includes 14 sites, several of which are listed on the National Historic Register. The Catholic church and general store still serve the community and its visitors. The town now is a popular destination for sightseers and those just wanting a pleasant place for a picnic or a quiet day away from the bustle of town.\n\n77 Sun River Canyon\n\nFlowing from Gibson Reservoir, adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, is the Sun River. The canyon in this area is a spectacular setting for outdoor recreation. The reservoir is popular for boating and fishing. Hunters flock to the area in fall and winter. Boating and scenic tours are available. Situated nearby is the Sun Canyon Lodge, which offers rustic and modern cabins, a restaurant, camping, horseback and wagon rides and boating. This is a great launch site to the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Rocky Mountain Front.\n\n78 Lincoln\n\nJust a few miles from the Continental Divide, Lincoln is a mountain town that knows how to have fun in any weather. During winter, the area bustles with hunters, snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and dogsledders. Summer brings hikers, backpackers, anglers, photographers, bird watchers, campers, ATVers and others to enjoy the nearby trails, lakes, creeks and Blackfoot River. Take a night drive over nearby Roger's Pass to watch the stars far from city lights. The annual July 4 weekend rodeo draws contestants and fans from around the state. Visit the Blackfoot Valley Historical Society Museum for a taste of the past. Call the Chamber of Commerce at 362-4949 or visit www.lincolnmontana.com.\n\n79 Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex\n\nEncompassing more than 1.5 million acres, the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex now includes the Bob Marshall, Scapegoat and Great Bear Wilderness areas. The vision for protecting this great swath of mountain country came from Bob Marshall, an early day forester and co-founder of the Wilderness Society. The complex, designated as wilderness in 1964, is now considered one of the most completely preserved mountain ecosystems in the world. It includes rugged mountains ranges, alpine peaks, grassy meadows, fish-heavy streams, large valleys and huge forests. Because of its wilderness designation, the area is not open to motorized traffic. But hikers, backpackers and horse riders all enjoy their trips to the interior. The complex is home to grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, deer, Canada lynx, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears, wolverines and other animals. Access from communities in Gold West Country includes roads near Lincoln, Choteau and Augusta. Plan your visit by visiting www.wilderness.net.\n\nYELLOWSTONE COUNTRY\n\n80 Yellowstone National Park\n\nYes, the majority of Yellowstone National Park actually is in Wyoming, but three of the park's five entry gates are in Montana's Yellowstone Country: Cooke City, Gardiner and West Yellowstone. The country's first national park was established in 1872. Its 2.2 million acres cover a spectacular array of mountains, lakes, rivers and, of course, geysers, mud caldrons and bubbling hot pots. The natural wonders — from wildlife to geography — are as beautiful in winter as in summer. Especially in the Lamar Valley in the northeast corner, visitors are treated to a wide variety of wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, bison, elk and deer. Eagles, falcons and trumpeter swans are among the 303 bird species that make their home in the park.\n\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a popular hot spot for tourists and the site of one of the most picturesque glacial and volcanic aftermaths in the world. Visitors will see house-sized boulders and a more-than-300-foot waterfall from which they can view from an overlook directly above.\n\nEntrance fees are $30 for private vehicle, $25 for motorcycle and $15 for visitors on foot or bicycle. It's open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The park and gateway communities offer lots of accommodations for visitors, but reservations are recommended in the busy tourist seasons. Call 307-344-7381 or visit www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com.\n\n81 West Yellowstone\n\nThe small community of West Yellowstone is a big destination in itself. In the winter, it's known as the Snowmobile Capital of the World — even the local police ride them around town. In summer, it's a busy, busy entranceway to Yellowstone. The town boasts the state's first six-story IMAX theater, with films interpreting the history, wildlife and geothermal activity of Yellowstone Park. Open 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. every day, the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center features live grizzlies and wolves and natural presentations.

As well as the Siebel Dinosaur Complex, the museum houses the Martin Children's Discovery Center, the Taylor Planetarium, Space: A Journey to our Future, Paugh Regional History Hall and the Living History Farm. Three separate halls are dedicated to traveling exhibits. Call 994-2251.\n\n83 Gallatin Gateway\n\nThis community just west of Bozeman was named for being a main gateway to Yellowstone National Park. Even in the 1800s, the area was known for its many dude ranches and tourist opportunities. Many out-of-state visitors boarded at the beautiful Gallatin Gateway Inn in the early part of the century. It was restored to its original splendor in recent years and has regained its fame as one of the finest historic Inns in the region. The palatial structure features arched windows and carved beams. The original railroad clock still keeps accurate time for visitors. The Inn now is home to a fine restaurant that draws customers from around the state. Fly fishing is available in the Madison, Gallatin, and Yellowstone rivers and raft trips are available from several guides in the area.\n\n84 Chico Hot Springs\n\nJust 30 miles north of Yellowstone National Park in the foothills of the Absaroka-Beartooth Mountain range is Chico Hot Springs.

For diners and dippers, this resort has become known for its fine dining and wide array of day spa services. Call 333-4933.\n\n85 Beartooth Scenic Drive\n\nCharles Kuralt called the Red Lodge to Cooke City Beartooth Scenic Highway the \"most scenic drive in America.\" Normally, only mountain climbers get to see the sights on the drive that, since 1936, has taken visitors over the 11,000-foot Beartooth Pass and past hundreds of tiny ponds, as well as lakes situated in glacial depressions. The Beartooth area is one of the highest and most rugged areas in the lower 48 states, with 20 peaks reaching more than 12,000 feet in elevation. Cross-country skiing may be done during June and July.\n\n86 Beartooth Mountains\n\nTalk about big mountains, the Beartooths offer some of the highest elevations in the lower 48 states. Twenty of its peaks are more than 12,000 feet high. The mountain range offers views of glaciers, lakes, forests and abundant wildlife. Much of the range falls within the 900,000-acre Absaroka-Beartooth wilderness. The wilderness area includes hundreds of miles of trails for plenty of hiking, backpacking and cross-country skiing.\n\n87 Yellowstone Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nTake the north entrance to picturesque Red Lodge to find the sanctuary. Formerly called Beartooth Nature Center, it's the only public facility in the state to house native animals that cannot be returned to the wild because of injury or habituation to humans. More than 70 species reside here, many placed by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks. They include wolves, mountain lions, bears, moose, elk, antelope, bobcats, eagles, hawks and others. The center is open to the public from noon to 4 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends, weather permitting, so that visitors can learn about the animals and observe them at close range and through interpretive displays. Call 446-1133.\n\nCUSTER COUNTRY\n\n88 Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument\n\nIn 1876, the U.S. government launched a campaign against Sioux and Cheyenne Indians who refused to be confined within a reservation. Under the spiritual leadership of Sitting Bull, the Indians prepared for battle against the much stronger army. During the preparations, he was said to have conducted a Sun Dance and had a vision of a great victory of the white soldiers. The defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 647 soldiers in the 7th Cavalry is now well known. Custer and his men attacked an Indian village in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. When the bloodshed ended, 263 cavalrymen — including Custer — lay dead. Today, the monument lies within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation and commemorates the battle and the warriors on both sides who fought for their respective nations. Summer park hours are 8 a.m.-8 p.m.; the Visitors Center closes at 7:30 p.m. The 4.5-mile driving tour road and Deep Ravine walking trail close at 8 p.m. Call park headquarters at 638-2621 or visitor information at 638-3214.\n\n89 Pompeys Pillar National Monument\n\nOn his return trip through southern Montana, explorer Capt.

That signature is preserved for the viewing of guests through the national monument designation. Clark named the pillar after Jean Baptiste \"Pomp\" Charbonneau, son of Sacagawea, and her guide husband, Toussaint Charbonneau. The child spent the first year and half of his life on the historic journey. Drive in 9 a.m.-6 p.m. until Labor Day; walk in 365 days a year from dawn to dusk. The Interpretive Center closes the last Saturday in September. Call 406-969-5380.\n\n90 Makoshika State Park\n\nLocated near Glendive, Montana's largest state park is Makoshika at 11,500 acres. To the Sioux Indians, the name meant \"bad earth\" or \"bad land.\" Indeed, much of the pine and juniper-studded park is filled with badland formations. The park also is rich in dinosaur remains, including Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops. A visitor center explains the park's fossils and geologic history. Roads and hiking trails offer visitors a number of routes through which to explore the capstone formations. Visitors also enjoy photography, archery and Frisbee golf. A campground is available, but water is only available May through September. Open daily 10 a.m.-5 p.m. until Labor Day.

The Glendive Chamber of Commerce collects the roe, which is processed in Glendive and shipped to caviar buyers for distribution to exclusive restaurants.\n\n92 Pictograph Cave State Park\n\nA new sandstone-hued interpretive center rises at the foot of the rimrocks at the park's site seven miles southeast of Billings. The site includes three caves, two of which show pictographic evidence of prehistoric hunters dating back about 4,500 years. A short paved trail takes visitors to within view of the rock paintings still visible. Interpretive signs give details. The site is listed as a National Historic Landmark. A detailed archaeological survey in the 1930s and 40s found graves and more than 30,000 artifacts. Summer hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Call 254-7342.\n\n93 Musselshell Valley Historical Museum\n\nNestled in the Musselshell River Valley is Roundup — a cow town if there ever was one. Much of the town's colorful cattle and mining past is captured at the Musselshell Valley Historical Museum. It houses a coal tunnel and memorabilia from early mining days, local Indian artifacts, fossils, restored cowboy and pioneer exhibits, a blacksmith shop and an old ranch home built in the 1880s. New this year is \"Clovis to Coal,\" a display constructed in the rock Room depicting an in-depth history of the geologic Musselshell Valley. Open daily 1-5 p.m. Call 406-323-1525.\n\n94 Miles City\n\nYou know you're Out West when you're in Miles City.

The subterranean waterway near the current River is larger than a football field.\n\n\"It's certainly a source of mystery and intrigue,\" said Cave Research Foundation team leader Tony Schmitt. \"If you look down in there it's an intimidating place, and if you fall in there's no way to get out.\"\n\nThe cavers chose not to interfere with what Mother Nature had set in motion. The land turtle would not survive.\n\n\"No, we didn't rescue it,\" Schmitt said. \"It will eventually provide food for cave fish living there.\"\n\nDevils Well is located about 7 miles southeast east of Akers and is part of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. Visitors can walk down winding stairs to reach a metal platform that offers a glimpse through the small rock opening of the underground lake far below.\n\nThe strange cavern and lake were explored in the 1950s, but it has been many decades since anyone took a scientific look at how the cave and its critters are doing.\n\nOn June 24 and 25 a team of five Cave Research Foundation cavers rigged ropes to a metal platform at the well's entrance and rappelled one-by-one down to the lake 90 feet below. Along with Schmittt, the team included Dan Lamping, Bob Lerch, Mike Tennant and Joe Sikorski.\n\nThe team had three goals: Assess the stability of the viewing platform, document the cave and lake's animal life and prove that modern rappelling gear would safely work for future explorations.\n\nThey wore hard hats and wetsuits to prevent hypothermia from the 56-degree water, and lowered four inflatable rafts and an inner tube to the lake's surface to serve as exploration vehicles.\n\nThey hoped to use snorkeling gear to look for and document aquatic life in the cave but were stymied by low visibility from recent heavy rains.\n\n\"We had a foot of visibility around the edge and about six-foot visibility in the middle,\" he said. \"The water just was not clear enough to do a bio survey.\"\n\nPrevious Devils Well explorers found two species of cave crayfish: the Salem cave crayfish and the rare, blind southern crayfish. Schmitt said a more thorough bio exploration will have to wait for clearer water.\n\n\"The first 20 feet or so you're in a rock shaft, but then as you descend a little farther the walls bellow open and you're dropping into the middle of a big dome,\" Schmitt said. \"You're hanging on a single rope out in space. It can be very intimidating. And once you're on the rope, you're on your own.\"\n\nA small waterfall showered the team all the way down. They brought two-way waterproof radios, but discovered they didn't work well in the cave or with park personnel overseeing the operation at the cave-entrance platform.\n\n\"We found just talking in the cave was difficult,\" Schmitt said. \"We saw four waterfalls and the main one was was really loud and hard to talk over. And our voices echoed real bad in the cave.\"\n\nIt was clear, according to Schmitt, that the lake level can fluctuate significantly. They saw water and debris marks on the cave walls well above head height left behind from recent floods.\n\nAccording to the National Park System, the lake is as much as 80 feet deep in the main chamber, which measures 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Past explorations revealed connecting chambers where the water was at least 135 feet deep, according to Schmitt.\n\nDye tracing has revealed that the water in Devils Well emerges from the ground at Cave Spring, which gushes 24 million gallons a day into the Current River a mile away.\n\nThe team climbed out of Devils Well using a one-way push-pull device attached to the rope. On future forays into Devils Well, Schmitt said he hopes to bring highly trained cave divers to push the boundaries of what's known about the underwater chambers feeding the big lake.\n\n\"This trip into Devils Well was a year in planning and, yes, we fully intend to come back, maybe in a different time of year when the water would be clear,\" Schmitt said.\n\nAccording to park officials, the first known exploration of Devils Well was in 1954 by brothers Bill and Bob Wallace who owned the property. They used using a hand-powered winch attached to steel cable that lowered a person sitting in a metal \"bosun's chair\".\n\nOzark geologist Jerry Vineyard was a cave researcher who was winched into the cave in 1956 and was on hand last week to watch Schmitt's team go into the cave.\n\nNow 80, he well remembers his excursion into Devils Well.\n\n\"Bob and Bill Wallace got hold of a hand-powered winch that turned like the crank on an old ice cream maker,\" he said. \"We didn't have any of the modern gear these guys have. We wore blue jeans, T-shirts and tennis shoes. We had carbide lights on our helmet that was a very primitive way of producing light. We hung a Coleman lantern on a rope about 40 feet down, that helped illuminate the cave, but not very much. It was risky.\"\n\nVineyard said they first lowered a 15-foot aluminum canoe to the lake's surface so they'd have something to step into without getting wet.\n\n\"We wanted to see how big this cave was, what was down there and where it goes,\" he recalled.\n\nThey found two species of blind cave fish in Devils Well and a 6-inch sculpin fish that's normally seen in shallow surface water.\n\n\"How it got into Devils Well, no one knows,\" he said.\n\nLike Schmitt's team, Vineyard said he endured \"a continuous shower of spring water on the way down that was not very fun.\"\n\n\"I wasn't cold — I was too pumped by adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nThe lure of the cave outweighed any thoughts of gear failure or safety concerns, he added. What if the winch cable — their only way out — had snapped?\n\n\"I don't know,\" Vineyard said. We didn't have any plan B. When you're young you usually don't have a plan B.\"\n\nDevils Well, part of Ozark National Scenic Riverways, is located off State Route KK in northern Shannon County. For more information, visit the park's Facebook page, the park's website at www.nps.gov/ozar or phone 573-323-4236.\n\nThere is no admission fee for Devils Well and the area is open seven days a week during daylight hours. There is a light that can be activated by a switch in the stairway leading to the Devils Well opening. Visitors might consider bringing their own flashlight or spotlight, however.\n\nA 4.6 mile hiking trail leads from Devils Well to Cave Spring on the Current River.\n\nIf you're interested in the Devils Well story, check out how two scuba divers pushed their way into the far reaches of Bennett Spring last fall.\n\nContact Outdoors reporter Wes Johnson at 417-836-1243, or wjohnson@news-leader.com.

Yet for 100 years, we have allowed the destructive practice of phosphate mining — just to provide the mineral for fertilizers, detergents and other chemicals.\n\nIn April 2021, the Piney Point phosphate mine began leaking toxic wastewater produced by the mining process. Over 215 million gallons of contaminated water leaked from containment ponds into a Manatee County tributary that flowed into the southern end of Tampa Bay. Two month later, a massive red tide bloomed in Tampa Bay. Were the two events linked by cause and effect? You can bet on it.\n\nProblem is, Piney Point's story is nowhere near its end. In the last few months, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection filed suit to recuperate $46 million spent on emergency contracting services to mitigate the leak, plus over $1 million in fines levied since 2019 for improper management of the containment facility. Most recently, a plan was approved to inject the toxic water more than 2,000 feet into the ground — the same place from where many Floridians draw their drinking water.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nToxic algae blooms\n\nIt's become a rite of summer as reliable as mosquitoes, dumping rainstorms and sweltering heat: the annual turning of green of some inland waterways.\n\nYears of allowing nutrients to flow downstream unchecked into our lakes, canals and rivers have caught up with us to the tune of coating our waters with toxic cyanobacteria, commonly called blue-green algae. Cities are spending money on signs that read \"Don't touch the water\" instead of \"Enjoy our waterways.\"\n\nMost Florida residents will forget all about the green gunk until about May, when the amount of daylight grows long enough to help the algae begin growing. By late June, when the longest day of the year occurs, the algae will be doubling like it's on steroids.\n\nManatee deaths\n\nThe cute, lovable manatee had a year to forget in 2021. A record number of deaths occurred — 1,056 through Dec. 10, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission — with many attributed to starvation. No one wants this story line to continue, but the saddest part is the primary food source for many manatees — seagrasses located in coastal estuaries — still remains scant.\n\nAn emergency supplemental feeding program has been launched, but is it at a scale large enough to help hundreds, or just a handful? This will be a story with a ton of interest within and beyond Florida's state boundaries.\n\nFlorida springs\n\nFlorida's nearly 900 natural springs pump hundreds of millions of gallons of clean freshwater out of the ground. Some form rivers that flow to the Gulf of Mexico. They are a window to Florida's vast and critically important aquifer — the source of 90% of the state's drinking water.\n\nOver the years, however, we have found ways to drain, pollute and reduce their flows to the point where some are little more than just holes in the ground. We are spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars to restore some of the larger magnitude springs. Yet, permits are still doled out to water users who pay pennies to make millions by drawing a natural resource for uses ranging from irrigation of crops to bottling for retail sale.\n\nRed tide\n\nRed tide was first recognized by the early European explorers to Florida, but like the topic of climate change, a debate has raged in recent years arguing how much human influence has exacerbated their frequency and severity.\n\nA severe one in 2021 bloomed during the summer along the beaches of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties as well as much of the west side of Tampa Bay. The visual of a 300-pound goliath grouper, a fish protected from harvest since 1990, being lifted by a backhoe into a trash dumpster drew the ire of environmentalists who blamed the tide's fury on the recent Piney Point spill.\n\nHurricane season\n\nFor the second time in as many years, and third since 2005, the hurricane season found its way into the Greek alphabet. The good news is Florida kids have learned several letters in the ancient language. Bad news is this is becoming too common.\n\nA study released Nov. 22 blames climate change and says even the northeastern U.S. will see more monster storms arrive more quickly, but slow down once they’ve made landfall.\n\nUnchecked development\n\nResidential and non-residential construction in Florida in 2019 was a $58.7 billion industry generating over 154,000 building permits, according to the Association of General Contractors of America. That won't slow down as Florida's population is projected to reach 26 million by 2030, according to the Florida Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThat means more water will be needed, while more garbage, more sewage and more roads will be produced. Disappearing land means that panthers and bears may join the manatees as Florida icons needing to be fed in order to survive.\n\nEd Killer is TCPalm's outdoors writer.

Treat the intersection as a four-way stop if you are approaching a traffic signal that is not operating. Traffic from all four directions must STOP. USE EXTRA CAUTION, as road conditions may not be what you're used to.\"\n\nThe Citizens Information Center is available for questions at 866-345-0345. People can also go to Volusia.org/PIN for information.\n\n10:45 p.m. | Daytona Beach officials still conducting Hurricane Ian flood rescues\n\nOn Thursday morning and afternoon, much of Daytona Beach looked more like Lake Daytona. With floodwaters still lingering, rescue efforts are going strong, city officials said Thursday night.\n\nOfficers are out in force, using large trucks and boats to rescue people from flooded areas.\n\n\"We are making our way to get everyone that has called for help,\" city officials said on their Facebook page Thursday night. \"Please be patient, we will be to you soon! In the meantime, please stay off the roads and avoid all standing water. It’s dangerous and honestly, pretty nasty. If you need rescuing, you can call our EOC at 386-671-5555.\"\n\nThe city of Daytona Beach is also asking residents to limit nonessential use of water. Rainfall has inundated the city’s sewer system, officials say. Treatment plants and about 60 lift stations are running at a limited capacity because of power outages.\n\nDaytona Beach remains under a curfew through 7 a.m. Friday.\n\n10:15 p.m. | More than 114,000 in Volusia County still without power from Hurricane Ian\n\nAs of 10 p.m. Thursday, Florida Power & Light is reporting that 114,970 of Volusia County's total 191,950 FPL customers are still without power. The company shows on its website that 35,590 Volusia County customers have had their power restored.\n\nFPL is also reporting that 380 of Flagler County's total 66,910 FPL customers are still without power. The company shows on its website that 80 Flagler County customers have had their power restored.\n\nThat appears to be an error because Florida Power & Light's website stated that as of 7 p.m. Thursday there were 46,130 customers without power out of a total customer count of 66,910 in Flagler County.\n\n9:10 p.m. | Ponce Inlet digging out from Hurricane Ian damage\n\nPonce Inlet’s emergency personnel labored throughout Thursday afternoon and into the evening to clear the small beach town's roadways. As of about 7:30 p.m. all roads were passable, but town officials warned that there could be hazards that develop overnight from saturated trees.\n\nThe Volusia County sheriff’s curfew is still in effect until 7 a.m. Friday. The Dunlawton Bridge remains closed, although it's expected to open at some point Friday morning. Ponce Inlet officials will announce the bridge reopening when it occurs.\n\nCleanup efforts in Ponce Inlet will resume Friday morning. The plan is to open town offices as soon as employees can get there.\n\nTown officials will initiate a comprehensive damage assessment, working through Saturday.\n\n8:45 p.m. | Hurricane Ian churned up waves that crashed through dunes just north of Flagler County line\n\nHurricane Ian churned up waves which sent the Atlantic Ocean crashing through dunes just inside St. Johns County north of the Flagler County line, according to Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly.\n\nStaly said the breach was 50 or maybe 100 feet north of the Flagler County line.\n\n\"The ocean water breached the dune up there and was coming across A1A,\" Staly said. \"Of course, the sand from the dunes was across A1A up there.\"\n\nWater also filled the parking lot at the Whitney Lab in Marineland, a tiny town which straddles the Flagler-St. Johns county line.\n\n\"All of that parking lot was underwater, lapping at the building and then it was about to breach A1A from that side,\" Staly said. \"It was close enough that it wouldn't take much more water to breach there.\"\n\nStaly said that while A1A was passable in the Marineland area, he did not recommend driving through there due to the sand and the water.\n\nThe ocean also breached the dunes in the area of Washington Oaks State Park.\n\n\"From what I could tell there was no damage to A1A,\" he said.\n\nAnother hard-hit place was the Mondex, an area which is also known as Daytona North in western Flagler County.\n\nStaly said a lot of homes in the Mondex are now surrounded by water. He said he saw one resident who had to park his car at the entrance of their driveway and then walk through 12-15 inches of water to get to their front door.\n\n\"Roads out there are flooded. It’s bad in the Mondex,\" Staly said\n\nHe said he anticipates the flooding around the county will get worse as the rain continues.\n\nStaly said his home is off Crescent Lake, where the water is now two-thirds to his house. He said his house is on pilings.\n\n\"It’s not going to affect me, but I’ve never seen the water this high and this close to my house before,\" Staly said.\n\nBut on the positive side, Staly said there had been no reports of injuries or deaths due to the storm.\n\nStaly also mentioned the damage to the Flagler Beach pier.\n\n\"It’s unfortunate because it’s kind of an iconic pier for Flagler Beach,\" Staly said. \"It’s one of the few remaining wooden piers.\"\n\nHe said the curfew was in effect again tonight from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. and would be reassessed tomorrow.\n\nHe said that there are still many people without power and that would be a factor on whether to continue the curfew or not.\n\nFlorida Power & Light's website stated that as of 7 p.m. Thursday there were 46,130 customers without power out of a total customer count of 66,910 in Flagler County.\n\nHe recommended that people stay home and not drive around to look at the damage.\n\n\"There's lots of roads that have flooding,\" Staly said. \"State Road 100 has areas that’s flooded, in some cases very deep. My recommendation to the community is stay at home, minimize your trips right now until we start the recovery process. Hopefully that'll be tomorrow.\"\n\nHe said an area on State Road 100 near the Bimini Bar west of Bunnell is very treacherous with at least 10 inches of standing water.\n\n\"It did the same kind of damage. I saw powerlines down, I saw street signs missing, I saw siding off of homes, shingles missing off of roofs as I was surveying the community today,\" Staly said. \"So, it may not have been an official hurricane but we certainly had some of the results of a hurricane.\"\n\n8:20 p.m. | Hurricane Ian brings 'almost epic' amount of floodwater to Daytona's Beach Street\n\nDaytona's Beach Street has a 100-year history of flooding during major storms, but jewelry store owner Al Brewer still had hopes Thursday that the riverfront corridor had been spared the worst Hurricane Ian had to mete out.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\n\"It was almost epic the amount of water,\" said Brewer, owner of Evans & Son Jewelers on Beach Street near Orange Avenue.\n\nHe said the floodwater extended up to Ridgewood Avenue, making all the side streets connecting to Beach Street also impassable.\n\nOn Beach Street, the water flow looked like a river.\n\n\"There were waves,\" he said.\n\nBrewer said the floodwater at Orange and Palmetto avenues was up to cars' windshields.\n\nBrewer was hoping the new seawall and storm sewer pipes in Riverfront Park would help ease water rise, but they were no match for Ian. He said the water rose at least 6 inches along the front of his building.\n\nBrewer lives in Ormond Beach about four blocks south of the Granada Bridge, and when the weather calmed down for a while in the afternoon he got in his large pickup truck and headed south on Beach Street.\n\n\"I made it three blocks and then it was flooded,\" he said. \"Trees were down everywhere.\n\nHe had to shift over to U.S. Highway 1, and eight of the 10 intersections he drove through had traffic lights that weren't working. He also saw trees strewn across U.S. 1.\n\nOnce he was downtown, he tried every path he could think of to get to his shop: International Speedway Boulevard, Orange Avenue, the rear parking lot, Magnolia Avenue. Nothing worked.\n\n\"In 45 years that's the first time I didn't make it to my building,\" Brewer said.\n\nHe's hoping by Friday morning the water will have receded enough for him to check out his shop.\n\nHe's not worried about the floodwater creeping up into his business since it's one of the few Beach Street stores that has its first floor a few feet above the sidewalk. But he still wants to check for other types of damage and make sure everything is secure.\n\n7:09 p.m. | Hurricane Ian is already worse than 'a 100-year storm event' for rain, and it's not over\n\nVolusia County officials are urging people to stay in a safe place and avoid traveling because roads aren't safe amid widespread flooding and damage, and more wind and rain are expected as Hurricane Ian's outer bands hit the area, according to a county news release.\n\nVolusia County Public Works Director Ben Bartlett said Hurricane Ian has already been an unprecedented storm for rainfall in Volusia County.\n\n“A 100-year storm event is roughly 11 inches of rain over a 24-hour period,” Bartlett said. “Ian just dropped more than double that amount across Volusia County. Do not take the risk driving into a flooded area, turn around, don’t drown.”\n\nVolusia County is under both a tropical storm warning and a flood warning. Officials expect 1 to 3 more inches of rainfall tonight with tropical storm-force winds still possible.\n\nCounty officials also urged people to observe the following safety advice:\n\nStanding water, downed trees and other debris make roads dangerous and impassible. Public works crews will start conducting assessments and cleaning after the storm has passed. Staying off roads helps create a safer working environment for emergency crews.\n\nIf people have to be on the road, drivers should remember that some traffic signals might not be working. When approaching an intersection where the traffic light isn’t working, it should be treated as a four-way stop.\n\nOcean currents and waves are extremely dangerous right now, and people should not go in the water.\n\nPeople should assume a downed power line is live and should not touch it or go near it.\n\nPeople should never use a generator indoors or outside near windows, vents or air intakes that could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors. This could be fatal. Also, proper ventilation is critical to reducing the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator’s engine exhaust. And when using one, people should be sure to maintain plenty of air flow space around the generator.\n\n5:24 p.m. | Part of Flagler Beach pier torn off in Tropical Storm Ian\n\nTropical Storm Ian tore off the end of the Flagler Beach pier, carrying away some history for the many who fished or simply took a walk on the iconic wooden pier.\n\nIan became the latest storm to batter the pier. Hurricane Irma damaged the pier in 2017.\n\nAnd the year before Irma, Hurricane Matthew tore off 160 feet from the pier’s end. The damage from Matthew closed the pier for more than eight months and cost the city $917,917 to repair.\n\nNow, whether it will ever reopen again is a question since Flagler Beach was already in the process of replacing the wooden pier with a concrete one. Plans called for the wooden pier to be closed next year and taken down to make way for its concrete replacement.\n\nPeople were braving the wind and rain on Thursday to snap pictures and take videos of the damage. Some snapped selfies of themselves with the damaged pier in the background.\n\nThe damage was apparently discovered Thursday by a Flagler Beach police officer.\n\nIt was a somber occasion for Felix Coffman, 57, of Palm Coast.\n\nCoffman said he has lived in the area since the early 60s. He occasionally fished at the pier and caught a variety of fish, including redfish, cobia and sharks.\n\n“It’s sad to see it, you know. This has been here a long time. I’ve been here a long time. It’s been here since before I was here,” Coffman said.\n\n“It’s always sad to see a landmark get tore up,” Coffman said.\n\nTom Hoffman,65, who is a part-time resident of Flagler Beach, said he fished at the pier every year he comes down from Ohio.\n\n“It’s a great fishing spot,” Hoffman said. “It’s kind of sad the way the pier is getting tore up and the end’s been tore off again. Who knows what’s going to happen from here.”\n\nHoffman said the old wooden pier had sentimental value but maybe now this damage will speed up its planned replacement by a concrete pier. ― Frank Fernandez\n\n4:57 p.m. | Volusia County officials urge people to stay home\n\nVolusia County officials are still urging residents to stay off the roads as rescue crews continue their operations throughout the flooded cities.\n\n“Property and material possessions can be replaced, but your life cannot,” said Kevin Captain, community information director for the county, at an afternoon press conference at the Emergency Operations Center in Daytona Beach. “Over the last few hours, you may have noticed a slight decrease in both the intensity of the rain and the wind; however, officials anticipate another round of rainfall late this evening extending into the early hours of tomorrow.”\n\nMany roads have high water levels, “making driving conditions impossible or extremely dangerous.”\n\nCity managers countywide are reporting widespread flooding, Captain said.\n\nThe Daytona Beach International Airport remains closed, Captain said, while reports of flooding at the Daytona International Speedway have not yet been confirmed.\n\nAs of 1 p.m. on Thursday, 361 residents sought assistance from county shelters — an increase from the morning count of around 300.\n\n“We are aware some residents will be displaced from their homes as a result of the storm,” he said. “We are coordinating efforts with the American Red Cross and other community partners to establish temporary housing arrangements for these citizens.”\n\nThe county is also working on providing these residents long-term shelter assistance.\n\nAs of 2 p.m., more than 247,000 Volusia County customers are currently without power.\n\nLinda Webster-Dubea, regional manager for Florida Power & Light, said at the press conference that the company is trying to restore power “as safely and as quickly as possible.”\n\n“Crews have been working and will continue to work around the clock to restore service,” Dubea said. “We have mobilized 37 staging, parking and processing sites to support this effort.”\n\nVolusia County Emergency Management Director Jim Judge said the good news is that Tropical Storm Ian is moving off the coast, but it will continue to produce additional gusts later in the afternoon and evening.\n\n“We can expect an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain tonight,” Judge said.\n\nTomorrow and over the next few days, Judge added, “we are going to have drier conditions.”\n\n“Temperatures are going to be in the 80s and possibly down into the 60s at night, so much better weather ahead,” Judge said. “And we are hoping the water will subside and we can get back out there again.”\n\nFire rescue, beach safety and other first responders are still in the “response mode,” Judge said, adding that “as we move forward, we are going to get into the recovery phase, and that’s still a day or two away.”\n\nJudge encouraged residents to continue monitoring the county’s storm information as it leaves the area.\n\nFor updates, visit volusia.org/pin or call the Citizens’ Information Center at 866-345-0345.\n\nResources for displaced residents include the American Red Cross at redcross.org and FEMA’s website at ready.gov. ― Brenno Carillo\n\n4:36 p.m. | Tropical Storm Ian flooding causes washout in Deltona\n\nA deluge of water caused a washout on Gatewood Drive in Deltona between Branchville Drive and Lynnhaven Street, Deltona officials confirmed shortly before 4 p.m. Thursday.\n\nChris Reed, a lifelong resident of the West Volusia County area, recorded a video Thursday morning of the heavily flooded area and posted it on Facebook. The video had a few thousand views by the afternoon.\n\nA few miles north of Reed, near the intersection of Fifer Drive and Beckwith Street, resident Dena Ingram looked outside her parent's home and saw Thursday what she described as \"a raging river.\" ― Katie Kustura\n\n4:22 p.m. | Tipsy Taco sign goes down in Tropical Storm Ian\n\nStrong wind gusts from Tropical Storm Ian toppled the pole sign for the beachside Tipsy Taco Cantina restaurant at 746 S. Atlantic Ave. in Ormond Beach on Thursday.\n\nOwner Michael Lucas who lives four blocks away made the discovery at 1:30 p.m., when he decided it was finally safe enough to venture from his home to check on the restaurant.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure the building was secure and that the power was still on,\" he said, noting that he lost power at his home.\n\nLucas was relieved to find the restaurant's electrical system running and that the refrigerator was still on.\n\n\"I have a lot of perishables that would have had to be thrown out if the restaurant had lost power,\" he explained.\n\n\"We plan to reopen Tipsy Taco tomorrow (Friday) at noon,\" he said, adding, \"All in all, it could've been a lot worse.\"\n\nLucas wasn't so lucky when he went to check on the other beachside restaurant he owns: the Big Tunas Bar & Grill down the road at the Bellair Plaza Shopping Center in Daytona Beach.\n\nHe found the shopping center's parking lot completely flooded and that his restaurant there had lost power.\n\n\"Lost power (but) no visible damage so far,\" he wrote in a text message shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nLucas said he hoped to reopen Big Tunas on Saturday, \"if we get power restored.\" ― Clayton Park\n\n4:05 p.m. | Daytona Army vet rescues woman from flooded car\n\nDaytona Beach residents Liz and Richard Callahan were surprised to see a woman trapped in her car in the rising flood waters caused by Tropical Storm Ian in front of their home near the intersection of Nova and Beville roads on Thursday morning around 10:30.\n\n\"My husband is an Army veteran and immediately went into action to rescue her,\" said Liz Callahan, the owner of Liz Callahan Studio Sessions Salon.\n\nFortunately, the woman, who lives a few blocks away from the Callahans, was successfully extracted from the car and is now back in her home, according to Liz Callahan.\n\n\"She was frantic. Her home had lost power and she was trying to get to her boyfriend's house in Palm Coast,\" she said.\n\nThe floodwaters at the time of the woman's rescue were waist-high deep and have since risen even more, said Liz Callahan, who said as of mid-afternoon her and her husband's home remained high and dry even though it lost power on Wednesday night. The couple have a generator.\n\n\"The (woman's) car is still sitting in front of my house,\" Liz Callahan reported.\n\nRichard Callahan is currently a student at the International Academy where he is studying to become a barber. ― Clayton Park\n\n3:35 p.m. | Edgewater reports about 25 Tropical Storm Ian rescues\n\nThe city of Edgewater announced in a press release Thursday afternoon that many of the city’s streets have “some level of flooding and some are impassable at this time.”\n\nCity spokesperson Jill Danigel reminded residents that driving pushes the water into nearby homes and urged them to stay put.\n\n“The city’s fire and police departments have use of several high clearance vehicles,” Danigel said. “At this time they are being used to access residents experiencing serious medical emergencies. Approximately 25 rescues from homes or flooded vehicles have been made through the combined efforts of Edgewater Police and Fire Rescue Departments.”\n\nDanigel added that “all stormwater drainage systems and major drainage canals are functioning and clear of obstructions but are inundated by the tremendous amount of rainfall.”\n\nThe city’s fire rescue crews have responded to 106 incidents since the storm began. They are taking residents who have evacuated due to medical concerns to the New Smyrna Beach City Gym at 1000 Live Oak St.\n\n“Crews from all city departments continue to conduct damage assessment throughout the community and of city infrastructure and facilities,” Danigel said. “Due to standing water and continuing high winds, it is not safe for crews to begin clearing blocked roadways.― Brenno Carillo\n\n3:29 p.m. | Beach Street business owner reports flooding\n\nA few Beach Street business owners said early Thursday afternoon that so far the flooding hasn't been catastrophic, but they're waiting to see what happens when high tide comes in at 3 p.m.\n\nAl Brewer, owner of Evans & Son Jewelers on the Daytona riverfront, said he hadn't been to his shop yet but was relieved to hear that so far the water rise is mostly minimal.\n\n\"I think the new $3 million seawall and the newly raised elevation of the park helped,\" Brewer said.\n\nHe said he did hear from other downtown business owners that a few side roads were flooding.\n\nBrewer noted that he saw pictures of flooding in front of Holly Hill City Hall on Ridgewood Avenue that appeared to be 3 feet deep.\n\nTim Minnig, owner of the Davidson Brothers shop on Beach Street that sells citrus fruit and gourmet gifts, said early Thursday afternoon that the water had gotten as high as 4 inches on the side of his building.\n\n\"It was 5 or 6 inches earlier,\" Minnig said. \"It's flowing south now.\"\n\nHe said earlier Thursday the raised median on Beach Street was under water. But the water is still high enough that he said he was dreading the people who will drive past his business too quickly and push water toward his small first-floor shop.\n\nHe's been nervous because nearly every business on Beach Street from Orange Avenue to Fairview Avenue flooded in 2017 when Hurricane Irma blew through. Only the small handful of buildings raised above street level escaped water intrusion, he said.\n\nHis shop was swimming in 2 feet of water. But he said the water receded quickly after Hurricane Irma passed by so he was able to get the water out quickly and minimize damage to his flooring and walls.\n\nJ. Hyatt Brown said his new Brown & Brown insurance company office tower on Beach Street that's raised 8 feet above the street appears to be fine. There was some water intrusion on the 10th and 11th floors, Brown said.\n\nHe said he heard that at about 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. Thursday water was spilling over the Halifax River seawall and flowing onto the east side of Beach Street.\n\nBrown and his wife donated tens of millions of dollars to remake Riverfront Park with everything from new landscaping to swings and benches to plazas. He said a few trees in the park were topped by the wind, but the ranger station building seems to have escaped any water intrusion. ― Eileen Zaffiro-Kean\n\n3:13 p.m. | Daytona Beach Shores residents ride out storm, describe Tropical Storm Ian damage\n\nAs Ian approached the state on Wednesday, Debra Smith and her husband, Doug, were in awe of their bird’s eye view of twisting palm trees and snarling surf from their 21st-floor unit at the landmark Peck Plaza in Daytona Beach Shores.\n\nA day later, as hurricane force gusts continued a destructive 24-hour assault the beachside, the Smiths had seen enough.\n\n“This storm is a beast,” Debra said. “This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nFrom the couple’s 21st-floor vantage point, they have watched in horror as Ian’s relentless rain and winds left a deep hole in the concrete swimming pool deck at the neighboring Holiday Shores Beach Resort timeshare and hotel, just to the north on Atlantic Avenue.\n\nAt Peck Plaza, the pounding surf tore apart the condominium’s steps from its outside deck to the beach, pushed ocean water into the ground-floor parking garage and tossed sand over the condo's sea wall to coat the tennis courts outside.\n\nThe public beach access ramp south of the tower is now littered with the debris of docks washed away from oceanfront homes farther south on State Road A1A, Smith said.\n\n“I’m on 21st floor, so I can see all those fancy houses to the south of me along the beach, and every one of their docks are torn up,” she said. “A lot of them are gone. One is just hanging on, all collapsed and broken up.”\n\nAlthough the Smiths’ unit on the southeast side of the tower sustained no damage, water is seeping through newly installed sliders in units on the northeastern part of the building, she said.\n\n“No windows are broken, because the building has 200-mph (wind resistant) windows, but when you have sliders that open and you’re having 90 mph gusts and nonstop rain for 14 hours, it’s going to happen,” she said.\n\nThe Smiths rode out hurricanes Irma and Dorian on Daytona’s beachside, but Ian has been the most frightening experience yet, Debra said.\n\n“Unless you’ve lived through one of these things, you have no idea what the sound is like,” she said. “It’s like there’s a ghost that’s sitting in a creaking rocking chair. That, on top of the sound of the wind. It's a scary storm and I cringe at what it’s done to the other side of the state, if this is what we’re taking, this kind of beating.” ― Jim Abbott\n\n3:06 p.m. | Flagler Beach pier damaged\n\nIn Flagler Beach, county emergency officials reported damage to the end of the pier as a result of the high and pounding surf on Thursday, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said.\n\nThe public reported the surf was tossing erosion control rocks over the beachside highway State Road A1A.

On at least one occasion, part of a tree landed on a resident’s car.\n\nThe heavy rains elevated the level of the St. Johns River about a foot higher than Raburn had anticipated, but it didn’t threaten any structures, he said.\n\nOutside the park, the winds also toppled a tree that blocked Highbanks Road west of the railroad tracks that run next to DeBary’s Rob Sullivan Park, Raburn said.\n\n“Until they clean that up, nobody’s going to be able to get to the marina, at least on Highbanks,” he said. ― Jim Abbott\n\n8:54 a.m. | Palm Coast asks residents to limit water usage\n\nPalm Coast is asking residents “to limit water usage as much as possible for the next few days” in hopes of preventing flooding, according to a release.\n\nThe city’s wastewater system is already having to handle plenty of water from the storm and heavy rainfall is expected through Friday evening, Brittany Kershaw, the city’s director of communications, wrote in an email.\n\nThe water could overwhelm the city’s wastewater system and cause a flood.\n\n“Any water that goes down the drain creates wastewater that further stresses the wastewater system,” Kershaw wrote.\n\nThe request applies to properties with or without PEP tanks.\n\n“Any water that goes down the drain will contribute to our wastewater system which is already overwhelmed with a great deal of rainwater,” Utility Director Steve Flanagan stated in the press release.\n\nThe city also provided flood safety tips:\n\nDo not walk-through standing water or play in it, including swales.

Boylan’s plan was to make a quick stop in Key West – “just a bump and run” – to pick up one more crew member, and then head out across the Gulfstream to Marina Hemingway in Cuba.\n\nMore:Havana day-dreaming: Marco Islanders set sail for Cuba\n\nBoylan, along with a boat, a 1985 Endeavor sloop with 33 ft. overall (LOA) and 27 ft., 6 in. at the waterline, (LWL) is part owner of the Speakeasy restaurant on Marco Island.\n\nBelow is a follow-up to that report, from Boylan himself.\n\nAlso of note: On Friday, June 16, President Donald Trump, speaking from Miami, restored many of the travel limits to Cuba that had been lifted by the previous administration.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nSkipper Jimmy Boylan, age 63, owner of The Speakeasy of Marco Island, 10 years sailing experience.\n\nJohnny Gantz, age 65, licensed 100-ton captain, many years sailing experience with several Atlantic crossings.\n\nBilly Hanson, age 67, engineer and hand, many years sailing experience.\n\nPatrick “Boe” Cibula, age 68, many years sailing experience, owner of “Docs Beach House.”\n\nBobby Nash, age 54 years, bartender at Quinn’s on the beach, Marriott Marco Island, deck hand and celestial navigator.\n\nOUR STORY\n\nWe originally planned to sail on Thursday, May 18, and spend two nights in Key West at Conch Harbor Marina. The plan was to meet Billy and Boe in Key West after a wedding they had attended and depart for Marina Hemingway on Sunday, May 21.\n\nWeather quickly became an issue and nightly delays became a reality; 25-knot winds from the southeast across the Florida Bay would be intolerable and, as often happens in sailing, delays became the nightly decision.\n\nWe finally departed on Sunday, May 21, from Anglers Cove Marina at 1845 hrs. Billy joined us for this leg of the journey and we planned to pick up Boe in Key West.\n\nWith winds out of the southeast at 18 to 20 knots and four- to six-foot seas it was a pleasant sail. We travelled at five to six knots with the mainsail trimmed into the wind. The sky was a blanket of stars with a sliver of a moon.\n\nWe took turns resting, always leaving at least two on deck. We did not maintain a watch schedule but slept at will and kept two up top with no problem. Weather conditions wreaked havoc on Bob’s attempt at celestial navigation but we ended up arriving at Key West just 5.8 nautical miles west of the Northwest Channel, our goal.\n\nWe dropped the sails and motored into the very long channel into Key West. We arrived at Conch Harbor at 1545 hours. Boe Cibula joined us in Key West and we all enjoyed dinner at Pepe’s and a few drinks before retiring to bed early. Bob and I stayed on the boat, retiring before 11 p.m. and the others got rooms in town.\n\nAfter breakfast we restocked the boat and sat down for a couple beers. We departed Conch Harbor at 1345 hours with a destination of Marina Hemingway. The wind was out of the southeast at 18 to 20 knots and seas were in the 5-7 foot range. It was a pleasant sail with warm breezes and no rain.\n\nWe did get a rare spray into the cockpit. We let out a lure, a “Tuna Treat” on the rod and reel that Wisconsin Jerry had given me for the trip. He had also provided the lure. At about 8 p.m. we caught a five or six pound Bonita. We got him off the hook and returned him to the sea.\n\nOnce again our navigation landed us approximately 20 nautical miles east of our destination but none of the crew complained. As the sun rose we found ourselves sailing west at seven knots passing the El Morro Castle guarding Havana Harbor and the downtown skyline! It was very beautiful and the sail was remarkable as we had a 25 knot wind directly out of the south while heading directly west – known in sailing as a beam reach! We were healed over and had the gunnels in the water – a great time! We arrived at Marina Hemingway at 1100 hours.\n\nWe had to check in with customs. A yellow quarantine flag is raised indicating that the boat and occupants have to undergo an interview and search process. Once the health inspectors determined that we carried nothing harmful and after taking our temperatures we were instructed to take down the quarantine flag and raise the Cuban flag. We then proceeded to Customs and Immigration.\n\nThe Cuban officials were very interested in any possession of guns, drones, bicycles and satellite phones. When it was determined that we possessed none of these items our passports were collected and we marched two at a time into the immigration office to be photographed and visas issued. We then proceeded to the harbor masters office at Marina Hemingway where I signed an agreement of payment and was advised of the charges.\n\nWith the exception of the young guardia who handled our immigration procedure, everyone we dealt with was happy to receive gifts of beers and 10 or 20 dollar bills. We sailed through the process in about one and one half hours.\n\nOnce checked in and after securing the vessel our drivers drove us to private residences, known as “Casa Particulars,” where we would stay during our time in Havana. Actually Marina Hemingway is located in Jaimanitas and our rooms were in Santa Fe, both just outside Havana. The rooms were nice and clean and air conditioned. The shower felt like heaven after a long nights sail!\n\nOur drivers, Carlos and Nelson, both speak fluent English, have their own cars and are experts on the history and geography of Cuba. They are also great friends of ours and had made all of the arrangements for us. Marina Hemingway was waiting for us and had a slip reserved for us! It’s great to have friends in foreign places.\n\nAfter showering the guys drove us to Santi’s, a small restaurant on the second floor of a dilapidated old building overlooking a dilapidated old harbor that had the best ceviche you have ever had! The octopus was just as tasty and, after devouring several portions of each, we were fully sated and ready for the yacht club.\n\nClub Nautico, the Marina Hemingway Yacht Club, rests on the grounds of one of the most famous marinas in the world. They sponsor regattas, 22 this year at the time of our arrival, and fishing tournaments, with the Marina Hemingway Marlin Tournament starting on Tuesday.\n\nTwo of our crew were members and myself, Bobby and John joined the club on this trip. The yacht club is small but very comfortable with strong air conditioning, a fully stocked bar, big stuffed chairs and couches and a flat screen television, comforts rarely seen in Havana!\n\nThe bar has a single bartender and they never closed while we were in house! They were very accommodating! One evening I sat there all evening drinking rum and watching the Cubs, I stayed on the boat a short walk from the club that night!\n\nSeveral days we had the guys drive us into Old Havana. Between personal observations of our crew and discussion with Carlos and Nelson, it was observed that the American influence is in Cuba. Prices have increased by 150 percent since the changes in U.S. policy. Rental cars that were $150 a day are now over $250 and none are available. The bars are now full of Americans, especially if a cruise ship is in town. There was actually a line formed to get pictures taken with the Earnest Hemingway statue in La Floridita, a bar that he frequented.\n\nThe old cars were beaters belching black kerosene smoke in years past. A taxi ride to the restaurant in a 1957 Chevy might cost $5-$8, now the cars are painted and restored, burning clean fuel and charging $50 an hour per person to ride on the Malecón! The Malecón is the Lake Shore Drive of Havana. It travels along the coast and can be closed when high waves swamp the roadway. At sun down people swarm to the walls and smoke cigars, enjoy a drink, or just look out to sea. It is a popular spot for lovers.\n\nHavana is safe! If it is your first visit you will be surprised! Many Americans suffer the belief that the Cuban people dislike the American people – quite the opposite is true! The Cuban people can’t understand why more Americans don’t visit their country – well that is changing! Cuba is a police state, there are no guns. I am not saying that you cannot put yourself in harms way – just use common sense and stay to the beaten path and you will never feel threatened and there is no need for alarm.\n\nOne afternoon we had lunch at La Bodeguita del Medio, a famous Cuban bar and restaurant that was frequented by Errol Flynn, Earnes Hemingway, and the other rich and famous frequenting Old Havana. There are even Cuban songs about the place.\n\nWe were taken to a small room on the second floor. As we passed one room a band was playing and they were rocking, I was disappointed that we had to be in a different room.\n\nOnce seated mojitos were ordered and delivered promptly and they were mas fuerte (very strong)! We were then offered menus and basically just ordered an assortment of entrees with black beans and rice. The food proved to be delicious and the service was great.\n\nThere were three women at the table next to us – they were from Milwaukee, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. After they left a dozen young men came into the room – it was crowded! Then one of the band members told me they were coming to our room next – where would they set up?\n\nThe band entered the room and set up along a wall next to me. Another group of six entered the room and stood on the balcony. The music started and it was terrific. When they finished and exited the room Bobby told me that it was the most fun he had ever had in a small room with 28 guys and few chicks.\n\nI purchased their CD before leaving the restaurant. We tried to purchase serving trays with the Bodeguita emblem but they would not sell them – America has not got them quite yet.\n\nEverywhere you go in Havana music breaks out. Stop for a drink or a bite to eat and a band or wandering minstrels will be playing Guantanamera in short order! Give them a buck or two!\n\nBack at the marina we learned that a large marlin had been caught by a young Canadian girl and had been half eaten by a shark – we went to investigate. We found the remains of what they estimated was a 250 lb. blue marlin. We took pictures and video of them cutting the fish into huge steaks for consumption. They related that while bringing in the fish it was bitten in half by a Cuban Night Shark. We googled it yes they exist.\n\nWe then returned to the yacht club for cocktails and two troubadour’s, one playing a guitar and one playing a fiddle, entertained us for the entire evening. Cuba Libre’s flowed and a good time was had by all.\n\nWe had been watching the weather and fisherman awaiting the tournament had been discussing the north winds that were expected on Tuesday. We did not need north winds and decided to leave Sunday afternoon under cover of nice east winds.\n\nCarlos invited us for lunch and on Sunday we feasted on shrimp kabobs, pork, chicken and plantains. The balance of the food, enough to feed an army, was packaged up for our return trip. Upon returning to The Speakeasy I found that the food took up all of our refrigeration space and I promptly gave it to one of the marina guards. It would be a short overnight passage and juices and cocktails took priority. I would soon regret that decision!\n\nWe checked out at the marina paying our bill, shaking hands, giving away Cuban cigars, and some currency, to our hosts. We encountered the same young guardia that had checked us into the country and, after an hour or so we were underway, leaving Marina Hemingway at 1540 hours. Our destination – Key West!\n\nThe water drops off dramatically as soon as you depart the harbor and we had the sails up and were under sail minutes after departure. I tossed our lure into the water and let out about 200 feet of line and we were underway. To our dismay the wind was out of the northeast, our intended destination, so we sailed to the northwest and motored along. We could always change direction and motor into Key West as needed or, hopefully, the wind would shift.\n\nAbout 45 minutes out of the marina our fishing reel began to sing as line was drawn out rapidly. Bobby was nearest the rod and began to set the hook and reel in our catch. It appeared that we had lost our fish as the line went limp – looking back we think he was swimming toward the boat. The reel sprung to life and went limp again and again. When we were convinced we had something on the line I put the engine in neutral and turned into the wind to slow down the vessel.\n\nBobby was feverishly manning the reel and reported that he could see the fish behind the boat. We all turned our attention to the stern and 30 to 50 feet astern saw a marlin jump from the water twice, the second time spitting out the lure and heading to open seas. We saw it clear as day – we all did – it had to be 6 feet or longer – a real beauty! John said, “Men doing manly things” as he and I sucked on Cohiba Behike cigars and high fives were exchanged. This made our day!\n\nWe continued motor sailing and our northwestern route was taking us off course but not a concern at that point. About three hours out of Marina Hemingway the alarm on the engine sounded indicating engine overheating. We immediately shut down the engine to cool it off. We had been healing hard to port in the northeast wind and I hoped that the water intake had been exposed to air causing the overheating – this was not to be!\n\nI checked the sea strainer and it was relatively clean and water was flowing. It was now getting dark, in a bumpy ride, and it was insanely hot in the engine room, I decided to put off further repairs until daylight.\n\nAbout 10 p.m. the fishing reel began to sing again – John and myself took turns reeling it in with similar results we had experienced earlier with the marlin. The final result was that the reel began singing and spinning and then popped loudly leaving no line on the reel – we can only imagine what sort of beast was on that line! I then turned in for some rest!\n\nI had not quite fallen asleep when I heard Bobby stating that the wind had died and the motor needed to be started. I told them to let me check the belts and pumps first to not hazard further damage to the engine. My nap had ended!\n\nBelts fine, strainer clear, it’s time to start taking things apart. The first hose I removed was the supply hose to the raw water sea pump. This is the pump that pumps cool seawater through the engine to cool it. No water was coming through the hose! Problem detected.\n\nI examined the flow of the hoses and learned that the hose first feeds the ships refrigeration system and then the engine. I cut loose the refrigeration and installed a direct feed to the engine. Next I disassembled the raw water sea pump to examine the impellor. As expected it had been compromised and one blade was broken off and luckily wedged in the outlet of the pump housing – it had not gotten into the engine. Also I had stocked the vessel with replacement parts and had an impellor. I replaced it with Billy’s help.\n\nIt was now 3 a.m. and I was drenched in sweat – the engine room had to be 100 degrees and my shorts looked like they had just fished me out of the ocean. I was totally convinced that the problem had been corrected. With defiance I yelled, “Gentlemen start your engines!” and they did – within minutes the alarm sounded and I turned into bed dejected. I went to bed hoping that we could get close enough to Key West to summon Sea Tow and get hauled in for repairs.\n\nWhen I awoke at 0700 hours I was informed that we were at a 60 degree heading holding five knots and heading directly into Key West – the wind had changed. Bobby Nash told me that he had been sleeping in the cockpit when he was awoken by the sound of a dolphin clearing his blowhole. Billy, at the helm, told him there were two dolphins next to the boat and they could almost be petted from the cockpit. The wind then changed directing us home. It is always believed that dolphins are good luck when accompanying a sailing vessel and this was no exception.\n\nIt was time for me to get back to the engine. I started at the top of the engine, at the heat exchanger – the first bolt I loosened resulted in a flow of sea water. I then removed the hose coming from the raw water pump and instructed the crew to start the engine – not so cocky this time. The pump was functioning and I reassembled everything. The engine ran smoothly and we were able to enter Key West under our own power.\n\nWe arrived at Conch Harbor at 1430 hours. We were welcomed By Carol Cermak who had arrived to join us for our last leg into Marco Island. Conch Harbor is connected with Dante’s a bar with a pool often full of hot young bodies and this day was no exception! Hot showers were the primary concern followed by dinner and an early bed time.\n\nBreakfast was at Blue Heaven with filet eggs benedict and Bloody Mary’s and mimosas! I bought a hat and an extra impellor for the raw water sea pump and three bags of ice and we were off to Marco at 1550 hrs.\n\nWe experienced light southeast winds all night maintaining five- to six-knots with light seas and several cocktails – we deserved a quiet night. We actually slowed down intentionally to ensure that we arrived at daylight making landfall at 0700 hrs.\n\nOne of my crew members wife called us five geriatrics crossing the Florida Straights and wished us luck – I believe we got the luck! I am very glad I made this crossing but doubt if I will do it again. If I do I would insist on two or three days at Key West in both directions – back to back over night crossings take a toll on us geriatrics.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/23"}]}

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}]}

So, health professionals wondered: Could these drugs also be the key to curbing excess drinking?\n\nIn fact, glucagon-like peptide 1 drugs such as semaglutide and liraglutide can be effective at curbing alcohol abuse, a study published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry suggests. Researchers in Sweden examined more than a quarter million people with alcohol-use disorder and found those who had taken GLP-1 drugs cut their risk for hospitalization.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study described it as an important finding and one scientists had been investigating in recent years. However, they warned that Ozempic is not yet ready to replace the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for alcohol abuse.\n\n\"These medications are very promising,\" said Lorenzo Leggio, a clinical investigator and section chief at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). \"But we haven't really reached the point to say, 'Yes, they work.' They may work.\"\n\nLeggio said more research, screening and treatment are needed to address alcohol addiction. Nearly 29 million Americans have alcohol use disorder as of 2023, according to the NIAAA. That represents about 1 in 10 Americans over the age of 12.\n\nBut only 2% of people with alcohol addiction are treated for the disease, Leggio said.\n\n\"The amount of people who die because of alcohol is actually gigantic. It's even bigger than opioids,\" said Leggio, referring to the addiction crisis that began with pain pills and morphed into people taking illicit fentanyl.\n\nThe finding in the study is not the first of its kind.\n\nA 2022 study of 127 people found that GLP-1 drug exenatide reduced drinking among patients with obesity. Other studies showed these weight-loss drugs can curb alcohol use in animals. However, researchers cautioned that more evidence would be needed to conclude these drugs could be used to treat alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nIn the Sweden study, researchers identified more than 133,000 people who had been hospitalized for alcohol addiction between January 2006 and December 2023. About 4,500 patients who took semaglutide, sold under the brands Ozempic and Wegovy, had the lowest risk of hospitalization. Another 2,500 who took liraglutide, marketed as Victoza and Saxenda, had the second lowest risk.\n\nAnd there was another notable finding. The study determined that alcohol-addicted patients who took either version of the weight loss drugs were less likely to be hospitalized than those who took any of three existing medicines approved to treat alcohol-use disorder. The drugs being used to treat alcohol-use disorder are disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study cautioned it does not prove the popular weight-loss drugs work to limit drinking.\n\nSarah Church, a clinical psychologist and executive director of Wholeview Wellness in New York City, said more robust studies are needed\n\n\"It is critical for us to get the results of a randomized controlled trial that compares GLP-1s to the other FDA-approved medications for (alcohol addiction) before we jump to conclusions about the relative effectiveness of the different medications,\" Church said.\n\nLeggio's team at NIAAA and NIDA is enrolling patients in one such study that will randomly assign alcohol-dependent patients to either semaglutide or a placebo.

Or maybe both.\n\n“The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive,” he said.\n\nOn the flip side, the study found that these drugs, known as GLP-1s, are also associated with an increased risk of several negative health outcomes and side effects. The most common were the well-known gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis.\n\nMonica Church, 56, knows about these side effects firsthand. The Goodrich, Michigan resident was hospitalized after taking the medication in December 2023 because she couldn’t keep down any food or fluids.\n\nShe still has stomach pain when she eats certain foods or is under any stress.\n\n“It’s still wreaking havoc on my body,” she said.\n\nResearchers also found the medications were associated with an increased risk of low blood pressure, arthritic disorders, and pancreas and kidney problems.\n\nThe study is the first to map out all the potential benefits and risks associated with this class of medications. Now that health experts have this “atlas” of information, Al-Aly hopes more research is done to better understand how these drugs can impact multiple parts of the body.\n\n“This really should serve as a wake-up call for regulators to demand companies to take a more comprehensive look,” he said.\n\nIn a statement sent to USA TODAY, a spokesperson for drug maker Novo Nordisk said the company welcomes any independent research investigating the safety and efficacy of their products, which include Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.

Many employers don't want to ...", "text": "Kiana Price dropped 35 pounds after she started taking the weight-loss medication Wegovy last year.\n\nThe Greenville, North Carolina, mother no longer gets winded climbing stairs. Her knee pain is gone. And, perhaps most importantly to Price, who is prediabetic, her cholesterol and blood sugar levels have dropped, giving her hope she can escape her family history of diabetes.\n\nBut Price, who works at East Carolina University, worries all her progress may be short-lived. North Carolina's health insurance program for state employees is reeling from the cost and widespread use of these prescription drugs. To cut costs, the state has discontinued coverage for the prescription weight-loss medications Wegovy and Saxenda beginning April 1. Price is now paying more than $1,300 out of pocket per month to continue on Wegovy. It's more than she can afford, which means she's looking at discontinuing the life-changing medication altogether.\n\n\"It's like a slap in the face,\" said Price, who said she'll finish her remaining Wegovy doses by the end of this month. \"I'm just really nervous about all the progress I've made and what's going to happen when I'm not taking it anymore.\"\n\nPatients like Price are struggling to afford a blockbuster class of weight-loss medications called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists. They were initially used to treat diabetes, but drugmakers have since won approval to market these drugs for weight loss and heart disease. More potential uses – and lucrative pharmaceutical company sales – are on the horizon as researchers study new ways to use these drugs. A late-stage study this month reported that the diabetes and weight loss drug tirzepatide also may help treat sleep apnea for people with obesity.\n\nAs the list of medical uses for these drugs grows, more people are asking their doctors for a prescription for meds that can cost more than $10,000 per year. Meanwhile, employers and health insurance plans are attempting to slow runaway spending on these drugs. And insurers have imposed requirements such as prior authorization or step therapy, which mandates that people try less expensive drugs first. In some cases, employers and insurers are denying coverage altogether.\n\nFederal spending on weight-loss drugs surges\n\nMedicare, the federal health program for adults 65 and older, is prohibited by law from covering drugs for the more than 2 in 5 Americans who are obese but otherwise do not have serious risk factors. However, obese patients with diabetes or heart disease may qualify for coverage. The nonprofit health policy organization KFF estimates that 1 in 4 Medicare enrollees who are obese may be eligible for Wegovy to reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nA KFF analysis found Medicare spending on three drugs − Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Rybelsus and Eli Lilly's Mounjaro − surged from $57 million in 2018 to $5.7 billion in 2022. That figure did not include rebates or other discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers. Federal spending on these drugs is likely to grow, experts say. If just 1 in 10 eligible adults take Wegovy to prevent heart attack or stroke, KFF estimated it would cost Medicare's Part D prescription drug coverage nearly $3 billion each year.\n\nThe costs have increased so rapidly, even before Medicare plans are allowed to cover these drugs for weight loss, that the trajectory \"has raised concerns about the fiscal impact of broad coverage of GLP-1 drugs on Medicare, other health insurers, and patients,\" KFF said.\n\nThe high list price combined with the number of projected users among state employees was too much to sustain, North Carolina state officials decided. To continue to afford coverage of the drugs for weight loss, the state would have had to raise premiums to nearly $50 per month for about 750,000 employees and their dependents covered by the state health plan.\n\nMore than 23,000 people on North Carolina's health plan were using these prescription drugs for weight loss. The medication cost the state more than $800 per member per month, on average, after rebates. The state treasurer projected the state's bill for the medication would soar to more than $1 billion over the next six years.\n\nState Treasurer Dale R. Folwell and the state health plan this week formally asked the public for input on how the state can cover the drugs in a fiscally responsible way.\n\n“All we are asking is to be treated fairly and not to be price-gouged by the manufacturers,” Folwell said.\n\nThe state will continue to pay for GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic for diabetes patients. People who take the medication only to lose weight will now have to pay out of pocket.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker that sells the weight-loss drug Wegovy, blasted North Carolina's decision to halt coverage of its weight-loss drugs.\n\nIn a statement, Novo Nordisk said the company was \"surprised and disappointed\" officials overseeing the North Carolina state health plan have rejected \"multiple workable options.\"\n\n\"State health plan officials are abandoning their obligation to employees living with the chronic disease of obesity and denying them coverage for safe and effective treatments,\" the drugmaker said. \"Denying patients insurance coverage for important and effective FDA-approved treatments is simply irresponsible.\"\n\nNorth Carolina workers 'can't afford their premiums to double'\n\nState employees and their families face a difficult situation if they can't shoulder the cost of the drugs, said a union representing state employees.\n\n\"The teachers, the police officers, correctional officers, they can't afford (for) their premiums to double,\" said Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employees Association of North Carolina. Watkins said that's \"essentially\" what would happen if North Carolina continued to cover the medications, she said.\n\nRaleigh resident Tralene Williams exercises daily and runs half marathons. But she credits Wegovy with reducing her cravings, speeding her metabolism and helping her shed more than 30 pounds.\n\n\"It's a miracle drug,\" said Williams, who works for the technological arm of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUnable to afford the more than $1,300 it will cost to refill her Wegovy prescriptions, she worries what will happen when she runs out of medication. She's taking the drug every other week instead of the weekly shot her doctor prescribed.\n\n\"I'm just worried about gaining my weight\" back, Williams said, who added that she does not believe other weight-loss options offered by the state are as effective as the medication she's currently taking.\n\n'Employers don't really have a choice'\n\nEmployers who provide health insurance for working-age Americans and their families also are struggling with the cost of these medications.\n\nA survey by the benefits consultant Mercer cited the sharp increase in the use of GLP-1 drugs showing that it correlated with an 8.4% increase in employer prescription drug spending last year.\n\nWhile employers largely cover GLP-1 drugs for diabetes, companies have been slower to cover these medications for weight loss. Mercer's survey said 41% of employers with large staffs covered these drugs for obesity; an additional 19% of large companies were considering such coverage.\n\nSome employers are beginning to implement programs that require workers to try other weight-loss strategies before qualifying for GLP-1 drugs. Others are imposing strict limits for patients to qualify for these drugs such as minimum body mass index thresholds that would allow coverage only for people who are severely obese.\n\n\"If money wasn't an issue here, then certainly every employer would cover these drugs,\" said James Gelfand, president and CEO of the ERISA Industry Committee, which represents companies that provide employee benefits.\n\n\"There are aspects of these drugs that are miraculous, but at the same time, the price is so egregious and the U.S. is being treated so badly, so much worse than the rest of the world. Employers don't really have a choice. They can't just let it be open season.\"\n\nDrugmakers often launch drugs at higher prices when they have the exclusive right to sell medications before generic companies offer competing versions. Drugmakers say they price drugs to recoup years of research and development costs. They often also must pay lucrative rebates to drug pricing middlemen to get access to customers.\n\nBut the prices for these weight-loss drugs are too high, according to some. A study from Yale University found that weight-loss medications that retail for more than $1,300 a month cost just $22 to make. Sen. Bernie Sanders blasted the Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk this week for charging U.S. residents far more for the diabetes drug Ozempic and the weight-loss drug Wegovy than the company charges for the same medications in other nations.\n\nIn a letter Wednesday to Novo Nordisk's top executive, Sanders questioned why the company charges Americans far more for Wegovy, noting the same drug can be purchased for $140 in Germany and $92 in the United Kingdom.\n\n“The scientists at Novo Nordisk deserve great credit for developing these drugs that have the potential to be a game changer for millions of Americans struggling with type 2 diabetes and obesity,\" Sanders said. \"As important as these drugs are, they will not do any good for the millions of patients who cannot afford them.\"\n\nSanders added that if Novo Nordisk's prices for these drugs are not substantially reduced, \"They have the potential to bankrupt Medicare, Medicaid and our entire health care system.\"\n\n\"The United States Congress and the federal government cannot allow that to happen,” Sanders said.\n\nIn the meantime, prices are extremely high for out-of-pocket purchases. Employers can't wait for price discounts and drugmakers have little incentive to offer price concessions as demand soars. The top-selling injectable drug semaglutide, sold as Wegovy and Ozempic, is also facing a shortage, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFor now, employers and insurers are adopting stricter tools such as prior authorization to ensure patients use the drugs appropriately, said Eileen Pincay, a national pharmacy practice leader at Segal, a benefits consultant.\n\nPincay said employers don't want to pay for weight-loss medication if their employees are seeking it for lifestyle purposes such as quick weight loss. That's why insurance plans require patients to meet strict criteria, and many employers pair this with services such as teaching proper nutrition and exercise.\n\n\"Employers know a lot of members may be using it for off-label use – maybe they want to lose 20 pounds before they go to a wedding,\" said Pincay.\n\nKen Alltucker is on X at @kalltucker, contact him by email at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/04/17/ozempic-withdrawal-surprise-pregnancy/73340586007/", "title": "'Ozempic babies' and what happens when women stop the drug ...", "text": "Women across the country have been bonding online over their “Ozempic babies” − surprise pregnancies while taking weight loss medications, despite being on birth control or having a history of fertility issues. Now, some of them say they’re experiencing intense symptoms such as extreme hunger and rapid weight gain after quitting these drugs cold turkey to protect their baby’s health.\n\nAlthough hunger and weight gain are typical during pregnancy, these women say that the intensity of their symptoms is unlike that of their previous pregnancies. It’s unclear if pregnancy worsens weight loss medication withdrawal, but fertility and bariatric experts say hormonal changes associated with pregnancy could explain the fierce effects.\n\nDrug manufacturers recommend women stop taking weight loss drugs at least two months before a planned pregnancy. When a non-pregnant person quits these medicines, doctors typically help them wean off to mitigate side effects, but women who find out they're expecting must stop immediately.\n\nAs more and more women become pregnant while taking weight loss drugs, experts recommend they talk to their doctors right away, especially if they’re taking drugs like Ozempic to treat diabetes.\n\nWhen Ozempic and pregnancy symptoms collide\n\nAmanda Brierley, 42, started taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) last year to treat her insulin resistance caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Within a month, her menstrual period returned “like clockwork” after several years of dysregulation. Then nine months later, Brierley learned she was pregnant, which was shocking news considering doctors told her she wouldn’t be able to conceive on her own following her last high risk pregnancy over two decades ago.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMedications like Ozempic, Mounjaro, WeGovy and Zepbound appear to boost fertility because the weight loss they induce corrects hormonal imbalances caused by obesity and metabolic disorders; some of them may also reduce the efficacy of birth control pills, increasing chances of pregnancy.\n\nBrierley stopped taking semaglutide right away, per recommendations based on animal studies that found it could cause miscarriage and birth defects if taken while pregnant. A week later, she was possessed with an insatiable hunger: “I was a human garbage can. And I didn’t want sweets or anything. I wanted real food, like meats, cheese and other rich protein, which was completely different from my first pregnancy. I was like a caveman. I couldn’t stop. It was crazy.”\n\nBrierley gained 20 pounds during her first trimester. By the time she gave birth, she had put on 65 pounds. While pregnant with her older son, Brierley gained 19 pounds total.\n\nIn comparison, most women gain anywhere between 25 and 35 pounds throughout their pregnancy, according to the National Institutes of Health. How much weight a person gains depends on their body mass index before they get pregnant, as well as certain health conditions they have that may make it more or less likely to put on weight, said Dr. Allison Rodgers, an OB-GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at Fertility Centers of Illinois.\n\nStopping weight loss medications is known to cause intense hunger pangs, weight gain and blood sugar swings, all of which can be mitigated by slowly weaning off the drugs with a doctor's guidance. However, Rodgers said no studies to date have analyzed how this withdrawal interferes with pregnancy symptoms, and vice versa.\n\n“Do weight loss medications suppress some pregnancy symptoms that then return more intensely when a person gets off of them? Or does pregnancy worsen withdrawal symptoms?” Rodgers said. “It’s really hard to tease out.”\n\nDr. Sahar Takkouche, a bariatrician and associate professor of medicine with the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that quitting weight loss drugs disrupts the systems in your body responsible for blood glucose and appetite control. So it’s possible that quitting these drugs cold turkey, as opposed to weaning off of them, plus pregnancy, may be intensifying the symptoms that both experiences share.\n\n“Pregnant women, in particular, may experience these symptoms more intensely due to hormonal changes that occur with pregnancy and blood sugar swings,” Takkouche said. \"Ideally, I recommend a gradual taper off of these medications, when clinically feasible.\"\n\nDeb Oliviara, 32, said she also experienced extreme hunger and weight gain after stopping Ozempic when she learned of her “surprise” pregnancy.\n\n“In a way, it was very clear that it wasn't just from the pregnancy because I've been pregnant six times, so this is not new to me,” Oliviara said. “I understand how that normally feels, but it was an insatiable hunger that I have never felt in my life.”\n\nShe gained 20 pounds in just two months despite continuing a healthy diet and lifestyle. Oliviara said the rapid weight gain affected her mentally because of how physically uncomfortable she became. Her symptoms calmed down after about three months.\n\nExtreme weight gain during pregnancy can be dangerous\n\nIn some scenarios, rapid weight gain during pregnancy could introduce health risks to mother and baby, Rodgers said: “You don't want to not listen to your body, but you don’t want to overconsume either.”\n\nDeveloping gestational diabetes, for example, can increase risks of high blood pressure and having a large baby that needs to be delivered by cesarean section, which involves more complications like blood clots and infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Gestational diabetes also puts babies at higher risk of low blood sugar, developing Type 2 diabetes later in life and preterm labor.\n\nIt’s especially important for women who are taking drugs like Ozempic to treat their existing diabetes to ensure they keep their condition under control after quitting the drug when they learn they’re pregnant, Rodgers said. If blood sugar levels are too high, particularly during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, babies face increased risks of birth defects, such as spinal cord, heart and limb abnormalities.\n\n“Regardless of whether you just stopped Ozempic, it's important to take care of yourself while pregnant — make sure you get proper nutrition and don't have too little or too much weight gain,” Rodgers said. “And if you are diabetic, follow up with your doctor to switch to a safer medication like metformin or insulin as soon as you find out you’re pregnant.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/06/04/weight-loss-fda-approves-wegovy-highly-effective-drug-treatment-obesity/5288322001/", "title": "Weight loss: FDA approves highly effective drug treatment for obesity", "text": "Lisa Robillard has struggled with her weight since she was 10 years old.\n\nOver the years, she has tried at least 15 fad diets advertised on magazine covers.

And, in the midst of a national shortage of key ingredients in the drugs, many have turned to compounded versions of it, sometimes obtaining prescriptions online in a matter of hours.\n\nThe distribution of compounded weight-loss medication − particularly through telehealth and online platforms − remains controversial, and it's a growing gray area as the world embraces weight-loss medication. For some, especially the uninsured or those who can't afford traditional brands like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, these cheaper, non-FDA-approved versions are a lifeline.\n\nFor others, however, the accessibility has led to misuse.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a wild west in who's writing for this medication now, because it is so revolutionary,\" Dr. Alexandra Sowa, an obesity medicine specialist and founder of SoWell, says. \"Not all compounding pharmacies are created equal. I love compounding pharmacies. I'll tell you, I think that they are great.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMicrodosing Ozempic:Ozempic is so popular people are trying to 'microdose' it. Is that a bad idea?\n\nFor those who can't afford Ozempic, compounded drugs are a lifeline\n\nJasmine Martin has long struggled with weight. Shortly after her father died from Type 2 diabetes complications in June 2022, Martin learned about compounded weight-loss drugs from a friend. She called a telehealth company that day and got an appointment.\n\nAfter a Zoom call with a licensed physician in her state, in which she shared her medical history, Martin received a prescription for a compounded drug containing tirzepatide − the active ingredient also found in Mounjaro and Zepbound. Martin has lost about 80 pounds since and continues to take the medication. She also now works with the telehealth service Mochi Health, which pays her to post social media content about the company.\n\n\"This medicine has been life changing for so many of us,\" Martin says. \"I went from being morbidly obese to being in a healthy body weight. I was taking blood-pressure medication, and now I don't. I went from 222 pounds to 140 pounds.\"\n\nMore:Oprah Winfrey's revelation about using weight loss drugs is a game changer. Here's why.\n\nThe explosion of interest in weight-loss medication over the past few years has rocked the medical and pharmaceutical landscape. People everywhere are clamoring for these drugs, and, sometimes, not just to lose weight. A mid-stage study unveiled in July, for instance, found that weight-loss medication may slow cognitive decline. Researchers have also found it may help with nicotine cravings and heart disease too.\n\nAll this has led to a drug shortage − and an opportunity for compounding pharmacies to step in.\n\nWhen there is a shortage of FDA-approved, brand-name medication – like with GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy – the FDA says it allows compounding pharmacies to make alternative medications that are \"essentially a copy\" of the brand-name drug with the same active ingredient − usually semaglutide or tirzepatide, which suppress appetite. These compounding pharmacies are generally regulated by state boards of pharmacy and source ingredients from FDA-registered facilities, but the agency does not verify their drugs’ safety, effectiveness or quality.\n\nAre they safe?Weight loss drugs sold online offer cheaper alternative to Ozempic, Wegovy\n\nFor many, however, compounded medication is their only option.\n\nMartin says it's been a saving grace, especially during periods when she didn't have health insurance. If she had to take a name-brand drug instead, she says she'd need to pay $1,000-$1,200 a month. The compounded drug she takes only costs around a couple hundred, without insurance.\n\nThough the FDA removed tirzepatide from its shortage list earlier this month, Martin remains optimistic compounded weight-loss medication will remain available as doctors continue prescribing it.\n\n\"Everybody's afraid that compounded medications are going to go away, but compounded medications have been around for a long time,\" she says. \"It's just going to transition.\"\n\nOzempic is everywhere online. Doctors say it's the 'wild west'\n\nThe ease and accessibility of compounded medication, particularly through telehealth, has been a double-edged sword, with some online providers more thoroughly evaluating patients than others. Some require phone or video consultations with a provider, but, for others, getting a GLP-1 prescription online doesn’t always require proof of body mass index or lab tests.\n\nScott Brunner, the CEO of the Alliance of Pharmacy Compounding, says the issue isn't with compounded medication, but rather with companies that distribute it irresponsibly. \"I am reading in media and hearing tales of certain telehealth platforms that may not be spending the requisite time with the patient,\" he says. \"There may well not be a valid patient-prescriber relationship, and I believe that's a travesty.\"\n\nWhat is 'Ozempic face'?How we refer to weight-loss side effects matters.\n\nDoctors agree problems mainly arise due to prescribers being irresponsible rather than the drugs themselves. Dr. Britta Reierson, a board-certified family physician and obesity medicine specialist at the healthcare company Knownwell, says she's seen more people circumventing traditional channels to get weight-loss medication, which can lead to serious problems.\n\n\"Even in my social circle, I have friends who (say they) got 'the fat drug' off of a website, and I just rail inside,\" she says. \"I'm just seething inside just knowing that A, I know they're not taking it for the right reasons, and B, this might not be safe for them.\"\n\nIn some cases, she says, online providers don't give adequate instructions for people on how to self-administer the drugs either. Earlier this year, the FDA issued a warning about dosing errors leading to \"adverse events, some requiring hospitalization.\"\n\n\"They're looking online to YouTube and saying, 'How do I dose this?' \" Reierson says. \"It's not under the guidance of a medical professional, which can really result in a lot of side effects.\"\n\nWho gets Ozempic?People with private insurance and generous health plans, study shows\n\nThough Martin says her telehealth experience has been positive, she understands it's a controversial route to go down. She encourages people interested in it to do thorough research and always make sure they consult a doctor.\n\n\"A lot of people will just prescribe the medications, and you never speak to a doctor. They don't tell you how to take it. They don't tell you what to expect,\" she says. \"You should have medical guidance from a physician, not just from your favorite content creator.\"\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/01/02/jillian-michaels-ozempic-weight-loss-menopause/71963133007/", "title": "Jillian Michaels on Ozempic, weight loss and menopause", "text": "Weight less drugs like Ozempic popped up everywhere in 2023.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWeight loss medications work by sending signals to the appetite center of the brain to reduce hunger and increase fullness, according to Dr. Deborah Horn, an assistant professor of surgery at the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. Once a person stops taking the drug, that effect is gone, paving the way for some people to regain what they lost if they don't adjust their diet and exercise patterns.\n\nIt's not clear whether the newer generation of weight loss drugs, which suppress appetite, will provide different long-term results than other weight loss approaches.\n\nIn the longest study, lasting 68 weeks – about 16 months – weight loss plateaued and started to climb again by the end, suggesting people's bodies had acclimated to the drugs. Side effects from Ozempic run the gamut – from losing too much weight, to gaining it all back, to plateauing. Not to mention the nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues.\n\nBefore taking a weight loss drug, Michaels suggests looking into supplements like berberine and yerba mate tea as alternatives. She also recommends checking in with a doctor before supplementing one's diet. \"I have no problem with people taking these formulas,\" she says. \"But somebody just needs to make sure that they're doing your bloodwork regularly, and that your hormones are actually balanced in an optimal way.\"\n\nStill, Michaels holds \"zero judgment\" for those who use these drugs as part of their weight loss arsenal. She \"just would like people to try every other way forward first.\"\n\n'There's no secret' to weight loss\n\nSome of those ways forward: eating less (what weight loss drugs can help with), avoiding added sugars and moving more. Of course, it's easier said than done, and will not yield the same results for everyone.\n\n\"We don't want people eating so little that they're not getting enough nutrients,\" Michaels says. \"But what these drugs have shown is that it doesn't matter your age, menopause, no menopause, this that the other, if you are eating a bit less food, and moving a bit more often, you can absolutely manage your weight.\"\n\nMoving more \"doesn't mean go crazy at 50 in a way you never have,\" she adds. \"It means obviously work to your current fitness level. But there are no types of fitness that are out of bounds as you age – quite the opposite.\" Think high intensity interval training and strength training. Intermittent fasting can also help with weight loss.\n\nLosing weight grows harder as one ages. A 30-year-old might burn 2,000 calories a day, for example, compared to a 50-year-old burning 1,300 calories. If that's the case, you need to exercise more and avoid eating everything you did in your 30s. Her 13-year-old can eat her entire refrigerator, she jokes, but she can only eat the rail on the right door.\n\n\"That is the science of it,\" she says. \"There's no secret to it.\" This diligence will come in handy once women hit menopause and undergo hormone changes: \"There is no like, 'Oh, I hit menopause and now it's a slow descent into decrepitude,'\" Michaels says \"It's just not true. Jane Fonda looked amazing – she still does!\"\n\nShe knows that curbing one's diet of added sugars isn't ideal. But in her opinion, it might be the alternative: \"Does it suck? Yes, but it's a lot better than taking a drug that's going to have crazy side effects that you can never get off of, and you'll eventually plateau on.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub and Katie Camero", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/12/04/weight-loss-treatment-medication-availability/10794568002/", "title": "Wegovy, Mounjaro and new weight loss medication availability in ...", "text": "The science that helped develop weight loss drug Wegovy is leading to other medications that are expected in 2023.\n\nThese new drugs can reduce weight up to 20%, though doctors caution that not everyone will benefit.\n\nAnalysts estimate the weight loss medication field could generate $50 billion annually by 2030.\n\nA new generation of anti-obesity medications offers the promise of dramatic weight loss but there is still a long way to go to make them accessible to those who need them.\n\nObesity is the last major untapped medical condition – one that more than 100 million Americans share – and drug companies have been trying for decades to develop a treatment.\n\nFinally, medications are coming on the market with the promise of reducing weight by 15% to more than 20%, more than has ever been possible with medications and the kind of weight loss rarely seen outside of surgery.\n\nBut so far, only the wealthiest and luckiest have been able to access the first of a new class of medications.

Andy Beshear met with leaders from 25 international corporations to discuss potential expansion into the United States.\n\nBeshear views his trip as a success, highlighting the opportunity to promote Kentucky on a global stage and build relationships with key decision-makers.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear is back in Kentucky after speaking last week at the World Economic Forum, an annual global meeting held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, that brings together some of the world's most powerful political and business leaders.\n\n\"I believe that Kentucky was invited because we have broken every economic development record in our books, from private sector investment to new jobs to exports to tourism,\" Beshear told the Courier Journal on Monday. \"I mean, our economy is on a roll.\"\n\nThe trip provided Beshear an opportunity to rub elbows with companies that have an existing presence in Kentucky, all of which he said experienced \"the best years in their history,\" bringing some of the highest corporate profits the state has ever seen. And with a quick pit stop in Madrid, Spain, enroute to Davos, Beshear got to meet with North American Stainless, a key company on the supply chain for GE Appliances.\n\nAdditionally, the governor spent time recruiting new businesses to the Bluegrass State, having met with 25 international corporations looking to make a move to the United States.\n\n\"Being able to introduce our 'New Kentucky Home' to the world on one of the preeminent world stages, was an opportunity that we absolutely had to take, and from the comments that we received, I think we'll see a lot of return,\" Beshear said teasing soon-to-come economic development projects.\n\nThe Courier Journal sat down with Beshear to discuss the trip. A recap of the conversation is provided below.\n\nThis interview has been edited for context and clarity.\n\nWhat would you say is your most important takeaway from the World Economic Forum?\n\nBeshear: \"I think the biggest takeaway is we're on the right track. The things that we are delivering on in Kentucky, be it how we prioritize reliability, affordability and then sustainability in our energy portfolio, was exactly how these companies look at it. They want to see all three, but each one is so important. Kentucky's investment, what we're seeing out of Ford and SK [On], out of AESC, out of Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing, my biggest takeaway is we're not just booming as a state economy, but we are on the right track with the industries of the future and that other countries see it.\"\n\nWhy was your attendance at WEF beneficial to the average Kentuckian?\n\nBeshear: \"Well, for anybody who thinks I was on a vacation, I was sitting in a conference room about eight and a half hours a day doing a version of corporate speed dating to ensure that we met and got significant value out of this. Think about it, 25 meetings and five panels with some of the most influential CEOs in the entire world with the opportunity to talk about Kentucky, the chance to meet with one CEO whose company may be based in Asia, another in Europe, the chance to be able to sell Kentucky and to have Kentucky on that stage when just about no other state was there this year, I mean, it was an extraordinary opportunity. And while some of those CEOs might have come in not knowing about Kentucky, let me tell you, every participant in the World Economic Forum left knowing where we are, what we do, and who to call when they're interested in setting up their American expansion.\"\n\nWhat are you most excited to have been able to bring back with you to Kentucky?\n\nBeshear: \"I'm most excited for some of the direct relationships with the leaders of these companies that can, will or already do, invest in Kentucky. For a one-week total trip, we had more meetings with higher-level officials, with the final decision-making authority to bring new jobs or expand the number of jobs in Kentucky. The efficiency — being able to do these meetings back-to-back-to-back — one could result in 100 jobs and one could result in 1,000; that's the type of opportunity that you have there. It was very clear while we were there that the growth in the United States is some of the largest in the world, and that these companies are looking to invest more in the United States. So, as I left, one of the takeaways I had is that we're going to see a lot more foreign direct investment.\"\n\nWhy was it important for you to accept this invitation and speak on behalf of Kentucky to the World Economic Forum?\n\nBeshear: \"I was able to meet with 10 existing Kentucky companies whose headquarters are on three different continents in one place together — they employ about 8,500 Kentuckians — and the chance to do this in one trip is something that you rarely get. It gave us a chance to thank them for their Kentucky investments, talk about any challenges they face, and then make our pitch for expansions of the Kentucky facilities. But it's also important to market our state, to be there in front of different companies that have maybe never looked at Kentucky in a place like Davos.\"\n\nWere there any companies or CEOs that you met with that have you really excited for what could be done in Kentucky in the future?\n\nBeshear: \"We met with a number of CEOs that I believe are going to give Kentucky a very strong look. We went through the different potential participants, and we looked at who had announced that they were going to do U.S. expansions but hadn't yet decided where. We also looked at what companies are moving into, or a big part of some of the new area industries that we have, or some of the clusters. We met with companies that are suppliers to EV battery manufacturers. We met with companies that are in the metals industry. We met with companies that, again, were looking for a home in the United States where they could reach most of the U.S. population. It was an exciting week, and the conversations were directly with the international CEOs in almost all of these instances, and that's a meeting that's not easy to get.\"\n\nThis story was updated to add Story Highlights and additional images.\n\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, formerly known as Twitter, at @oliviamevans_.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/business/elon-musk-vs-joe-biden/index.html", "title": "Why Elon Musk and Joe Biden both love EVs but can't stand each ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden loves electric vehicles.\n\nHe wants half of all new US cars sold by 2030 to be EVs. He proposed a series of incentives to help make that happen – including tax credits for buyers and government support for charging stations.\n\nBut he’s showed little love for Tesla, an American company and by far the largest EV maker in the world.\n\nAnd Tesla CEO Elon Musk hasn’t been shy about taking shots at Biden.\n\nThere is a legitimate question as to why Biden has been mostly silent about Tesla when promoting the benefits of electric vehicles. And that can likely be summed up in three letters: UAW.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union has broad concerns about what the industry-wide shift to EVs will mean for members’ jobs, because electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts and require less labor to assemble. Ford estimates it takes about 30% less labor to make an EV than make a traditional car.\n\nMuch of the value of EVs comes from the battery packs. So far, the unionized automakers have set up joint ventures to build battery plants, rather than build them at their own factories. It’s not clear if those battery factories will wind up being unionized.\n\nBut the UAW has so far voiced support for the EV efforts of their pro-union ally Biden. UAW President Ray Curry attended an EV summit at the White House along with the CEOs of General Motors, Ford (F) and Stellantis in August — a meeting to which Musk was not invited.\n\nKeeping his allies in the UAW supportive of the switch to EVs would be much more difficult if Biden was seen as a cheerleader for a nonunion automaker like Tesla.\n\nWhen asked if the lack of union representation was the reason Tesla was missing even though the CEOs of automakers with a fraction of Tesla’s EV sales were included, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki didn’t dispute that interpretation.\n\n“Well, these are the three largest employers of the United Auto Workers, so I’ll let you draw your own conclusion,” she said.\n\nThe UAW declined to comment for this story.\n\nMusk vs the UAW\n\nTesla remains staunchly nonunion, and Musk is as opposed to organized labor as any CEO in the industry. The National Labor Relations Board has ruled against him on several occasions. The UAW has made little progress in its efforts to organize at Tesla, and Musk has repeatedly taunted the union and its supporters.\n\n“New UAW slogan: ‘Fighting for their right to steal money from workers!’” he tweeted in November.\n\nIn October, he said the relationship between the UAW and Biden is the main reason Tesla has not received any support from the otherwise pro-EV administration.\n\n“Biden is a UAW sock puppet,” Musk tweeted.\n\nMusk vs. Biden’s EV plans\n\nThe Build Back Better legislation, which is on life support in Congress, has all types of goodies to encourage consumers to buy EVs. That includes an enhanced tax credit for EV buyers, and would give an extra large credit for those who buy EVs built in the United States by unionized labor — as well as government support for a network of charging stations.\n\nBut Tesla would benefit less from those perks than the other EV makers, and Musk has said he doesn’t support those programs.\n\nWhen Biden had the CEOs of GM and Ford back to the White House last month to confer about EVs and Build Back Better, Musk was again not invited, a snub that sparked more Twitter attacks.\n\nSo did a tweet from Biden’s official account that showed the president with GM CEO Mary Barra and quoted him saying, “I meant it when I said the future was going to be made right here in America. Companies like GM and Ford are building more electric vehicles here at home than ever before.”\n\nBiden made the statement even though Ford and GM build only a fraction of the EVs Tesla produces in California.\n\nA White House official said it was Musk’s lack of support for the EV provisions in the Build Back Better legislation — not Tesla’s non-union status — that kept Musk from appearing at the meeting.\n\n“The recent event at the White House was for business leaders that support BBB to talk about how it is good for the economy,” the official said.\n\nAsked about Biden conspicuously not mentioning Tesla when talking about EVs, the official said, “Tesla has done extraordinary things for electric vehicles and that’s a big part of why the whole industry now knows EVs are the future. Tesla also benefited greatly from past EV tax credits, but unfortunately, their CEO has suggested an opposition to new EV tax credits.”\n\nBut the White House did not shy away from the union issue.\n\n“We are going to continue fighting for legislation to expand access and create high-quality jobs building EVs,” the official said. “President Biden is focused on creating good union jobs across the country and believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to bargain collectively with their employer.”\n\nOther reasons Musk doesn’t like Biden\n\nBut it’s not just a difference over EV incentives that has Musk mad at the Biden administration. He’s also made clear that he opposes Biden administration proposals to raise taxes on America’s wealthiest Americans as well as establishing a minimum tax on profitable US companies, such as Tesla, which faces little in the way of federal income tax due to past losses.\n\nMusk apparently will end up with a record $11 billion tax bill for 2021 due to exercising tens of billions worth of stock options that had been set to expire. But in other years the world’s richest person is able to avoid paying any taxes because his reportable income is close to zero even if his holdings are worth hundreds of billions.\n\nAnd he’s made it clear that he opposes Democratic proposals that would change, though he’s directed most of his fire on the issue at Democratic senators such as Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, who have proposed taxing the richest American’s wealth, not just their income.\n\nMusk also made clear that he questions government mandates meant to combat Covid-19 measures, calling the stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic “fascist” and at times questioning the health risk posed by Covid.\n\nWhile Biden has clearly said he wishes to avoid a return to stay at home orders, he has advocated government rules and action meant to combat the pandemic.\n\n– CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/economy/degrowth-climate-cop27/index.html", "title": "Degrowth: A dangerous idea or the answer to the world's biggest ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nConventional economic logic hinges on a core assumption: Bigger economies are better, and finding ways to maintain or boost growth is paramount to improving society.\n\nBut what if growth is at best doing little to fix the world’s problems, and at worst fostering the destruction of the planet and jeopardizing its future?\n\nThat’s the radical message from the “degrowth” movement, which has spent decades on the political fringes with its warning that limitless growth needs to end. Now, after the pandemic gave people in some parts of the world a chance to rethink what makes them happy, and as the scale of change necessary to address the climate crisis becomes clearer, its ideas are gaining more mainstream recognition — even as anxiety builds over what could be a painful global recession.\n\nFor economists and politicians of all stripes, growth has long served as a North Star. It’s a vehicle for creating jobs and generating taxes for public services, increasing prosperity in rich countries and reducing poverty and hunger in poorer ones.\n\nLondon's financial district can be seen in the distance beyond housing developments on October 8, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nBut degrowthers argue that an endless desire for more — bigger national economies, greater consumption, heftier corporate profits — is myopic, misguided and ultimately harmful. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a poor metric for social wellbeing, they stress.\n\nPlus, they see expanding a global economy that’s already doubled in size since 2005 — and, at 2% growth annually, would be more than seven times bigger in a century — putting the emissions goals necessary to save the world out of reach.\n\n“An innocent 2 or 3% per year, it’s an enormous amount of growth — cumulative growth, compound growth — over time,” said Giorgos Kallis, a top degrowth scholar based at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. “I don’t see it being compatible with the physical reality of the planet.”\n\nThe solution, according to the degrowth movement, is to limit the production of unnecessary goods, and to try to reduce demand for items that aren’t needed.\n\nThis unorthodox school of thought has no shortage of critics. Bill Gates has called degrowthers unrealistic, emphasizing that asking people to consume less for the sake of the climate is a losing battle. And even believers acknowledge their framework can be a political nonstarter, given how difficult it is to imagine what weaning off growth would look like in practice.\n\n“The fact that it’s an uncomfortable concept, it’s both a strength and a weakness,” said Gabriela Cabaña, a degrowth advocate from Chile and doctoral candidate at the London School of Economics.\n\nYet in some corners, it’s becoming less taboo, especially as governments and industry fall behind in their efforts to stop the planet from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, after which some effects of climate change will become irreversible.\n\nClimate activists, including degrowth supporters, gathered in Munich on November 12, 2021. Action Press/Shutterstock\n\nThe UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently cited degrowth in a major report. The European Research Council just allocated roughly $10 million to Kallis and two peers to explore practical “post-growth” policies. And the European Parliament is planning a conference called “Beyond Growth” next spring. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to attend.\n\nEven some on Wall Street are beginning to pay closer attention. Investment bank Jefferies said investors should consider what happens if degrowth gathers steam, noting “climate-anxious” younger generations have different consumer values.\n\nDiagnosing a problem\n\nIn the debate over how to avoid climate catastrophe, there’s a key point of consensus: If the worst effects of global warming are to be averted, the world needs to slash annual carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. After that, they need to decline steeply, and fast.\n\nMost roadmaps laying out a plan to achieve this involve a dramatic reconfiguration of economies around clean energy and other emissions-reducing solutions, while promoting new technologies and market innovations that make them more affordable. This would allow the global economy to keep growing, but in a way that’s “green.”\n\nYet proponents of degrowth are skeptical that the world can reduce emissions in time — and protect delicate, interconnected ecological systems — while pursuing infinite economic expansion, which they argue will inevitably require the use of more energy.\n\nA construction site in Belgrade, Serbia in heavy smog on Nov. 1, 2022. Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“More growth means more energy use, and more energy use makes it more difficult to decarbonize the energy system in the short time we have left,” said Jason Hickel, a degrowth expert who is part of the team that received funding from the European Research Council. “It’s like trying to run down an escalator that is accelerating upward against you.”\n\nEven if energy can become green, growth also requires natural resources like water, minerals and timber.\n\nIt’s a concern that’s been echoed by Greta Thunberg, arguably the most famous climate activist. She’s criticized “fairy tales about non-existent technological solutions” and “eternal economic growth.” And she’s touched on another point degrowthers raise: Is our current system, which has produced rampant inequality, even working for us?\n\nThis question resonates in the Global South, where there are fears the green energy revolution could simply replicate existing patterns of exploitation and excessive resource extraction, but with metals and minerals like nickel or cobalt — key components of batteries — instead of oil.\n\nThe “love for growth,” said Felipe Milanez, a professor and degrowth advocate based in the Brazilian state of Bahia, is “extremely violent and racist, and it’s just been reproducing local forms of colonialism.”\n\nThe end of growth?\n\nDegrowth can be hard to talk about, especially as fears grow about a global recession, with all the pain of lost jobs and shattered businesses that implies.\n\nBut advocates, which often speak about recessions as symptoms of a broken system, make clear they aren’t promoting austerity, or telling developing countries that are eager to raise living standards they shouldn’t reap the benefits of economic development.\n\nInstead, they talk about sharing more goods, reducing food waste, moving away from privatized transportation or health care and making products last longer, so they don’t need to be purchased at such regular intervals. It’s about “thinking in terms of sufficiency,” Cabaña put it.\n\nCars make their way in New Jersey on April 22, 2022. The United States is the second-largest contributor of CO2 emissions. Kena Betancur/VIEWpress/Getty Images\n\nAdopting degrowth would require a dramatic rethink of the market capitalism that has been embraced by just about every society on the planet in recent decades.\n\nYet some proposals could exist within the current system. A universal basic income — in which everyone receives a lump sum payment regardless of employment status, allowing the economy to reduce its reliance on polluting industries — is often mentioned. So is a four-day work week.\n\n“When people have more economic security and have more economic freedoms, they make better decisions,” Cabaña said.\n\nHigh-profile critics\n\nThe latest report from the IPCC — the UN authority on global warming — noted that “addressing inequality and many forms of status consumption and focusing on wellbeing supports climate change mitigation efforts,” a nod to one of degrowth’s biggest objectives. The movement was name-checked, too.\n\nBut degrowth is also the subject of significant opposition, even from climate scholars and activists with similar goals.\n\n“The degrowth people are living a fantasy where they assume that if you bake a smaller cake, then for some reason, the poorest will get a bigger share of it,” said Per Espen Stoknes, director of the Center for Green Growth at the BI Norwegian Business School. “That has never happened in history.”\n\nSteam and smoke rises from the coal-powered Belchatow Power Station in Rogowiec, Poland. The station emits approximately 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Omar Marques/Getty Images\n\nBackers of green growth are convinced their strategy can work. They cite promising examples of decoupling GDP gains from emissions, from the United Kingdom to Romania, and to the rapid rise in the affordability of renewable energy.\n\nGates, the Microsoft co-founder who’s prioritized investing in climate innovations, admits that overhauling global energy systems is a Herculean task. But he thinks boosting the accessibility of the right technologies can still get us there.\n\nDegrowthers know their critiques are controversial, though in some ways, that’s the intent. They think a starker, more revolutionary approach is necessary given the UN estimate that global warming is due to rise to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius, based on the world’s current climate pledges.\n\n“The less time [that] is left now, the more radical change is needed,” said Kohei Saito, a professor at the University of Tokyo.\n\nCould a growing cohort agree?

Paul and James McElwain are a DJ duo unofficially embraced by the right and seeking to infuse more fun to politics.\n\nThe two have been involved in DJ event production for around a decade under the name “Milk N Cooks.” Paul said they entered the politics afterparty production scene after noticing a “gaping hole” in fun parties and entertainment surrounding the often intense and contentious political realm.\n\nServers wore tank tops with “No tax on tips” printed across their chests, a Republican Party talking point earlier in the day. About 100 people crowded around the bar around 10 p.m.\n\nPaul said he hopes the event brings people together.\n\n\"We lean a certain way, but we're not explicit about that and it's just, hey, we're trying to put on a good event for people to want to hang out, have good time and socialize,” Paul said.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nMichigan Rep.

Employees at several restaurants said a variety of factors beyond the RNC — the early weekday, humidity and rain — could have played a role in reducing foot traffic.\n\nAt Cafe Benelux, an employee said the number of diners was “significantly” lower than a normal Monday night.\n\nAt the Milwaukee Public Market, stools at the Tiki Bar were mostly filled. An employee said traffic was about what he’d expect.\n\nCity Social employee Jeloni Woulard also said business was normal for a Monday.

King Dr. had four patrons inside, and down the street at Who’s On Third, the Old German Beer Hall and Brat House each had about a dozen people eating and drinking.\n\nAt Milwaukee's famous German restaurant, Mader's, the large outdoor beer garden was empty, and a third of the tables inside occupied.\n\nPere Marquette Park, a fenced-off area which is an extension of the Republican National Convention, had a handful of people sitting on benches as the sun set and the storm began to roll over Milwaukee.\n\n— Jordyn Noennig and Vanessa Swales\n\nFormer president Trump is en route to the Republican National Convention, CNN, ABC are reporting\n\nDonald Trump is expected to make an appearance, but is not expected to speak, according to ABC News.\n\n“A large motorcade recently left the hotel where Trump is staying and appears to be heading in the direction of the venue,” ABC News said.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly gets business as official watch party\n\nDrink Wisconsinbly in the Deer District was getting good business, thanks to its location near Fiserv Forum and the home of the watch party, according to Nick Olgray, manager at Drink Wisconsinbly.\n\n“This is busier than what we were expecting,” he said.\n\nHe suspected that the shooting of Trump Saturday “brought out a lot of people.”\n\nOlgray said that, when the convention took a break in the afternoon, the space was full, with a line out the door.\n\nAround 7:30, there was a lull, with about 30 people in the bar and a Fox News setup for a live broadcast. Olgray said the bar benefited from hosting both private parties and then opening to the public for watch parties.\n\n“It’s the best of both worlds,” he said.\n\nMarc Wontorek of New York was at Drink Wisconsinbly watching Sen.

Ron Johnson says teleprompter loaded wrong speech\n\nAfter the speech, an aide to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the speech Johnson read was not the final version he intended to deliver.\n\nHis final speech began with Johnson saying \"we should all heed President Trump's call for unity, strength and determination,\" the aide said. And he read a line that he did not want in the final version: \"Today's Democrat agenda, their policies, are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people.\"\n\nAsked who was responsible for the error, Johnson's staff replied: \"Not us.\"\n\nRead full story\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nSen.

Derrick Van Orden praises Vance as 'exquisite' pick\n\nU.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin told the Journal Sentinel that Vance was an \"exquisite\" running-mate pick for Trump's campaign.\n\nVan Orden spoke of his shared experiences with Vance as a person who grew up in rural poverty to a single mother, joined the military, and pursued a position in Congress.\n\nHe believes Vance will attract voters in the 3rd Congressional District because they share a similar experience. Van Orden said Vance's upbringing and commitment to serving voters who live in rural areas or below the poverty line will offer a balance to the Republican ticket, contrasting Trump's billionaire status.\n\n\"If you look at that, that's an expression of the American dream,\" he said. \"People are going to gravitate towards that.\"\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nLocal government leaders decry Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal government leaders from across the U.S. gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to highlight the importance of the level of government closest to the people.\n\n“America’s mayors are driving solutions at the local level,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who was joined by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Rancho Cordova, California, Mayor David Sander and New York City Council member Joseph Borelli.\n\nThe group said whether Trump or President Joe Biden wins a second White House term, local governments will need a strong partnership with the federal government to address challenges in communities.\n\nJohnson pointed to the federal pandemic aid that reached local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act, saying it helped prevent Milwaukee from becoming insolvent and gave Wisconsin’s largest city the time it needed to reach a funding agreement with the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nSander, who is also president of the National League of Cities, called the attempted assassination an “attempt to murder democracy.”\n\n“That violence is a reminder of the responsibilities we all have as leaders to create stronger communities and to act swiftly to disavow hate and violence wherever we find it,” he said. “It was a reminder quite frankly of what our fellow mayors and council members and aldermen have known for way too long: that hate and violence toward elected officials in our country has been rising and it must end.”\n\nLeaders, he said, must “model better ideals for our democracy.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nFire and medical personnel field heat exhaustion calls\n\nA man experiencing what a police officer said was heat exhaustion got help from Milwaukee police and medics around 5:40 p.m. near the corner of State and Water streets as vehicles entered the convention perimeter.\n\nTemperatures in Milwaukee reached the upper 80s Monday.

She later took to X again to call Trump “the strength the world needs.”\n\nTruss was a member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in various capacities from 2010 to 2024. Earlier this month, she lost her seat in Parliament in the U.K. general election.\n\nIn 2022, Truss resigned around a month and a half after becoming UK prime minister, making her the shortest-serving UK PM, BBC reported.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Cory Booker meet with high school students\n\nU.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke with a group of high school students at the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Monday afternoon, listening to stories of why investing in the arts should be more important for the federal government.\n\nThe two also weighed in on Trump’s vice presidential selection in the hours after the announcement.\n\nBaldwin said that Trump’s selection of Vance was an “expected choice in many ways.” She said she’s worked to author legislation with Vance, but said that Democrats now have to keep the focus on their values.\n\n“What we have to keep the focus on is the difference between what Democrats stand for and our ticket,” she said. “And what (Republicans) stand for, Project 2025 is extremely scary. And voters need to know that they have a real choice.”\n\nBooker echoed that sentiment.\n\n“They don’t stand with the values of the majority of American people when it comes to things like health coverage, with reproductive rights,” he said. “So this is going to be a very clear choice.”\n\nThe senators also addressed the growing amount of political violence in America, which culminated in former president being shot Saturday.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nInterview with Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\nChurch flies LGBTQ+ Pride flag as message of love\n\nJust a couple of blocks east of Fiserv Forum at Village Church, Pastor Donna Brown and congregants hung up an LGBTQ+ Pride flag outside the front of the unassuming building.\n\n“We’re called to be inclusive and loving,” Brown said. “Anybody is welcome in, even if they don’t agree with us.”\n\nShe and four members of the church were laying out food and drinks inside the building, preparing for the rescheduled gathering. It’s a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America denomination with a special designation to welcome LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nEarlier, she had placed a sign in large font on the front door reading “No Weapons Allowed.\"\n\n“We don’t feel violence is an answer,” Brown said. “More weapons cause more violence.”\n\nLifelong Milwaukeean and member of the church Bill Koehn, 73, said security and the events of the last 48 hours were the main topics of conversation at the church’s Sunday service.\n\n“The bottom line is we are all about spreading the message of love and we don’t discriminate,” Koehn said.\n\nGesturing to the flag, he said: “If somebody has an issue with this being displayed or the fact that there is a church right here, on whatever level, that’s why we have our doors open so we can sit down and have a dialogue like this and get the opinions from people.”\n\nWhile he lamented Milwaukee's failed DNC in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Koehn said he was “OK” with the convention being in Milwaukee, especially the economic benefits and how it highlights the city of Milwaukee “in a way that doesn’t happen very often.”\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nMan disrupting protesters arrested by Milwaukee police\n\nA 36-year-old man was arrested Monday afternoon after disrupting protesters during the end of a march at Red Arrow Park, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nAuthorities say the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at the park, 920 N. Water St., around 3:20 p.m.\n\nMilwaukee police said the man was arrested, cited and later released.\n\nThe video of the incident, which was posted on X, has more than 6,000 views:\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Gina Castro, Bridget Fogarty\n\nTrump cereal for sale\n\nCrosswords lovers can have a Trump-themed start to their morning with a MAGA-branded cereal available for sale.\n\nIn the “soft” pedestrian zone, Milwaukee residents Crystal King and another person employed by the Trump campaign hung up posters advertising Trump cereal boxes that promises “greatness in every bowl.” They said it tasted like Fruity Pebbles.\n\nBoxes are $30 a pop, or $20 if you’re willing to forgo the cereal inside it.\n\n“Missing those lively family discussions? Trump Cereal is your new table centerpiece,” the website says. “It's not just about the crunch, but the conversations it sparks — from light-hearted banter to deep political chats.”\n\nThe crossword puzzle on the back includes phrases like “fake news,” “crooked Hillary” and we won’t spoil the rest.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nCanary Coffee seeing more customers 'for a Monday'\n\nCanary Coffee, just outside the hard security perimeter at 720 N. King Dr., saw an uptick in business on the first day of the convention.\n\n“A lot more business than normal for a Monday,” said employee Josh Beamsley, adding the customers are not their normal clientele.\n\nIn preparation for the big week Canary Coffee stocked up on extra ingredients including double the amount of milk it normally has.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nResearchers surveying protesters for study on contemporary U.S. politics\n\nStudent volunteers were surveying protesters at Red Arrow Park on Monday afternoon to understand why people choose to protest and the impact protests may have on contemporary politics in the U.S. The survey is funded and led by Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nMichael Heaney of the University of Glasgow and his team have surveyed about 140 people at the RNC in Milwaukee so far. He’s also surveyed protests at previous RNC and DNC conventions in 2008 and 2016. In comparison to previous RNC protests, this year’s is less organized and smaller, Heaney said, possibly due to the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n“It may make the protests smaller because people are nervous about political events. I would project marginally smaller and marginally more intense protests,” he said.\n\nSasmit Rahman, 22, and Emily Chu, 22, traveled to from Minneapolis to march on the RNC. Rahman said they are looking forward to the results of the survey specifically around race and gender of protesters. Chu is interested to learn how people’s emotions may push them to attend protests.\n\n“I think it’s interesting to see whether it’s fear or hope that motivates people more,” Chu said.\n\n— Gina Castro\n\nNorth Carolina delegate loves Trump’s VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina delegate Pauline Bruno gushed about Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\n“We are so pleased,” she said in a seersucker blazer and Trump-printed shoes she bought on Etsy.\n\nBruno loved Vance’s focus on the Rust Belt in his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that she read two years ago.\n\nMilwaukee has been “so welcoming,” she said. She praised the police and said she had “no concerns” about security.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nGuests and delegates appeared to be in high spirits as they wandered downtown Milwaukee after the first afternoon of the convention.\n\nAsif Shahzada, a Wisconsin delegate and La Crosse resident, said the energy was “wonderful” inside Fiserv Forum when Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“I love Trump’s policies,” Shahzada said. “Everybody is energetic. It’s fun to meet other delegates.”\n\nShahzada, who recently immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan, is attending the RNC for the first time this year and said he’s already met people from at least five other states. He owns and operates The Sushi Pirate, a restaurant in downtown La Crosse.\n\nFor other convention-goers, it’s far from their first rodeo: Floyd Brown, a Phoenix resident, said he’s attended every RNC since 1984, save for the mostly virtual convention during the pandemic.\n\n“The party is more unified than I’ve seen in decades,” Brown said after the delegate roll call. “It’s more somber this year, but people are also very upbeat.”\n\nBrown, who is an invited guest at the convention, is also a political commentator and author of “Counterpunch,”a 2023 book advocating for peaceful resistance against leftist movements. He said he feels the Republican party has unified in the face of rising political division, especially given the assassination attempt on Trump just days before the convention.\n\nBrown is attending the RNC with his wife, Mary Beth, who said she was excited by Trump’s announcement of Vance as his running mate this afternoon.\n\n“I think he’s going to do an excellent job,” Mary Beth Brown said of Vance.\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nBobby Flowers, florist at Marius Bell Floral & Design, arrived at the Milwaukee Public Market around 11 a.m., and as of 5:30 p.m. said he's never seen the market so empty on a Monday.\n\n\"It's been dead,\" he said. \"There's usually a lot of tourist traffic here on Mondays, and it's just been so quiet today. It feels so strange.\"\n\nAs of 6 p.m., only eight patrons were seated in the market's upstairs dining area with roughly 20 to 30 patrons shopping or dining on the main floor. Five open tables were available at St. Paul Fish Co.\n\nOutside at the St. Paul Palapa tiki bar, all bar stools were occupied.\n\n— Rachel Bernhard\n\nA photo posted on X shows British comedian and actor Russell Brand, a Trump supporter and conservative internet personality, walking around downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe post says he was seen taking photos with fans and police officers near the Baird Center.\n\nBrand is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts music recital hall, and at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield on Wednesday.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke Monday evening called the Coalition to March on the RNC protest “extremely smooth and safe.”\n\n“I was really pleased with everyone, I think globally,” said Goyke, who observed the march on the first day of the Republican National Convention. “We had protesters and counter protesters. Everyone that was here seemed well organized, there was communication, law enforcement were everywhere they needed to be, communicating with individuals.”\n\nHe said he and his staff would be out in the coming days as well to monitor areas people are expressing their First Amendment rights and how government responds if an incident does occur.\n\nHe also said he got to talk with the Columbus Police Department’s 13-member Police Dialogue Team that was also out at the protest.\n\nIt’ll be interesting, he said, to see whether Milwaukee pursues a similar team at its own police department.\n\n“It’s a special team with training and background to go into protests or potential civil unrest, these kind of emotion-filled environments, and I thought they did a great job today,” he said.\n\nCommunication ahead of time helped ensure everyone was on the same page, Goyke said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nPopular Wisconsin beer sparks political discussion\n\nSpotted Cow, the beer from the New Glarus Brewing Company, prompted the start of a discussion about the beer and its place in Wisconsin culture and politics.\n\nPolitico correspondent Adam Wren reported that Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told a passerby that Spotted Cow is pretty good, “but the owner is ultraliberal. Leinenkugel’s is the conservative one.”\n\nHowever, social users have also made their opinions on the beer and the senator’s criticism.\n\nJournalist Robert Evans said that Wisconsin should be proud of Spotted Cow.\n\n“My primary takeaway from the Milwaukee RNC: Spotted Cow is an excellent beer, shocked by how good it is,” Evans said in an X post.\n\nX user Josh Geise (@joshgeise) said, “Was at Kohler this weekend. Had my first Spotted Cow. So glad to hear it’s ‘ultraliberal.’”\n\nAnother X user, Chaddy (@brewcity43) said, “Spotted (C)ow is okay, and (Leinenkugel’s) is average, as well.”\n\n– Angelika Ytuarte\n\n50 Cent will not attend the RNC, rep says\n\nFollowing reports that rap icon 50 Cent was in discussions with Republican officials about appearing at the convention, his representatives told TMZ that he will not be attending.\n\n\"He is not attending (the RNC), as he is slated to be in Shreveport preparing for his ‘Humor and Harmony’ festival,” his rep said\n\nThe business mogul, born Curtis Jackson, made a post on X on Saturday of his iconic 2003 album cover but instead replaced himself with Trump.\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse looking for patrons\n\nDoc’s Smokehouse setup a pop up Beer Garden just outside of the hard security zone and not many people have shown up throughout the first day of the convention.\n\n”I think the security measures are more restrictive than we anticipated so it’s really difficult for people to get here,” Brent Brashier, owner of Doc’s Smokehouse, said.\n\nHe added there is an exit right in front of the beer garden but not many are going through that way.“Not really anybody knows it’s an exit because it’s padlocked,” Brashier said.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nModel Amber Rose spotted around Milwaukee\n\nMilwaukeeans have seen popular model and TV star Amber Rose around the city in recent days after she announced last week she would be a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter spotted the model, rapper and television personality eating at the Tupelo Honey Southern Kitchen & Bar in downtown Milwaukee Sunday afternoon. Fans gathered around the model and took photos with her, including one resident who snapped a selfie with Rose outside the restaurant.\n\nThe popular television personality has been trending on social media following her announcement back in May that she was in support of former President Donald Trump. Rose announced on July 8 on X that she would be a speaker for the RNC.\n\n— Adrienne Davis, Quinn Clark\n\nJason Storms criticizes Republican Party's abortion stance\n\nJason Storms, national director for Operation Save America, appeared outside the Marcus Center around 5 p.m. to criticize the Republican Party for not taking a stronger stance on abortion.\n\n“We’re committed to the protection of preborn children,” said Storms. Storms was scheduled to speak at Haymarket Square at 4 p.m. but relocated because it was deserted.\n\nWhen the Republican Party finalized its platform this week, it did not include language calling for a national ban on abortion.\n\nThe platform stated: “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those rights.”\n\nAccording to its website, Operation Save America argues a “biblical worldview must govern all areas of both our private and public lives.” It is known for displaying graphic images of aborted fetuses as part of its anti-abortion advocacy and has stated that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty. Storms is the son-in-law of anti-abortion extremist Matt Trewhella.\n\nStorms was accompanied by several of his teenage children, who held large banners with anti-abortion imagery and quotes from the Bible.\n\n— Alex Groth and Cleo Krejci\n\nAttendee mixes RNC with her bachelorette party\n\nTemperatures have remained steadily in the high 80s across Milwaukee’s downtown.\n\nAnd as the afternoon has chugged along, Milwaukee’s Deer District has started to fill out with delegates, guests and volunteers spilling out from Fiserv Forum, seeking out cooling refreshments at local establishments like freshly opened New Fashioned, and its veteran neighbors, The DW Pub and The Mecca.\n\nConservative nonprofit Turning Point Action blasted out from speakers, ringing loudly throughout the plaza, discussing the recent pick of J.D. Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\nFor Texan delegate alternate Rachel Sikes, it’s where she’ll celebrate her bachelorette party as the table calls for more cheese curds at The New Fashioned\n\n“It was just happenstance,” she said.\n\nShe’s getting married July 27. So far, they’ve enjoyed drinks on Lake Mendota in Madison, where they're staying.\n\nShe said she was OK with the vice presidential choice.\n\n“It wasn’t my first choice, but I support the president,” she said.\n\n— Vanessa Swales and Jordyn Noennig\n\nSenate candidate Rejani Raveendran campaigns at Red Arrow Park\n\nRejani Raveendran, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, was introducing herself to people in Red Arrow Park Monday afternoon to encourage them to vote for her in the Republican Party primary election Aug. 13.\n\nRaveendran was the first Republican candidate to challenge Tammy Baldwin, and will run against Eric Hovde inthe GOP primary. A U.S. citizen who immigrated from India and lives in Stevens Point, Raveendran worked as a nurse and is now at UW-Stevens Point, earning her degree in political science.\n\nShe said she's concerned about food and gas prices, border security and homelessness.\n\n“I just want to do what I can because I do not trust any politicians,” she said.\n\nRaveendran said she wasn't invited to speak at the convention and has received several phone calls from Republican leaders, asking her to step down and support Hovde.\n\n“I said I cannot do that, because I do not want to betray the people,” Raveendran said.\n\n— Bridget Fogarty, Gina Lee Castro\n\nWisconsin Republican Chairman Brian Schimming praises J.D. Vance as VP pick\n\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming praised Trump’s vice presidential pick Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance as someone with a “compelling personal story” and said Vance’s Midwest ties could help Wisconsin Republicans.\n\n“As with most swing states, we’re looking for surrogates. We’re looking for people who can come in and identify with voters quickly,” Schimming said. “And he can do that.\"\n\n“That’s why it makes a difference,” Schimming added. “He can roll into a state like Wisconsin and immediately click. So anytime he wants to come to Wisconsin, I will put him in the car and personally drive him around.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s opposition to abortion, Schimming said Trump is the candidate “driving the issues and driving where people are.”\n\n“Donald Trump has not been laid back about saying, ‘Look, I’m not signing a national abortion ban,” Schimming said.\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nWarm weather cools off sales for Convention Fest\n\nWalking outside in near 90 degree weather isn't an ideal shopping environment, but that was the case for the first day of Convention Fest.\n\nMonday, dozens of vendors showed off their products or services to credentialed delegates, media and other officials.\n\nMadan Raj, founder and president of Bobbletopia, started his company in Omaha, Nebraska, four years ago and quickly moved to Milwaukee.\n\nRaj had several versions of Trump in presidential form, but also as William Wallace from the movie \"Braveheart,\" and the Trumpinator, inspired by the \"Terminator.\"\n\n“People have taken pictures of the Trump bobbleheads,” Raj said, adding he’s had a few sales but many people have opted to buy items later in the week, so they don’t have to carry it as long.\n\nRaj said he's been working with the Committee on Arrangements for the Republican National Committee to register for the event and drop off his inventory.\n\n“They have great staff behind the scenes who take care of all of that. They set up the tent, the tables were provided. All I had to really take care of was inventory, which I brought in,” Raj said. “We had to set up Thursday and Friday. Secret Service did their sweep on the weekend ... and today, just final setup.”\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nProtest zones draw few demonstrators\n\nZeidler Union Square, one of the city’s two designated protest zones, has been empty for most of Monday, except for a couple dozen security staff.\n\nThere’s been more dog-walkers than protesters, a security staffer said. A small group of about 15 people were in the park earlier in the day.\n\nHaymarket Square, another of the city’s two protest zones, had no protestors at 4 p.m. The platform has been quiet all day.\n\n— Kelly Meyerhofer and Claudia Levens\n\nVance gets official RNC nomination for vice president\n\nHours after former Trump announced U.S. Sen.

Vance was his pick for vice president, the nomination became official at the RNC in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhen Vance entered the arena, he was greeted by cheers and chants of “J.D.” as well as “USA!”\n\nHis welcome seemed to be delayed by an apparent teleprompter malfunction that led to a jam band playing for at least 30 minutes.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\n50 Cent memes flood social media, RNC appearance rumored\n\nJournalists at CNN reported Monday afternoon on X that rap icon 50 Cent has spoken with Republican officials about making an appearance at the convention, according to people \"familiar\" with the situation.\n\nThe rapper and producer for hit television shows has been trending on social media lately following Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, survived a shooting in 2000. On the track “Many Men” from his 2003 album “Get Rich or Die Tryin,” 50 Cent raps about having enemies and people targeting him. The song has become a soundtrack for many on social media after the assassination attempt.\n\n50 Cent posted to X on Saturday his iconic album cover, edited with a picture of Trump instead.\n\n“Trump gets shot and now I’m trending,” he said.\n\nIn early June, 50 Cent and civil rights attorney Ben Crump appeared on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to advocate for more opportunities in the liquor industry. Speaking with CBS News at the time, 50 Cent said that he hadn't decided who he wanted to vote for in the upcoming election but could see Black men \"identifying with Trump.\"\n\n— Drake Bentley\n\nRNC band steps up after apparent teleprompter malfunction\n\nA band was rocking out at Fiserv Forum after House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a teleprompter malfunction at the RNC.\n\nThe band played for about 30 minutes before the teleprompter started working properly again.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nRepublicans, equipment makers address manufacturing at RNC event\n\nMilwaukee-based Association of Equipment Manufacturers hosted a policy-focused event Monday with Republicans Gov. Glenn Youngkin, of Virgina; U.S. Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin.\n\nA panel discussion addressed pro-growth economic policies, which Republicans say are necessary to bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.\n\nIt also highlighted the storied history that manufacturing and mining equipment manufacturer Komatsu have in Milwaukee.\n\nThe event was held at Komatsu’s mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee’s Harbor District.\n\nKomatsu builds some of the world’s largest mobile land machines. Its biggest mining shovel weighs nearly 4 million pounds and has a bucket the size of a two-car garage. In front of the company's mining equipment headquarters in Milwaukee's Harbor District, there's a 60-foot-tall electric mining shovel and 850,000-pound truck on display.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse gets an RNC roll call shoutout\n\nWhen Brian Schimming, chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, welcomed convention-goers during the RNC roll call at Fiserv Forum on Monday afternoon, he gave a shoutout to the GOP’s Wisconsin roots.\n\n“One hundred and seventy years ago, this great party was founded down the road in Ripon, Wisconsin, in a little white schoolhouse,” Schimming said, flanked by former Gov. Scott Walker and others.\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse is yet more proof that there is indeed always a Wisconsin connection.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStreet vendor selling bloody Trump photo and pins for $5 each\n\nA T-shirt vendor is selling Trump merchandise, including a photo and pin of Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFor delegates and credentialed guests looking to get their hands on the golden Trump sneakers for $600, 365 Campaign is selling two pairs outside the Baird Center, sizes 6.5 and 7.5, for $600 each.\n\n“They’re very hard to come by,” manager Anthony Montgomery said. “They sell out quick.”\n\nMontgomery has a pair of his own.\n\n“I just wanted to see what it felt like to walk like President Trump,” Montgomery said. “This is the closest thing to it.”\n\nBefore coming to Milwaukee, Montgomery said the company was selling merchandise in Pennsylvania when Trump was nearly killed by an assassin.\n\n“It felt like a regular rally,” Montgomery said. “President Trump showed up, and I call it the seven-minute speech because that’s literally all he really had before they tried to take his life.”\n\nMontgomery said the shots sounded like fireworks but when he saw people running, that’s when he knew something serious happened.\n\n“I felt disrespected in a sense,” Montgomery said. “I felt like, 'How could they let something like this happen?'”Montgomery said he tried to keep his composure and help out people where they needed it.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nTensions rise between RNC protesters, anti-abortion group at Red Arrow Park\n\nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, an anti-abortion group, is demonstrating in Red Arrow Park, where protesters from the Coalition to March on the RNC are resting after their march.\n\nTensions are high between the anti-abortion group and those who disagree with them. But Coalition security guards formed a barrier around the group as they laid on the ground to demonstrate.\n\nThe group staged a “wedding” between the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party. A woman in white dress spattered with fake blood “married” a man wearing a pool noodle on his nose to represent an elephant trunk.\n\nA person was shouting through a bullhorn at close range to the group, and members of the group shouted back. One member activated a siren sound on his bullhorn.\n\nThis all occurred as speakers affiliated with the Coalition held their own rally feet away on the slab of concrete that in the winter serves as an ice rink.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBiden-Harris campaign criticizes Trump VP pick\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon criticized Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon.\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Dillon said in a statement.\n\nShe also condemned Vance’s stances on abortion, tax cuts and certification of the 2020 presidential election. Vance is staunchly against abortion but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe statement said the Biden-Harris ticket is “focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone and lowering costs” while the Trump-Vance ticket’s “harmful agenda will take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations.”\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler in a Monday statement said, “The stakes of this election just got impossibly higher” as a result of Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate.\n\n“Should Donald Trump win another term in the White House, there’s no question that J.D. Vance would put loyalty to Trump and the GOP’s extreme agenda over the country,” Wikler said. “In election after election, we’ve seen Wisconsinites reject the extreme, anti-freedom Trump-Vance agenda — and they’ll do it again this November.”\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTrump is officially nominated for president\n\nIt's official: Trump was officially nominated for president during the delegate roll call at the RNC Monday afternoon.\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, delivered the delegates that formally put the former president over the top, USA TODAY reported.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America,” he said.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump has his VP pick: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance\n\nA little over an hour before his vice presidential choice was set to be revealed, Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nVance will be \"strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond,\" Trump wrote.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC passes Fiserv Forum\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 passed the northern end of its march route a block from Fiserv Forum early Monday afternoon, crossing the Juneau Avenue bridge about 1:20 p.m.\n\nDespite its size, the group’s chants were largely inaudible to a reporter on the Deer District plaza, where music was playing and at least one interview was taking place over a loud speaker at one point.\n\nThe group stopped for a few minutes outside the entrance to the credentials-only “hard” security zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue. While they were there, their shouts mingled with music on the southeast end of the plaza.\n\nThe group had said its primary goal was to be within “sight and sound” of Fiserv Forum, and its route went right up against the fence that delineates the credentials-only “hard” zone from the security “footprint” where members of the public are able to enter.\n\nIts route took the group closer to Fiserv Forum than the city-designated demonstration area at Haymarket Square Park a bit farther north.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nParental rights, gender ideology take center stage in Heritage Foundation Policy Fest afternoon session\n\nHeritage Foundation researchers promoted traditional family values and bashed gender ideology during the afternoon panel of “Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future.”\n\nHeritage Foundation panelists Vice President of Domestic Policy Roger Severino, Senior Legal Fellow Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Research Associate for the Tech Policy Center Daniel Cochrane criticized the Biden administration's handling of Title IX and children's social media usage in a panel moderated by conservative personality Liz Wheeler in the Bradley Symphony Center.\n\n“We have to take back as parents our God-given right to parent our children, even when it's tough,” Perry said.\n\nBiden, in one of his first executive actions , expanded federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination in regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, including for transgender individuals.\n\nPerry said the first thing she’d like to see Trump do in office is revoke “all guidance” on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“From that first pebble, we see an avalanche of gender identity and orthodoxy in every system in America,” Perry said. “That is the primary responsibility, I think, of the next administration is to make sure that they don't sacrifice children on the altar of woke progressivism.”\n\nCochrane said gender ideology is spreading on platforms like Tik Tok. Panelists criticized youth access to inappropriate social media content and pornography. Cochran said sites like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube should enact age-verification requirements.\n\nPerry also said she wants Biden’s timeline on Title IX to remove expansions on gender ideology rescinded. She blamed teachers’ unions for “outsized influence” over educational policy agenda items like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ curriculum and hosting “drag queens for story hours.”\n\nLGBTQ+ experts say the Biden administration’s expansion of LGBTQ+ protections and gender affirming care has helped combat harassment and discrimination. His policies have earned him the endorsement of LGBTQ+ advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nCombating deep fakes in politics requires quick action but not over-reacting\n\nThe challenges posed by deep fakes in election campaigns are global, but on Monday, Microsoft Corp. addressed them as part of the RNC.\n\nDeep fakes are images, videos or audio recordings convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say. One example in the presidential campaign was a fake voice message claiming to be President Joe Biden urging New Hampshire voters not to take part in the primary election.\n\nMonday at noon, as part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft offered free training in identifying and addressing deep fakes, especially in political campaigns.\n\n“We’re very concerned about what the next few months look like leading into the U.S. election,” Ginny Badanes, general manager of Democracy Forward said in a Journal Sentinel interview.\n\n“I would say anywhere a political leader is talking publicly and being recorded, there’s a risk of that recording being manipulated to make it look like they said something at that event they didn’t say,” she added.\n\nA poorly made deep fake may be easy to identify. Voices that sound robotic, or unnatural speech patterns, are signs. Strange eye movements and a lack of blinking are other indicators. But detection is more difficult in a professionally made deep fake, and some of the most convincing are in local elections, according to Microsoft.\n\nA quick response, pointing people to the correct information, is important when a political campaign has been attacked with a deep fake or other type of false narrative.\n\nHere are some tips from Microsoft:\n\nInitiate an immediate response, based on factual data, that dismantles the falsehoods without amplifying them.\n\nTo start, evaluate the content’s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike AI-generated parodies of their candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech.\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. But if the content crosses ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nBy promptly addressing false claims, you establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent misinformation.\n\nIf it’s a deep-fake video of a candidate, typically there’s a genuine video on which the fake was based. “That is one of the best antidotes, to get that out publicly, and say it’s the real video,” Badanes said.\n\nWhen deep fakes come with a high probability of losing votes, options include calling a press conference, issuing a public statement, or asking for a retraction. When there's a medium risk, options include activating supporter networks to push back, and considering a public statement. Low risk: Do nothing, so as not to amplify the falsehoods.\n\nHere’s a Microsoft quiz to test your abilities: Real Or Not (realornotquiz.com)\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nSevere thunderstorms expected for Milwaukee area in late afternoon and evening\n\nThe National Weather Service says more severe thunderstorms will move into the Milwaukee area late this afternoon and into the evening, peaking between 6 and 10 p.m.\n\nSevere winds, heavy rain and hail are the main threats, though Milwaukee County has a 2-4% chance for tornadoes. Storms are expected to be stronger along Wisconsin's border with Illinois.\n\nThe outdoor Convention Fest is scheduled to end at 5:30 p.m., and the evening official session inside Fiserv Forum runs from 5:45 p.m. until 10 p.m. That means delegates and media are likely to be indoors when severe weather comes through.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRNC uses influencers to reach young voters\n\nThe RNC is using a new method to reach youth voters this week — more than 70 influencers. Youth Advisory Council Co-Chairs Brilyn Hollyhand, 18, and CJ Pearson, 21, lead the effort.\n\n“Young people don't trust billboards, they don't trust pamphlets, they don't trust direct mail, they don’t trust TV ads. They trust people,” Pearson said. “If we can mobilize influencers to fight for America, to come to our side, we can mobilize legions of young people as well.”\n\nAmong them are former Miss Universe judge and social media personality Emily Austin, Mikel Simmons of Bravo’s “Southern Hospitality” and Xaviaer DuRousseau, a creator with conservative organization PragerU.\n\nDuRousseau said influencers help bridge the trust gap between candidates and voters.\n\n“We are able to make the information palatable,” DuRousseau said. “We've gone through all the fluff, we've seen the details. Now, here is a summarized version from me, an influencer, someone that you trust.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention Committee last month announced similar plans to five influencers access credentials in Chicago.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nAnti-abortion protesters rally in Haymarket Square\n\nAbout 50 anti-abortion protesters rallied at Haymarket Square Park around noon.\n\nAmong them was Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director. He said the initial goal was to encourage the Republican Party to strengthen their stance on abortion.\n\nBut after the RNC platform committee announced a softened stance on abortion, Sande turned from “frustrated” to “angry.”\n\n“The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,” he said.\n\nHe said some who find the GOP abortion stance objectionable may stay home from the polls. Others will vote but will avoid enthusiastically door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts, he said.\n\nHe said even if Trump were elected, it would be difficult to pass the kind of anti-abortion legislation he wants — such as a ban at conception or “fetal personhood” protections.\n\nFetal personhood would grant embryos and fetuses legal and constitutional protections that are equivalent to the person who's carrying them at every stage of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts have said any recognition of fetal personhood could have ripple effects far beyond a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions, potentially outlawing in vitro fertilization, embryonic stem cell research and some forms of birth control.\n\n“This is really taking the air out of the tires,” Sande said. “Literally and emotionally, it’s deflating to the base.”\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nCheese curd vendor at Convention Fest brought over 360 pounds of cheese\n\nThere's one vendor at Convention Fest that will undoubtedly be popular: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds, owned and operated by David and Sanita Hofer. They've been in business for 16 years, working about 60 fairs and festivals in the Milwaukee area each season.\n\n\"This is not our first rodeo,\" David Hofer said about introducing out-of-state visitors to cheese curds. He has a sign set up next to the tent that explains the process of making cheese curds.\n\nHofer likes fried and raw cheese curds equally, but \"every time I think I'm getting sick of eating fried curds, I find myself still eating fried curds.\"\n\nHofer first learned about Convention Fest by reading about it in the paper. They went to a trade show, and convention organizers asked them a few months ago if they'd be interested in being a vendor.\n\nHofer, who was working the booth Monday afternoon with his two daughters, was getting customers even before Convention Fest officially started at 2 p.m. And they expected to keep selling even after the event wraps up at 5:30 p.m.\n\nHe found a calculator and estimated he brought 360 pounds of cheese for the curds to Convention Fest, plus 60 pounds of sliced cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches. Those cheeses come from Ellsworth and Plymouth, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I'm just hoping that we can represent the great state of Wisconsin with high-quality food,\" Hofer said.\n\nThere were plenty more Wisconsin vendors outside, including a beef stick stand. Drink Wisconsinbly also had tents and displayed not-so-political signs, such as \"I support fish frys,\" \"Pro-beers & bratwursts\" and \"Vote yes: Brandy old fashioneds.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee City Attorney Evan Goyke observes march\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke and former deputy city attorney Adam Stephens, who's working for the city this week as special counsel, observe the march from the front.\n\nGoyke declined to answer questions. He previously told the Journal Sentinel that he and Stephens would be observing protest activity around the RNC throughout the week.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been a large law enforcement presence around the march. A unit of officers on bicycles were seen staying a couple blocks away from the demonstration.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman has said he wants the department to be largely \"invisible\" when it comes to policing mass demonstrations during the RNC.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC begins, route to go through downtown Milwaukee\n\nHundreds of people started marching at noon Monday.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC has a planned route of heading south on Water Street, across the Milwaukee River on Wells Street, before marching south on Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe group will then cross the river again and march north on Water Street to West Juneau Avenue, then south on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive before crossing the river again at West State Street.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nEvent staff near Haymarket Square are trained in de-escalation\n\nThe first two groups scheduled to speak at the Haymarket Square Park protest zone were no-shows.\n\nThat's according to Ashanti Hamilton, director of the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety (formerly the Office of Violence Prevention). He was at the zone to coordinate the speaker's platform and a group of event security staff in orange shirts.\n\nMost of the staff were community organizers trained in de-escalation and mediation tactics, Hamilton said.\n\n\"These are the most experienced folks that we have in crowd control,\" he said.\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 15 speakers were scheduled to take to the platform, he said. Because the park was nearly empty, at least one group of protesters stopped by, then promptly left, Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the Trump assassination attempt changed the potential protest landscape.\n\n\"I'm just hoping, now that we have heightened tensions, that those things don't boil over into any of the demonstration activities,\" he said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBay View restaurant to donate portion of sales to progressive organizations this week\n\nBay View restaurant Heirloom MKE, 2378 S.

About a handful of security staff wearing bright orange T-shirts are scattered throughout the area.\n\nAt around 11:40 a.m., three people at the square's pavilion briefly read testimonies from both local and national victims of gun violence, attracting one spectator.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nRipon's Little White Schoolhouse replica at RNC built by high schoolers\n\nA replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, is on display at the RNC's Convention Fest outside the Baird Center and Panther Arena.\n\nA one-third scale replica of the schoolhouse, constructed by Ripon High School students for parades and city events, will be on display at the RNC.\n\nThe full-size schoolhouse was Ripon's first public school, built in 1853, and is now more popularly known as the Little White School House, the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\"We are so excited to have a way to showcase the incredible history that took place here in Ripon 170 years ago,\" Ripon Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mandy Kimes told the Fond du Lac Reporter. \"This is Ripon’s unique history and contribution to the development of our nation.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee firefighter staffing double for RNC, union president says\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department is staffing about double its normal number of workers for the RNC.\n\nEric Daun, the president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said that, on an average day, there are about 200 firefighters staffed around the city, but there’s “well over 200” additional staff for the convention.\n\n“I would say the members are being taxed to the max of their capacity,” Daun said. “We’re doing it to the best of their ability. I’ll say that.”\n\nHe said the department is getting help from suburban Milwaukee County departments. However, unlike with the police, there’s no out-of-state help.\n\n“Stress is at a higher level, but it is what it is. It’s to be expected,” Daun said.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said the department had responded to a handful of minor incidents Monday morning. Overall, he said the day was going well.\n\n\"We got a lot of the kinks out on Sunday,\" he said. \"We're feeling OK with things out here.\"\n\n— David Clarey\n\nAbout 500 people gather for Coalition the March on the RNC rally at Red Arrow Park before march\n\nWith a rally underway ahead of the noon march by the Coalition the March on the RNC, a crowd of about 500 has gathered at Red Arrow, so far smaller than what organizers said they anticipated, about 5,000.\n\nAttendees have come from across the country to bring attention to a range of issues.\n\nCharlie Berg came from Minneapolis with the Climate Justice Committee. He said the Democratic and Republican parties have both failed to address climate change.\n\n“We need a platform and policy that is actually going to address climate change and we can’t do that so long as we have U.S. militarism, so long as we have reliance on fossil fuels, and so long as those corrupt parties are in power,” Berg said.\n\nBadger Van Grey, who is hosting a sign-making station, said the most common signs have included a focus on immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, “We can no longer afford the rich” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nA handful of counter-protesters are at Red Arrow, deriding LBGTQ+ people and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA speaker with the group said he was from Indiana and identified himself only as Jim with Street Preachers. The man protested outside the 2016 RNC in Cleveland and has appeared on college campuses for many years.\n\nSome march attendees stood around the small group to film them but there were few interactions.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\nJournal Sentinel's JR Radcliffe, Kristin Brey preview RNC in Milwaukee\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC protesters speak about Gaza, abortion rights\n\nAs hundreds gathered in Red Arrow Park Monday, Kobi Guillory, a Chicago teacher and central committee member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization, kicked off the press conference with a focus on Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Our government, in a bipartisan initiative, is committing genocide in Palestine with our tax dollars and reinforcing daily militarism,” Guillory said.\n\nAhead of the march, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said he expected the top issues for marchers would be abortion rights and standing with Palestinian people.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has retaliated with an intense military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including women and children, medical authorities in Gaza have said.\n\nSeveral people told the Journal Sentinel they had come from Atlanta and Minnesota with Gaza top of mind.\n\nVictoria Hinckley, who said she was expelled from the University of South Florida for her involvement in a Palestinian-solidarity encampment there, attended the march with others from Students for a Democratic Society. Hinckley’s remarks Monday focused on abortion.\n\n“These attacks on reproductive freedom and abortion access are harshly felt in the South, especially in states like Florida and Texas with the emergence of anti-abortion bills banning abortion within the first few weeks of pregnancy,” she said.\n\n— Rory Linnane and Ashley Luthern\n\nMilwaukee 70-something couple comes to march against RNC\n\nBill Nantell and girlfriend Kathleen Joynt, both in their mid-70s who live near downtown Milwaukee, said they came to Red Arrow Park Monday to march against Republican policies on abortion, racism and senior benefits.\n\n\"I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans,\" Nantell said. \"This is not a Republican Party I am familiar with at all.\"\n\nNantell said he would like President Joe Biden to step aside for a younger candidate. But he will vote for him if Biden stays in.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nStreet evangelists among the few at Haymarket Square Park\n\nA handful of street evangelists stood in a strip of shade on Haymarket Square Park, at North King Drive and West McKinley Avenue, holding signs with Bible verses.\n\nOne man with a microphone was preaching to a near-empty park.\n\nWarren Marquardt of Polk City, Florida, affiliated with Calvary Chapel, said he attends four or five public events a year to spread his message. He recognized the other preachers as regulars at big events.\n\n“There’s no politician that’s going to come on the scene and make it all right,” he said.\n\nStirling Long of Dawsonville, Georgia, affiliated with Providence Bible Church, a Reformed Baptist church, held a sign that read, “Are you going to Heaven? Free test.”\n\nAsked about the Republican Party’s softer abortion stance in its RNC platform, Long said he would not “vote for baby killers.”\n\n“They’re doing it for votes,” he said. “This is a game.”\n\nMarquardt also distanced himself from the GOP stance on abortion, saying, “God will do what God wants to do,” no matter the president in office.\n\nElsewhere along the security perimeter, streets were quiet. Event security staff in orange T-shirts milled around chatting. Police boats trawled the river.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\n'Reagan' movie posters showing up around RNC security perimeter\n\nPosters for an upcoming movie on President Ronald Reagan have popped up around the security perimeter in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Reagan\" stars Dennis Quaid and is scheduled to be released Aug. 30.\n\nThe RNC is also screening \"Reagan\" all day every day in the Regency Ballroom at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center for convention-goers.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nConvention Fest sets up outside Panther Arena\n\nMid-Monday morning, white vendor tents were going up between the Baird Center and Panther Arena for Convention Fest, where those with credentials can experience local food and products.\n\nAmong the 100 local businesses participating in Convention Fest are Immy's African Cuisine and Scrima's Pizza. A Wisconsin cheese curds tent was in a prime location.\n\nIn the center of the road stood a replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, considered to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump expected to announce his VP pick Monday afternoon\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier says Trump confirmed to him he’ll announce his running mate Monday.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nTop names for the spot include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But it’s not out of the question that Trump will make a more surprising pick.\n\nTrump had previously hinted he would announce his VP at the RNC, though that announcement typically came a few days before the convention in campaigns.\n\n— Hope Karnopp and USA TODAY's David Jackson\n\nArtists stage live climate change installation next to RNC security perimeter\n\nA team of actors and artists from Climate Power, a strategic communications organization that seeks to educate Americans on climate change, debuted a public art installation in the windows of the Germania Building, 135 W. Wells St., Monday morning. It’s located just outside the RNC's hard security perimeter.\n\nThe exhibit features five street-facing window displays depicting life-sized scenes of people affected by extreme weather situations, including excessive heat and flooding. Actors will bring to life the experiences of real extreme weather survivors who Climate Power and its partner artists have interviewed.\n\nNew York-based artist Annie Saunders said the installation is inspired by museum dioramas.\n\n“The aesthetic of a diorama is recognizable; it’s usually for history, it’s for prehistory, it’s for things that were frozen in time and are not happening anymore ...,” she said. “So, using that aesthetic to represent something that is happening but is being willfully ignored is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe first window of the exhibit depicts a child’s playroom affected by extreme heat. A small plastic chair is melting, crayon wax is pooling on the table, construction paper pinned to the wall is fading, and the wallpaper is curling at the edges. An actor tries frantically to start an air conditioner.\n\nAnother window shows men in suits sitting around an office table for a business meeting with their heads literally stuck in a pile of sand in the middle of the table. File cabinets in the hallway leading to the meeting room are strewn about and black tar leaks out of them.\n\nSaunders said this represents politicians and officials who “have their heads in the sand” when it comes to the effects of climate change and choose to accept donations from oil and gas companies.\n\n“The problem with climate change is it’s so conceptual, and the language is so saturated ...,” Saunders said. “It’s being communicated with words, which are fundamentally abstract objects, and you have to hear the word and then have a visual or an emotional response.”\n\nDue to the installation’s proximity to the RNC, Saunders said Climate Power hopes to send a message to elected officials and people in power. She hopes the images stick with officials and help them realize that they too could be the victims of extreme weather.\n\n“Extreme heat and these issues do not discriminate on the basis of wealth and power,” Saunders said. “It’s coming for everyone.”\n\nSaunders and the Climate Power team have been working on the installation for over two months and have been setting it up on the Germania Building’s first floor for five days. Passersby will be able to see it through the windows all day Monday and until about noon Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHundreds already gathering at Red Arrow Park for march on RNC\n\nOrganizers with the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 are setting up Monday morning at Red Arrow Park, where they plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. and rally at 11 a.m. before marching in protest outside the RNC.\n\nSeveral hundred people already had gathered at the park by 10 a.m. and the event is expected to draw more than 5,000 people.\n\nOrganizers plan to march within a block of the convention’s main site, Fiserv Forum. They have remained committed to the plan despite heightened anxiety about security in the city after the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nThe coalition plans to avoid the credentials-only “hard” security zone around the RNC but plans to enter the “soft” security zone. While the city has a sanctioned march route in the soft zone, the group plans to take its own route to get closer to Fiserv.\n\nOn Friday, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said the group had a \"handshake agreement\" with city officials that the group would be allowed to use its own route. City officials didn’t confirm such an agreement but confirmed they were working with the group to ensure marchers could safely exercise their rights.\n\nThe “soft” security zone has special rules under the city’s extraordinary event ordinance, including a ban on certain items like non-plastic water bottles, umbrellas with a metal tip, bike locks, and bags larger than 18-by-13-by-7 inches.\n\nThe Coalition consists of local and national organizations, including the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Anti-War Committee.\n\nWhile the groups' individual missions vary, the Coalition's shared priorities include fighting for reproductive rights, standing with Palestinians and defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ people. Many organizers are also unsatisfied with the Democratic Party and plan to protest the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nMajor Goolsby's teams with Broken Bat Brewing to release Screamin' Eagle Lager\n\nIf there's a official beer of the RNC, it might be at Major Goolsby's.\n\nThe well-known sports bar, just on the outside of the convention hard security zone, partnered with Broken Bat Brewing Company to release Screamin' Eagle Lager.\n\nThe restaurant describes the beer as \"crisp, refreshing.\" It's available in 16-ounce cans \"until we sell out!\"\n\n\"A beautiful spin on our traditional Eagle, all artwork was down by our very own Orissa Camille,\" the restaurant wrote on Facebook. \"Get them while they last!\"\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nLong lines form at security checkpoint outside RNC\n\nA long line of cars and other vehicles had formed by 8 a.m. along North Water Street, leading up to a security checkpoint on West Michigan Street near North Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe cars were waiting to go through one of the five security checkpoints along the edge of the security zone surrounding the RNC.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel were instructing drivers at the checkpoint on West Michigan Street to open the hoods of their vehicles, roll down all windows and remain in their vehicles. Once at the checkpoint, law enforcement opened each vehicle’s trunk to check inside and walked a canine around the vehicle.\n\nFrom near the front of the line at 7:45 a.m., Olivia Rivers of Racine said she had been waiting in line about an hour and a half. She works at the 3rd Street Market Hall and had gotten in line about 6:20 a.m. She was supposed to start work at 7.\n\n“The Market Hall told us we’d need an extra hour of travel time,” she said. “I didn’t figure it would take this long.”\n\nBritney Carter of Milwaukee also works inside the security zone and was late to work Monday morning because of the delays.\n\n“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said.\n\nShe works at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and waited in line for about 40 minutes.\n\nAvery Leo, who lives in the security zone, also didn’t expect the long wait and said he would consider taking a different route to get home.\n\n“It’s annoying,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nDowntown RNC 'soft' security zone quiet\n\nThe downtown “soft” security zone/footprint where pedestrians can freely cross inside, was quiet Monday morning.\n\nPedestrians with various levels of credentials — or not — walked through and police at the fences denoting the credentials-only “hard” zone seemed relaxed. A few vehicles moved through the area.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMicrosoft has 'deep fakes' training at noon and 5 p.m.\n\nAs part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft Corp. is offering free training in Milwaukee on Monday aimed at helping political campaigns, activists and party officials identify and address deep fakes, which are images or videos convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say.\n\nThe sessions, focused on women, democracy and elections, are at noon and 5 p.m. at Northern Lights, an event venue at 106 W. Seeboth St. Speakers will include Ginny Badanes, general manager of the Democracy Forward campaign; and Republican U.S. Reps. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma; Burgess Owens of Utah; and Kat Cammack of Florida.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRon Johnson chart credited as difference-maker in Trump assassination attempt\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson may have played a serendipitous role in Trump surviving the Saturday assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat’s because Trump, as he detailed in an interview with the New York Post, turned his head slightly the moment before shots were fired to read a chart on illegal immigration. The source of that chart? Johnson, who spoke about it on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier.\n\nIn an interview with Baier, the senator said he initially showed a chart on illegal immigration to Trump on a plane ride to a rally in Green Bay. The senator said that Trump liked the chart, and his team took it, tweaked it and used it at the Saturday rally.\n\nA bullet pierced Trump's right ear, but he wasn't seriously injured.\n\n“I’m happy to have been of service there,” Johnson said on the Fox News program.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nPolice make two arrests Sunday near RNC security zone, welcome party\n\nPolice made two arrests near the Republican National Convention grounds and its events Sunday.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said both incidents involved drunk people. One person was arrested near the Summerfest grounds, near where a convention welcome party was being held, and another was arrested after driving into a security barrier near the convention.\n\n“The events overnight were described to me as really uneventful,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “There’s been a lot of preparation that’s gone on into the planning of this political convention and the bulk of that planning has been directly involved in and around the area of public safety.”\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: It'll be a hot, humid day, with a chance of storms Monday night\n\nThe weather forecast looks hot for the convention's first day.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 89 degrees around 5 p.m., with a heat index of 95, according to the National Weather Service. Heat indices in the 90s are expected between 1 and 8 p.m. High humidity is also in the forecast throughout the day, causing things to feel \"uncomfortable,\" said Milwaukee-Sullivan NWS meteorologist Marcia Cronce.\n\nThe heat and humidity should feel similar to Sunday, when Milwaukee County was under a heat advisory. However, a heat advisory isn't expected to be issued Monday because heat indices will be just below 100 degrees instead of at or over 100, Cronce explained. Still, the Weather Service urges people to stay hydrated, limit time outside and take other precautions to prevent heat-related illness.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are possible between 7 p.m. and midnight, with chances peaking at 62% around 9 p.m. Some storms could be severe, Cronce said, with damaging winds being the main threat.\n\nHeavy rain, hail and even tornadoes are possible, Cronce added. The risk for severe storms is more likely near the Illinois border. Brief, heavy downpours are likely but shouldn't stay over single areas for extended periods.\n\nThe hot weather should subside by Tuesday after a cold front moves in overnight, Cronce said.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Monday\n\nThe first official session of the convention starts at 12:35 p.m. and runs until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m.\n\nHowever, the day is littered with events before and after the official sessions.\n\nThe events kick off at 8 a.m., with The Heritage Foundation’s policy-centric event called the Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future and state delegation breakfasts throughout the early morning. Other events include things like a screening of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events.\n\nThe City Channel will broadcast the Republican National Convention beginning at 6 p.m. Monday. It'll air 24/7 and end at midnight Friday. Viewers can watch via Spectrum Cable on Channel 25 as well as on the “Livestream 1” feed.\n\nOther coverage will be available through Spectrum News and Fox News Media.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; group receptions; groups like Moms for Liberty, the American Jewish Committee and the European Union will host events; and there will be more movie screenings, too.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson strikes tone of unity\n\nIn a briefing outside City Hall early Monday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he would avoid focusing on political differences in light of the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nJohnson, a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, instead struck a tone of unity.\n\n“While Democrats and Republicans differ substantially on how we get there, the fact of the matter is … that we all want people of this country to succeed,” he said. “We want families in Milwaukee to have the opportunity to thrive. We want financial stability. We want peace, we want growth, we want health for citizens here, across our state and across our country.”\n\nJohnson also said he thought Biden was “showcasing leadership” in the wake of the attack on Trump by pausing political ads and events.\n\nHe also acknowledged the presidential election rematch between Trump and Biden in November.\n\n“Although the president may not be engaging in political activity in this specific moment in light of what’s happened, I’ve got no doubt that those things will continue,” Johnson said. “Obviously, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago next month and the president will have the opportunity to showcase the difference between his policies, what he’s done, what he intends to do for the United States and its people in the future.”\n\nHe said he was looking forward to serving as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention and working to ensure Biden wins a second term in November.\n\nJohnson said he felt “great” about having the RNC in the city, saying he wanted the event to serve as a stepping stone toward further growth.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nRNC security plan 'strengthened,' Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service has \"strengthened\" its security plan in the wake of Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement Monday morning.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Cheatle’s statement said.\n\n“In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump's detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nThe statement comes a day after the Secret Service’s RNC coordinator, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, said the agency was “not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans.”\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Cheatle said the security plans for events like the RNC are “designed to be flexible.”“As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee,” she said.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny after a gunman was able to shoot and injure Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania from a nearby rooftop. One man, Corey Comperatore, was killed and two people were injured, and Secret Service snipers killed the gunman, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick. Asked whether a running mate would join Trump on stage Monday, Bossie said: \"I don't get ahead of him, but that's — the plan is, it's imminent, for certain.\"\n\nTrump’s motorcade arrived Sunday night at the Pfister Hotel, where many expect he'll be staying.\n\nSecret Service agents lined the perimeter and eyed the surrounding rooftops as dozens of SUVs pulled up to the storied hotel.\n\nTrump, however, could not be spotted exiting his vehicle. A tent was waiting outside the entrance, and security quickly pulled the curtains shut.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC 2024 will continue as planned Monday\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route Monday.\n\nOn Friday, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with the Milwaukee Police Department and the city attorney’s office, though city officials didn't confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed the route with the city Saturday night.\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. Monday, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at noon. The group currently only plans to march Monday.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R.

There will also be disruptions to the County's paratransit service, Transit Plus, for riders with disabilities.\n\nBublr Bikes, Milwaukee's bikeshare system, will shut down seven of its stations until Friday. The stations are all located downtown in and around the security perimeter.\n\nMilwaukee's Hop streetcar will run on a normal schedule from 5 a.m. to midnight and arrive every 15 minutes.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhen does the RNC start? When is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe RNC begins Monday, July 15.\n\nHow long does the RNC last? What are the RNC convention dates?\n\nThe convention runs four days, from Monday, July 15 through Thursday, July 18.\n\nHow to watch the RNC convention\n\nThe convention venues are closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers. However, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. FOX News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\nWhat's the RNC 2024 convention schedule?\n\nHere's the master schedule of events for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe convention is closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; affinity group receptions; lectures and presentations; and film screenings.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; be sure to consult the master calendar for information on how to register.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat's the RNC convention location?\n\nFiserv Forum, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, is the main venue for the RNC. That's also where the first Republican debate was held in August. Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC. Those attendees already have credentials to get inside the convention venues.\n\nIn other words, you can't buy a ticket to get into the convention if you're a member of the public.\n\nBut there are other RNC-related events that are open to the public.

But before checking in with his American counterpart, the cricket-loving prime minister caught a baseball game.\n\nAt the White House, Sunak and Biden held wide-ranging talks dominated by global security, the dangers (and benefits) of artificial intelligence and economic concerns from Ukraine to stubbornly high inflation.\n\nThe two leaders said at a joint White House news conference that they had reached an agreement that would improve cooperation between the two countries on clean energy transition, development of emerging technologies, and protecting technology that is critical to national security.\n\n\"The global economy is undergoing the greatest transformation that has occurred since the industrial revolution,\" Biden said at the start of their Oval Office meeting.\n\nSunak arrived in the U.S. capital late Tuesday. On Wednesday, the first full day of his trip, he laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery, met with business leaders and senior lawmakers, and attended a baseball game between the Washington Nationals and Arizona Diamondbacks, although he declined a chance to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\n“As you guys know, my sport is more cricket than baseball,” Sunak told British reporters on the flight over.\n\nA quick recap on Rishi Sunak: Who is he?\n\nSunak, 43, is the fifth British prime minister to hold the role in seven years. He replaced Liz Truss, who latest all but two months on the job. She succeeded the mercurial, gaffe-prone and COVID-lockdown avoiding Boris Johnson. Sunak is Britain's first leader of South Asian descent, its first Hindu prime minister, and the nation's first leader of color. He is the youngest prime minister of modern times.\n\nA former investment banker and finance minister, Sunak is Oxford-brainy (and Stanford, where he got his MBA), married to the heir to one of India's wealthiest technology company fortunes and, despite his globalist credentials, supported Britain's politically populist decision to the leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\nBritain's first PM of color:Rishi Sunak completes his comeback\n\nWhen Rishi met Joe: What's the personal chemistry like?\n\nRonald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. George W. Bush and Tony Blair. Theresa May, and, uh, Donald Trump. Sunak and Biden aren't quite − yet − the trans-Atlantic political power duo that has long defined the so-called special relationship, a storied partnership between the U.S. and U.K. built on close political, economic and cultural ties (along with a heavy helping of myth-making by journalists and historians).\n\nWhen they met in San Diego in March as part of a security conference, Biden teased Sunak about the latter's vacation home in Santa Monica. There is lingering disagreement about what Brexit means for peace in Northern Ireland, a subject close to Biden's heart. Sunak has made it clear he views Biden's subsidies to the U.S. green energy sector as a form of trade protectionism.\n\nA few times, Biden has mispronounced Sunak's name, including during an event at the White House to mark the Indian holiday Diwali. But on the biggest issues of the day the two leaders appear to be on the same page. Not least: the need to arm Ukraine as it fights off Russia's invasion, and concern over what China's rampant technological and military ascendency means for global security.\n\nAt the start of Thursday's meeting, Biden noted the history between the U.S. and the U.K. and the conversations between previous presidents and prime ministers such as Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.\n\n\"It's daunting to think of the conversations our predecessors have had in this room, when they had to speak of wars they fought together, peace they won together and incredible change in the lives of our citizens,\" Sunak said.\n\nWhat to do about AI, and who to do it with\n\nBefore leaving for Washington, Sunak said he hoped that his meetings with Biden would focus on security in the broadest possible sense. Still, one area that is extremely specific is to do with artificial intelligence and what to do not only about its rapid rise and consumer accessibility, but its potential to impact everything from jobs to battlefields.\n\nReports in the British media indicated that Sunak intended to pitch Biden on the idea of the U.K. playing a leading role in helping to craft some form of global regulatory body or framework for AI.\n\n“No one country can do this alone,” Sunak said Wednesday. “This is going to take a global effort.”\n\nSunak made this case himself in an interview with British broadcaster Channel 4 News on Thursday, saying \"when it comes to AI, the facts are clear: outside of America, the U.K. is unquestionably the leading country − democratic country − when it comes to AI research, AI companies, AI expertise. So I think it is natural that we would seek to play a leading role in shaping the regulations for AI for the future.”\n\nWhy AI alarm is spreading:AI poses risk of extinction, tech leaders warn in open letter\n\nHowever, the U.S. and EU are already discussing a similar idea with a draft for a voluntary code of conduct for AI expected within weeks and thus it remains unclear how much influence the U.K. will be able to bring to this initiative now that it is outside the EU and lacks the collective bargaining strength of the bloc's 27 members.\n\nBiden said the challenges that comes with the advancement of AI technology are “staggering.”\n\n“It is a limitless capacity and possibility but we have to do it with great care,” said Biden, who added that he welcomed the U.K.’s leadership on the issue.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/world/gallery/ukraine-russia-crisis/index.html", "title": "Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "After months of military buildup and brinkmanship, Russia launched an unprecedented assault on Ukraine in late February.\n\nExplosions rang through a number of Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, in a broad invasion that began before dawn on February 24.\n\nBut 100 days later, the invasion has not been the military success Moscow hoped.

Have the global elite ...", "text": "Davos, Switzerland CNN Business —\n\nThe last time top politicians, CEOs and billionaires gathered in a Swiss mountain village to discuss society’s biggest problems and pitch their solutions, the coronavirus outbreak in China was little more than a remote threat. The economy was humming, and a major armed conflict in Europe was on nobody’s list of major risks.\n\nMore than two years later, the world has been upended by the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But for the rich and powerful arriving in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, very little has changed.\n\n“Davos is the epitome of one of the greatest challenges to society right now, which is self-congratulatory elites,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who speaks regularly with many well-known executives.\n\nThe conference — which famously combines high-minded panels with flashy parties — aims to bring important people together to tackle pressing issues like inequality, climate change, the future of technology and geopolitical conflict. But the logic behind inviting some of the wealthiest people on Earth to solve these problems from a resort town looks even shakier these days.\n\nBillionaires added $5 trillion to their fortunes during the pandemic, according to a report from Oxfam published in January. The world’s richest 10 men saw their collective wealth more than double between March 2020 and November 2021. Meanwhile, tens of millions more people around the world were pushed into extreme poverty as the global economy shut down, and many struggling households became reliant on emergency government support.\n\n“The last two years have dramatized and clarified what has been true for some time now, which is an elite plutocratic class is not just leaving the rest of the world behind, but is thriving precisely by stepping on the necks of everybody else,” said Anand Giridharadas, author of the book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.”\n\nThis year’s financial market sell-off has hit the ultra-rich. But that won’t serve as much consolation to people in both developed and many developing economies experiencing the worst cost-of-living crises in decades. Soaring food and fuel prices are already causing hunger and hardship, fanning instability, triggering protests and emboldening political insurgents.\n\nThe 2022 forum was initially scheduled for January, but it was postponed after the outbreak of the Omicron variant. And while organizers have cobbled together a delayed springtime edition that they hope will remain relevant, many heavy hitters have scheduling conflicts or are opting out.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who leads America’s biggest bank, won’t attend the event, which coincides with the company’s annual investor day presentation. US President Joe Biden — who delivered a big speech at Davos in 2017 — will be wrapping up a trip to South Korea and Japan. China’s presence is much reduced, with its big cities still gripped by Covid-19 and its tech titans lying low.\n\nThe main event is likely to be a speech on Monday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is expected to participate via videoconference. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are also scheduled to deliver addresses later in the week, which will be scrutinized as EU countries struggle to agree on a formal oil embargo against Russia.\n\nIn the past, Russian politicians and oligarchs were a fixture of Davos. Founder Klaus Schwab has long emphasized that dialogue and deeper economic ties can promote peace between political adversaries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin delivered a speech at a virtual edition of the World Economic Forum just last year, and was invited to speak to attendees in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n“At this moment in history where the world has a unique and short window of opportunity to move from an age of confrontation to an age of cooperation, the ability to hear your voice — the voice of the president of the Russian Federation — is essential,” Schwab said when introducing Putin in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the CEOs of Lukoil, Sberbank and Yandex were on the list of attendees, along with the country’s energy minister.\n\nThis year, Putin won’t be attending.

Here's ...", "text": "If you’re among the employed Americans who were allowed to work remotely during the pandemic last year, count your blessings. But if you worked from a state other than the one where your employer is based, you may have to pay up for that privilege come tax time.\n\nHere’s why: You are now going to be subject to the income tax rules of two or more states (depending on how many states you worked from remotely last year).\n\nAt the very least you likely will have to file more than one state tax return for 2021, which will cost you more if you’re paying someone else to prepare your taxes.\n\nAnd in some instances – primarily involving five states that have so-called convenience rules (more on those in a minute) – you may even be double-taxed on the same income.\n\nThat’s why the best advice is to consult an experienced tax professional well versed in state tax law to help assess your situation. “Talk to someone. Figure out what the rules are. Then chart out your game plan from there,” said Timothy Noonan, the tax residency practice leader at law firm Hodgson Russ LLP.\n\nEach state makes its own tax rules\n\nAll but nine states impose income tax on earnings. And each one sets its own parameters for determining who must file a return and who owes income tax.\n\nTo say the states’ rules are “all over the map” is apt here.\n\nThere are rules governing taxation of people working remotely for in-state and out-of-state employers. There are rules that will trigger the income tax for non-residents after they work in-state for more than a minimum amount of time or earn a minimum amount of money doing so. And if you worked remotely from a state for more than 183 days last year, you may even be characterized as a resident for tax purposes.\n\nPlainly put, “it is super confusing,” said Lorraine Cohen, partner at Deloitte Tax LLP.\n\nA potential double taxation scenario\n\nMost states assert the right to tax someone’s income on the basis of their physical presence generating that income within its borders, Cohen noted.\n\nSo if your employer is based in one of these states and you worked remotely last year from another state with a similar rule, chances are fair you won’t be double taxed on the same income.\n\nBut your chances for double taxation go up if your employer is based in one of the five states – Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, New York, and Pennsylvania – that have what’s called a “convenience rule.” That rule basically asserts that a state has the right to impose an income tax on wages you earned while working for an employer based in that state, even if you choose to perform your job remotely from another state. The only exception: If your employer directs you to work out of state for its convenience, say because they need you to work at another branch for a period.\n\n“If your office is in a convenience rule state, you can owe taxes both there and in [the other] state on the same income,” said Jared Walzcak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation.\n\nOne example of this: If you were employed by a New York-based organization but chose to work remotely from California last year, New York will tax your income on the basis of its convenience rule. And California would tax your income earned while you were telecommuting from the state.\n\nThe good news: Some states will yield to the state imposing a convenience rule.\n\nOr sometimes, two neighboring states may strike a “reverse credit” agreement that will help a remote worker avoid double taxation, although it may still subject them to a higher tax rate than they would ordinarily pay.\n\nCohen and her Deloitte colleagues offered this example in a recent article for Tax Notes: “An Oregon resident who works remotely in California is only subject to tax in California on the California liability amount that exceeds the Oregon liability amount. In contrast, a California resident working temporarily in Oregon would not have any Oregon tax liability because the California tax rate on wages exceeds Oregon’s tax rate.”\n\nOr neighboring states might strike a “reciprocal agreement” – such as one that exists between New Jersey and Pennsylvania – that will clarify a resident of one state working in the other will only owe taxes to their resident state under certain conditions.\n\nBut you should assume nothing. Instead, get the facts specific to your case before plowing ahead with your 2021 tax returns.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}]}

Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/what-could-floridas-marijuana-market-look-like-under-amendment-3/75083924007/", "title": "What could Florida's marijuana market look like if Amendment 3 is ...", "text": "Florida could soon join dozens of other states in allowing recreational marijuana.\n\nCould.\n\nThe polling on Amendment 3, which would do just that if 60% of voters approve it, has been tight. And voters are caught in a whirlwind of advertisements, with opposing sides presenting sharply contrasting pictures of Florida's future should the marijuana measure pass.\n\nFurther muddying the waters, Gov. Ron DeSantis is denouncing the amendment while former President Donald Trump supports it.\n\nSome things are undisputed. For example, the amendment allows 21-year-olds to possess up to three ounces of marijuana or five grams in concentrated form. And the amendment will take effect six months after approval.\n\nBut what could Florida look like six months after Election Day?\n\nVote No on 3, the anti-amendment campaign, says, “Amendment 3 will change the face of Florida in a way that we will all regret.”\n\nYes on 3 says, “On November 5th, we can give Florida a brighter future.”\n\nA lot of money on the line with Amendment 3\n\nFirst, it’s important to note what Floridians will see on the ballot (or have already seen, via vote-by-mail or early voting).\n\n“This proposed constitutional amendment is estimated to have a net positive impact on the state budget,” reads a bolded section beneath the ballot description. “This impact may result in generating additional revenue or an increase in government services.”\n\nState government economists have estimated that recreational marijuana could bring in at least $196 million and as much as $431 million annually in sales tax revenue.\n\nBut it won’t just be the government that might see an increase in cash. The amendment allows state-licensed medical marijuana providers to sell recreational marijuana, though it also includes language letting the Legislature provide licenses to other entities.\n\nThe current medical marijuana companies are poised to make a lot of green.\n\nTake cannabis giant Curaleaf. It has more than 60 medical marijuana stores in Florida but plans to have more than 80 by the time the amendment could take effect in late spring.\n\nThe company also has been dramatically increasing the capacity of its Florida processing plants.\n\n“We’ve invested this year almost $70 million into Florida,” said Boris Jordan, Curaleaf’s chairman and CEO, in an interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida. “We’ll invest probably another $20 (million), $30 million next year in order to build out our capacity so we can meet the demand of adult use.”\n\nFlorida, boasting the third largest population in the United States on top of being a tourism hotspot, offers a behemoth customer base. Some experts are projecting the state could become the No. 1 marijuana market in the nation – even the world.\n\n“We’re currently increasing our capacity in anticipation of Amendment 3,” said Trip McDermott, chief operating officer of Verano, another leading marijuana company. It has nearly 80 medical marijuana stores in Florida, under the banner MÜV.\n\n“We are currently planning to expand our retail footprint, whether Amendment 3 passes or not, but if it does, we will definitely evaluate on increasing those expansion numbers further,” McDermott said.\n\nHe said there’s always a “wait and see” to get a good understanding of a new market’s demand, but added there's typically a doubled or tripled sales increase. He predicted that would come with a significant economic impact, creating more careers in the cannabis industry.\n\nBoth companies have contributed millions of dollars to Smart & Safe Florida, the group heading the pro-amendment campaign.\n\nBut it’s not close to the amount contributed by Trulieve, Florida's largest medical marijuana operator, with more than 150 stores across the state. Trulieve has donated the vast majority of the around $150 million the campaign has received.\n\n\"We have over two million Floridians who are accessing products through the unregulated and illicit market,\" said Trulieve CEO Kim Rivers during a recent press event at one of its Tallahassee dispensaries. \"It's here. Let's regulate it, let's tax it and let's stop making needless arrests.\"\n\nMedical marijuana power players will expand to recreational\n\nThere are more than 880,000 Floridians who can already legally purchase marijuana. And, as medical card holders, that product isn’t taxed.\n\nWhile some specifics may vary depending on how the Florida Legislature might implement the amendment, the three companies’ representatives say they anticipate their current stores will sell the recreational product – while still offering medical marijuana.\n\n“We absolutely plan to continue to prioritize our medical patients,” Rivers said in an interview. “This is not our first transition from a medical market to an adult-use market. I think we’ve got a good roadmap.”\n\nIt also wouldn’t be the first transition for Curaleaf and Verano.\n\nCuraleaf’s Jordan said, typically, his stores have a specific section for patients. Sometimes, stores have even offered special times they can visit, he said, to avoid the lines that can accompany the launch of the recreational product.\n\nRegardless of what Florida lawmakers do, McDermott said, “We've done this seamlessly in a number of states over the last 30 months,” he said.\n\nIn his view, Amendment 3 expands the medical market, making weed available to people who weren't able to get a medical card because of the cost or other reasons.\n\nWhat will the products look like?\n\nAll three also expressed confidence in being able to have sufficient supply starting out if a recreational market is created.\n\nBut, in terms of what kind of products would be available on the recreational market, the Legislature will play a big role. Rivers said she wouldn’t be surprised if “there is some delineation in products between the medical and the adult-use side.”\n\n“For example, we have a nasal spray that's intended to stop and is very effective at stopping grand mal seizures very quickly. That likely would not be a product that I would certainly recommend for an adult-use customer,” she said. “There’s some common sense that could be injected into the process here.”\n\nJordan is on the same page, pointing to how medical marijuana patients may need dosages far higher than needed by recreational users: “We have medical patients that are replacing opiates with cannabis,” he said. “I would be supportive of some reasonable level of cap on the recreational side.”\n\nOverall, though, he predicted the products would be about the same. So did McDermott.\n\n“They will have access to our current portfolio,” he said. “We'll continue to roll out new products, as we always do.”\n\nWhat could product pricing look like?\n\nLegislative action could play a role in product pricing, too.\n\n“You might get a small temporary spike depending on how the tax is, to just compensate for the tax,” Jordan said. “Eventually prices do start coming in … Competition always forces prices to come in.”\n\nFlorida's market is vertically integrated, which means the companies have to grow, process and sell their own products.\n\n“There might be a little bit of pricing volatility initially, as operators are trying to understand supply and demand curve, but we do anticipate that settling out over the coming months after launch,” McDermott said.\n\nRivers emphasized the importance of providing pricing continuity to medical patients – and also how the Legislature would implement the amendment.\n\n“We expect and anticipate hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to be generated from adult-use marijuana products in the state of Florida that can be injected into our communities and police and schools,” Rivers said.\n\n“We do have to balance and ensure that the product is not overtaxed, so that it is actually available and accessible, and we are encouraging Floridians to transition from getting products off the street,\" she continued.\n\nWhat does pricing look like right now?\n\nA Tallahassee Trulieve sells pre-rolled joints for as low as $7 each, according to its website. For its \"most popular relief option,\" a 3.5 gram allotment of whole cannabis flower can be purchased on sale for as low as $30, with the same amount of \"small bud\" being cheaper.\n\nAt MÜV, a 100-milligram packet of edibles is available for $20, while Curaleaf has 0.5-gram concentrates on sale for under $18.\n\nWho's blowing smoke? Night and day differences in how boosters, critics portray amendment\n\nThe sides for and against the amendment urge Floridians to read it, insisting the language will clearly prove their completely conflicting interpretations.\n\nOpponents, for example, are adamant that it’s written in a way that prevents the Legislature from restricting public use of recreational marijuana. \"This state will start to smell like marijuana,\" DeSantis has claimed.\n\nWhen a USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida reporter asked an anti-amendment campaign official if there was any chance there would be public use restrictions the reply was \"no.”\n\n“We are not able to ban public smoking, and that is a huge problem for most Floridians. They don't want to smell it,” said Jessica Spencer, director of advocacy at Vote No on 3, in an interview.\n\nAmendment supporters call that a “scare tactic.”\n\nSen. Joe Gruters of Sarasota, a former Republican Party of Florida chair and Amendment 3 supporter, joined two other lawmakers a couple of months ago in promoting a plan to restrict public smoking.\n\n“I fully expect to see the Legislature involved,” said Morgan Hill, Smart & Safe Florida's spokesperson, in an interview. Gruters “has a bill prepared to file that would restrict public consumption in the same way that Florida already restricts public consumption of alcohol and tobacco.”\n\nDuring a Tallahassee Democrat and WFSU-hosted debate on the amendment last week, Spencer also claimed the amendment prevents legislative packaging and THC restrictions. That's not something currently written on Vote No on 3's website.\n\nRivers, when asked about that during the Thursday event, said, \"I actually haven't heard that. That seems pretty crazy.\"\n\nThe Legislature has consistently passed bills to accompany passed amendments, sometimes with tweaks that outrage those who pushed for the measures. When Floridians approved the 2016 medical marijuana amendment, for instance, lawmakers initially banned it in smokable form.\n\nBoth sides agree that the amendment won't allow Floridians to grow their own weed — the pro-amendment campaign says including that would've violated the Florida Supreme Court requirement that the language stick to a single subject.\n\nThe opponents nevertheless bash the exclusion and accuse the amendment of outright banning home grow, which supporters say isn't true: \"The Legislature could absolutely do that themselves,\" Hill said.\n\nWould Amendment 3 reduce crime?\n\nAnother divide can be seen on the possible criminal justice effects, with supporters saying Amendment 3 would prevent marijuana arrests.\n\nThat includes Trump. In announcing his support for the measure, Trump wrote on social media, “I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use.”\n\nThose against the amendment shot back that the arrest claims are greatly exaggerated.\n\nAt the same time, the anti-campaign warns of the effect on impaired driving, which the amendment supporters also say is exaggerated and can be mitigated via public safety measures that marijuana tax revenue could fund, which segues into another debate about the \"social cost\" of implementation.\n\nOne campaign says recreational marijuana would reduce crime, the black market and teen use. The other says the opposite.\n\nAnd opponents also contend that the amendment gets rid of any civil or criminal liability for marijuana companies, making them immune to lawsuits or other legal repercussions.\n\nResponding to that claim, Yes on 3 wrote in an email that the language the opposition cites was in the medical marijuana amendment, too.\n\n\"(It has) the sole effect of allowing the use, cultivation and sale of marijuana for adult use in light of its current illegal status under federal and state law,\" it wrote. \"Those provisions do not and cannot provide immunity for other ancillary conduct such as negligent manufacturing, unlawful sales to minors, delivery vehicle accidents, or consumers driving while impaired.\"\n\nBut, at the end of the day, the decision is up to the voter.\n\nFrom Spencer, at the forum: “You don't have to listen to either one of us about it. You just really have to read the amendment and understand what this is truly about.”\n\nFrom Rivers, at the dispensary: \"Make sure that you have the facts, make sure you understand the realities of what this is and what it isn't, and educate yourself.\"\n\nThis reporting content is supported by a partnership with Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.

Trump's \"Unleashing American Energy\" order that references consideration of \"the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs\" appears to include language to eliminate the credit, for instance.\n\nBut policies promoting EV sales are also harder to root out of tax code and Clean Air Act regulations than the executive order might imply, and questions about the president's ability to undo EV-related legislation suggest legal battles ahead.\n\nSean Tucker, writing for Kelley Blue Book, noted that some orders could be subject to court challenges, or they essentially acknowledge that the president can't change laws and instead direct officials to conduct reviews.\n\n\"If there’s one lesson to take from a deep read of the executive orders, it’s that all of these changes will take time and some may be blocked,\" Tucker wrote. \"Agencies will likely change some of the policies Trump has instructed them to change.

That nonbinding Biden directive set \"a goal that 50% of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles.\"\n\nAutomakers get reprieve on EV adoption\n\nEV sales have continued to grow but not at the rates planned for earlier, and automakers have responded to that shift.\n\nStill, the change in tone from one administration to the next is stark, with Trump's orders appearing to target EVs, money for EV charging stations and emissions rules spearheaded by California.\n\nErik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business who follows the auto industry, said Biden’s 2021 order was a signal of EV aspirations while Trump’s revocation is a signal of EV realities.\n\n“Car companies with ICE models have already adjusted to a more realistic timing for EV adoption. They got a reprieve from customers. Now they have one from the government,” Gordon said, referencing an abbreviation for the internal combustion engine. “In a market economy, you can’t sell what people won’t buy, even if the government says you have to.”\n\nKarl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, echoed that.\n\n“Trump made his plans for the electric car mandate clear when campaigning, and his decisive win has given him the confidence to move forward with revoking it. He feels it’s threatening the health of the U.S. auto industry, which, combined with his long-standing preference for a free market approach versus government mandates, makes this an easy decision for him,” Brauer said.\n\nStephanie Brinley, an associate director at S&P Global Mobility, said Trump's actions so far haven't been a surprise.\n\n“Rescinding the soft target that President Biden put in place codifies a change in the focus of President Trump’s administration overall. Whether the U.S. met the 50% EV target by 2030 was less important than the direction that the statement set,\" Brinley said. \"Easing the regulations for emissions and fuel economy will be the next step, and it will give the industry the ability to make better investment decisions in the near term as well. At the end of the day, however, consumers will determine the pace of EV adoption; easing regulations takes one pressure off of the industry to meet those targets, but it will be consumer demand that ultimately sets the pace.”\n\nChange in direction will 'hurt the industry and lead to job losses'\n\nSome industry watchers, however, warn that a significant shift on EVs could ultimately hurt automakers.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights, said scaling back EV production and sales could prove harmful to the industry overall, saying that U.S. automakers aren’t in a position to back out of billions already invested in the shift to electrification.\n\n“They can’t entirely pivot back on a dime,” he said. “We’re going to see a lot of product programs get delayed as they try to shift gears again and that is going to hurt the industry and lead to job losses. If these plants are not being utilized, and if they can’t sell the EVs, the plants, most of which are in Republican districts — those jobs are going to disappear. You’re going to end up with unused empty factories. It’s going to hurt jobs, lead to uncertainty and make the U.S. auto industry less competitive globally. If they’re not pushing forward with electrification, and automakers from other countries are, that’s going to give those automakers an advantage.”\n\nAutomakers and their allies have heard, like the rest of us, what Trump said during the campaign and through their main U.S. trade group have highlighted their interests to him. John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, in a letter to Trump after his election in November, pointed to a range of regulatory concerns and the industry's need to compete with China, but did not seek the end of EVs.\n\nThe alliance on Tuesday issued a statement attributed to Bozzella: \"The president is paying close attention to the competitiveness of the American auto industry. And anyone who has been paying attention knows there’s a mismatch between current EV market dynamics and the emissions and EV sales targets called for in recent regulations — especially in the states that adopted California’s gas-powered vehicle ban and EV sales requirements (that are by any measure not achievable).\"\n\nCalifornia, which routinely is granted exemptions to the federal Clean Air Act to set tougher fuel economy standards, seeks to ban sales of gasoline-powered cars by 2035.\n\n“The country should have a single, national standard to reduce carbon in transportation. We can't have regulations that push the industry too far ahead of the customer,\" Bozzella said.\n\nDetroit automakers react\n\nOn Tuesday, Ford Motor Co. spokesman Richard Binhammer told the Detroit Free Press that “we continue to evaluate the initiatives” and Ford does not have any further comment yet as to what Trump has done or may do in the near future and how it would impact Ford.\n\nBut at the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 9, Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford told reporters he got an unexpected phone call from Trump earlier this month seeking Ford’s input on the auto industry. As the Detroit Free Press reported, Ford said he had a long conversation with Trump and hung up feeling confident that the automaker will “have a seat at the table” with the new administration.\n\n“(Trump) understands the importance of our industry and Ford in the industry,” Ford said on Jan. 9. “He wants to be helpful. I think once he gets his staff together, we’ll probably be able to go a little bit deeper.\"\n\nIn a statement from Stellantis provided by spokeswoman Jodi Tinson on Tuesday, the company said it \"is well positioned to adapt to the policy changes enacted by the new administration. President Trump's clear focus on policies that support a robust and competitive manufacturing base in the United States is hugely positive and we look forward to working with him on the crucial objectives of strengthening our industry and the nation's economy.\"\n\nStellantis owns the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands.\n\nMary Barra, General Motors CEO, has said she expects GM to have a seat at the table in setting auto policy, and on Monday tweeted congratulations to Trump, saying \"@GM looks forward to working together on our shared goal of a strong U.S. automotive industry.\"\n\nSome on Wall Street said Tuesday that Trump’s moves to rescind Biden’s clean air initiative is positive for the Detroit automakers because they can now build a foundation of electric vehicles, but not be forced by government regulations to go fully electric.\n\nDan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the Free Press he also believes that Trump will have a phased wipeout of the EV tax credit this year.\n\n“This will be a multistep process for Trump with the EV emissions, and ultimately GM, Ford, Stellantis will have to adjust to a new normal for the automakers as the EV incentives and 2030 targets slowly get pulled by Trump,” Ives said. “We see hybrids becoming front and center and less aggressive EV targets for the 313 area code going forward.”\n\nUncertain threat of tariffs looms\n\nKevin Mixer, senior director analyst for automotive manufacturing at Gartner, said the new Trump administration’s stated intention to cut incentives and other governmental initiatives aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles could slow purchase rates.\n\n“However, EVs have already established a presence in the market and are gaining traction worldwide,” Mixer told the Free Press. “The U.S. represents just one segment of the global market where automakers compete. Any changes in the administration's priorities might impact the timeline for product releases, but not their eventual success.”\n\nPointed comments from Trump about the possibility or likelihood of imposing tariffs on products coming from Canada and Mexico are also on the minds of analysts and others.\n\nMixer said it's difficult to predict the impact of tariffs until it is known what Trump imposes. But in the short term, Mixer said, “they are likely to increase vehicle costs and impact vehicle demand.”\n\nMorningstar analyst David Whiston said the prospect of increased tariffs worries him for the Detroit automakers.\n\n“I think in the auto industry, everyone is hoping the 25% is not going to be a long-term tariff and I do think Trump is more interested in using tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to do what he wants on fentanyl and immigration than on just hitting them with a tariff,” Whiston told the Free Press in an email. “He’s trying to leverage American buying power to influence immigration and illegal drugs, but it’s dangerous to the Detroit 3 too, especially GM and Stellantis who use Mexico and Canada for production more than Ford does.”\n\nBut he said no automaker is safe because parts cross North American borders many times before ending up in a finished vehicle, even if that vehicle is made at an American assembly plant.\n\n“So a tariff each time will raise prices by at least a few thousand dollars on all vehicles, not just Canadian- and Mexican-made ones,” Whiston said. “The fact that he gave a date of Feb. 1 rather than immediately doing the tariffs, is to give Canada and Mexico a little more time to get a deal done. I’m not optimistic the industry can avoid tariffs, though, for his entire term. Have to hope they are short-lasting.”\n\nAlthough Trump has been vocal about EVs and other issues affecting the auto industry, changes could be influenced by factors beyond executive branch action.\n\nAbuelsamid noted that some of the changes that Trump has touted might have come to pass even without an executive order. He pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on June 28, 2024, that overruled the administrative-law doctrine known as “Chevron deference.”\n\nIn place since 1984, the Chevron deference had allowed federal agencies to interpret ambiguous congressional statutes within reasonable parameters.\n\nSince the current fuel-economy standard is above the latest legislative mandates from the 2007 Energy Act, there is no reason to set the bar higher from a congressional standpoint.\n\n“The current standard is 41/42 (mpg), and will go up to 50 with the current requirements, but that goes above and beyond what Congress mandated,” Abuelsamid said. “Now judges no longer have to defer to regulators; they can stick with what Congress requires. Unless Congress explicitly asks for it, regulators cannot do it. Regulators can do it, I should say, but the courts can void those rules.”\n\nFree Press staff writer Todd Spangler contributed to this report.\n\nContact Eric D. Lawrence: elawrence@freepress.com.

It was a huge step and one that instantly put pressure on other big platforms to take action.\n\nWithin days, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitch had all either banned or indefinitely suspended Trump’s accounts. It marked a sweeping and unprecedented set of actions against a sitting world leader by platforms that had previously taken only limited actions against Trump as he repeatedly pushed the limits of their rules.\n\nLess than two years later, it appears Twitter (TWTR) could be poised to take a similar role in reversing the bans on Trump. Elon Musk on Tuesday confirmed what many in the tech, media and political spaces have been predicting for weeks: If his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) succeeds, he plans to restore Trump’s account.\n\nAlthough Trump has suggested he wouldn’t return to Twitter and will instead remain on his struggling social platform Truth Social, it’s not hard to imagine him changing his mind. Even before he was elected, Twitter was central to Trump’s image, providing him a platform to rally his base, criticize opponents, discuss policy plans and bypass the traditional media to explain his (sometimes untruthful) version of events to tens of millions of followers.\n\nMusk’s acquisition of Twitter is still far from set in stone. There have been questions about the Tesla CEO’s ability to finance the deal if his car company’s stock keeps falling, and Twitter’s share price has hovered well below Musk’s offer price of $54.20. On Friday, Musk said the deal was “temporarily on hold” pending details about the number of spam accounts on the platform. Still, Musk said Friday he remains “committed to acquisition.”\n\nIf Musk’s deal is completed, restoring Trump’s Twitter account could give the former President back his online megaphone ahead of another possible run for the White House. Even more than that, such a move would also likely open the door for other platforms to follow suit.\n\nBeyond the issue of Trump’s own accounts, reversing the ban could reignite a series of other thorny debates for Twitter and its rival platforms, including whether permanent bans should ever be used as a moderation tactic and if public figures or elected officials should be subject to different rules than other people.\n\nReversing the Trump bans\n\nEven before Musk made his stunning bid to buy Twitter, there was pushback in some quarters, including from those politically at odds with Trump, for banning a sitting world leader.\n\nThen-German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the time that Twitter’s ban on Trump was “problematic.” And on Tuesday, after Musk said he would restore Trump’s account, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero lauded the plan.\n\nIf Elon Musk fulfills his promise to return former President Donald Trump to Twitter, other major social media platforms could quickly follow suit. Stephan Schulz/dpa/Getty Images\n\n“You’d be hard-pressed to find a more steadfast opponent of Trump and his policies than the ACLU, but Elon Musk’s decision to re-platform President Trump is the right call,” Romero said in a statement. “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the most important political figures in this country, and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech.”\n\nTwitter founder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey said at the time of the ban that permanently suspending Trump was a difficult decision that came in response to “extraordinary” circumstances. The decision, which was quickly praised by a number of civil rights groups, was made “with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter” and after a clear warning to Trump, he said.\n\nIn the nearly 18 months since then, there has been widespread speculation that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms would eventually review their suspensions of Trump, especially if he decides to launch another bid for the White House in 2024. Unlike Twitter, Facebook and YouTube had implemented indefinite, but not necessarily permanent, suspensions.\n\nFacebook, in particular, is set to review its Trump ban early next year. After the company initially suspended Trump indefinitely, it faced pushback from its oversight board. The company decided it would maintain the suspension until at least January 7, 2023 — two years after Trump was initially removed. Nick Clegg, now the president of global affairs at Facebook-parent Meta, previously said that once the two years ended, Facebook would “look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded” to decide whether to restore Trump’s account.\n\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has also said that its suspension on Trump’s account — which was initially implemented for one week and then extended to an indefinite ban — would eventually be lifted when any “risk of violence” had subsided.\n\nMusk’s deal to acquire Twitter is set to close by the end of this year, and if he acts quickly to reverse the Trump ban, it could give Meta and YouTube an opportunity to observe potential fallout from users and advertisers. Perhaps more importantly, it could also give the rival platforms political cover to make the same move.\n\nTech platforms tend to move in packs on everything from tricky policy decisions to new features. And this may be especially true when Twitter is leading the way.\n\nAlthough far from perfect, Twitter has, at least historically, been viewed as “more nuanced in their content moderation” and as “trying to do the right thing more often than other platforms,” said Kristin Martin, professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “So I do think that whether they reverse the ban or start to allow certain content through, it will make a difference in the industry because they’re leaders.”\n\nMeta and YouTube declined to comment on this story.\n\nTwitter on Tuesday declined to comment on Musk’s plans to restore Trump’s account. Musk said on Twitter Thursday that, “even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter.”\n\nElon Musk has said that if his acquisition deal succeeds, he would return Trump to Twitter and do away with \"perma-bans\" on the platform. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMoving away from ‘perma-bans’\n\nRestoring Trump’s account could be the start of a broader shift for Twitter under Musk’s ownership — and for any other platforms that may choose to follow its example on content moderation.\n\nMany of the platforms have also banned far-right figures such as Milo Yiannopolous and Alex Jones for violating their policies against hateful or abusive behavior, and have removed other accounts — some prominent, some not — for repeatedly sharing conspiracy theories or misinformation.\n\nUnbanning Trump would likely raise questions about whether others should be brought back, and how the companies should handle accounts for whom smaller penalties don’t appear to discourage policy violations. Currently, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all rely on some form of a strike policy for users who violate their rules various warnings and short-term suspensions before permanently removing repeat offenders.\n\nTrump had for years pushed the limits of social media platforms’ content moderation rules before the issue came to a head following January 6. In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Twitter suspended Trump for 12 hours before letting him post again and then ultimately banning him. (Facebook and Instagram, similarly, blocked Trump for 24 hours before indefinitely suspending him.)\n\nMusk, who has repeatedly said his goal is to bolster free speech on Twitter, has expressed a general opposition to the idea of permanent bans for all content except that which violates applicable laws. He said Tuesday that “permanent bans should be extremely rare” and reserved for “bots or spam, scam accounts where there’s just no legitimacy to the account at all.”\n\nBut high-profile suspensions make up only a small portion of the moderation decisions Twitter and other platforms must make. Much more often, they’re dealing with regular users who get suspended or banned for things like frequent harassment or spreading of misinformation, behavior that doesn’t necessarily break any laws but nonetheless makes for an unpleasant experience on the platform for other users.\n\nIf Musk does bring Trump back, online safety experts say it will be important for him to articulate a clear policy around why the decision was made and how the company will handle future violations, with or without a permanent ban as an option. Musk said Tuesday that the Trump ban was a mistake because it “alienated a large part of the country” and did not stop the former President from posting elsewhere online.\n\n“Trump used Twitter to foment a violent attack on Congress,” said Katie Paul, director of the online safety advocacy group Tech Transparency Project. “Others were prevented from using the platform to spread medical misinformation that cost countless lives, from organizing violent militias, inciting violence or persecuting victims of tragedies like Sandy Hook. If he succeeds in buying Twitter, Elon Musk cannot simply shirk the responsibility to ensure that his products don’t kill people.”\n\nMusk is well known for making grand promises, working out the details as he goes, if at all. The same appears to be happening with his thinking on moderation. While generally positioning himself as a free speech absolutist, Musk has so far offered only vague explanations of how he would handle violative content — whether it be from the President or an everyday user — without using permanent bans. “I think if there are tweets that are wrong and bad, those should be either deleted or made invisible, and a suspension, a temporary suspension is appropriate but not a permanent ban,” Musk said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/24/doge-penny-money-saving-currency/77936837007/", "title": "Elon Musk's DOGE: Ditching the penny could save taxpayers billions", "text": "AI-assisted summary Producing pennies cost taxpayers more than it's worth, with each penny costing 3.7 cents to make in 2024.\n\nThe rising cost of metals like zinc and copper contributed to the increased production cost.\n\nOther countries, such as Canada and Australia, have successfully eliminated their lowest denomination coins.\n\nThe newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have a new penny-pinching tactic.\n\nThe U.S. penny, which has been in circulation since the late 18th century, is in the crosshairs of the department run by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. In a post on X on Tuesday, DOGE said producing 4.5 billion pennies in Fiscal Year 2023 cost taxpayers more than $179 million.\n\nThat equates to paying over 3 cents for one penny, the post pointed out, quipping: \"Penny (or 3 cents!) for your thoughts.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump formally established the Department of Government Efficiency this week after signing an executive order. But DOGE’s initial proposed co-chair with Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, is leaving to launch a campaign for Ohio governor. He said in a post on X: “I’m confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government.\"\n\nBillions of pennies were made in 2023\n\nThe U.S. Mint says it circulated around 4.1 billion pennies in 2023. For the 2024 fiscal year, the annual U.S. Mint report said that it takes about 3.7 cents to produce and distribute one penny, a 20% increase from the previous year.\n\nThe increase has been partly driven by the rising costs of metals like zinc and copper, the report says.\n\nPennies have been devalued for a long time\n\nThe idea of getting rid of the penny was not conjured by Musk. In a 2013 article by the St. Cloud Times, part of the USA TODAY Network, Cy Schaefer the then-president of the Great River Regional Coin Club predicted the penny would be gone as soon as the next year.\n\n\"I don't think people care about pennies at all,\" Schaefer said. \"It's excess change. They drop them on the ground.\"\n\nEven in American pop culture, the penny has become a sort of punch line. Although it played an important part in the 1990 movie \"Ghost,\" serving as proof to Molly (Demi Moore) that her dead husband Sam (Patrick Swayze) was communicating with her, a 2001 episode of “The West Wing” took a jab at the coin.\n\n“Majority of pennies don’t circulate. They go in jars, sock drawers,” character Sam Seaborn says.\n\nHow long has the penny been used in the United States?\n\nThe penny has been used for almost as long as the United States has been a country. According to the U.S. Mint, pennies were first introduced in 1793 and were made out of copper back then.\n\nThe penny was actually the first circulating coin in the United States. But even back then, the coins were already causing a stir because of their large size.\n\n“These new cents caused a bit of a public outcry. They were larger than a modern quarter, a bulky size for small change,” the U.S. Mint said.\n\nIn 1857, the penny got reduced to its current size. In 1909, Abraham Lincoln became the first president featured on an coin.\n\nOther countries have gotten rid of small coins\n\nThe idea of getting rid of a small denomination coin like the penny has seen success in other countries around the world.\n\nFor example, Canada stopped making one-cent coins in 2012, while Australia stopped making them back in 1992.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

In turn, Beijing has left its retaliatory tariffs on some agricultural products, including soybeans, and some American-made goods.\n\nThe Chinese tariffs hurt US farmers by making American-grown soybeans more expensive for Chinese buyers, who bought a majority of US exports prior to the trade war.\n\n“We’ve lived with tariffs for so long, it’s just the way we do business now,” said Iowa farmer Dave Walton, who saw prices for his soybeans plummet after the tariffs were put in place in 2018.\n\nHis farm is near the Mississippi River, where his soybeans are usually loaded onto a barge and then sent overseas after reaching the Gulf of Mexico. This location made it easy to export his crop.\n\nBut this year, Walton is trying to rely less on foreign buyers. Instead of exporting his soybeans, he is selling them to a domestic company that will use the crop for seed.\n\nWalton remains frustrated with the Biden administration for leaving US tariffs in place. If trade tensions eased, Beijing may lift the tariffs on US soybeans too. He’s also frustrated that the administration has so far failed to successfully appoint people to two key agricultural trade positions: The chief agricultural negotiator role at the Office of the US Trade Representative and the undersecretary for foreign trade position at the US Department of Agriculture remain open.\n\n“It signals to me that trade is not a priority for the administration. If it was a priority for them, they’d have those trade positions filled and they’d be working on updating trade agreements with China and other countries,” he said.\n\nBiden leaves tariffs in place\n\nEarlier this month, the Biden administration took a first step toward conducting a statutory four-year review of the US tariffs on Chinese goods – but officials have given no indication that the review will result in removing the tariffs.\n\nSo far, the Biden administration has resisted the pressure from the American business community to lift the tariffs, which has ramped up as inflation increases. In an interview last Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said all tools are on the table to address inflation but stopped short of saying whether lifting tariffs should be one of them.\n\nIn 2020, a truce was reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both sides stopped adding new tariffs as part of what’s known as the Phase One deal. Beijing also agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products.\n\nBut China fell well short of its goal, buying only 57% of the US exports it had committed to purchasing by the end of 2021. While agricultural exports to China returned to 2017 levels, they fell short of China’s commitment. Soybean exports fell more than 30% short of the target.\n\nBiden suggested earlier this year that China’s failure to meet its commitments is the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place.\n\n“It’s uncertain,” the President said in January when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” he added.\n\nImpact on US soybeans\n\nUS exports of soybeans declined sharply immediately after China put the tariffs in place in 2018. Soybeans lost more than 75% of their export value to China between 2018 and 2019, according to a report from the USDA.\n\nBut soybean sales to China have nearly rebounded to their pre-trade-war levels. Soybean exports to China were just 1% lower in the year after the Phase One deal had been signed than they were in 2017, the USDA report found.\n\nStill, it’s hard to know what would have happened without the tariffs in place.\n\n“The overall impact the tariffs have had on trade is a much harder thing to sort through ever since the ceasefire,” said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and former chief economist at the USDA.\n\nStill, he thinks it’s a “no-brainer” for the US to lift the tariffs. “It would help normalize trade,” Glauber added.\n\nSome farmers fear they may have permanently lost some of their Chinese buyers who turned to other countries for soybeans over the last four years.\n\nAs US exports to China increased after the Phase One agreement was reached, exports from other countries grew at even faster. As a result, the US market share of China’s agricultural imports is now smaller than it was before the trade war: 17% in approximately the first year of Phase One compared with 20% in calendar year 2017, according to the USDA.\n\nThere are non-tariff barriers to trade imposed by China as well. Commercial Chinese buyers need government approval to import US soybeans.\n\n“Importers in China have to jump through hoops to get access to US soybeans. There’s clearly a cost to doing business,” Glauber said.\n\nBut trade issues have taken a back seat to other more pressing worries for farmers, according to the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer. In April, 42% of producers said higher input costs are their top concern.\n\nWhile Walton remains frustrated with the Biden administration’s lack of action on trade, he also said he is worried about rising costs, especially for herbicide.\n\n“I’ve seen some instances where the price of herbicide has doubled or tripled. … We didn’t get our first choice, but we finally got an herbicide we can use to protect our crop,” Walton said.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/record-gas-prices-wont-be-solved-by-drilling-more-oil-climate/index.html", "title": "Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more US oil ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs US oil and gasoline prices skyrocket, politicians in both parties have called for a seemingly easy solution: Drill our way out of the problem to ease prices at the pump and supply additional energy to Europe.\n\n“The president must end his war on American energy,” Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said in a recent statement. “Republicans have been demanding the administration take the shackles off American energy producers since President Biden took office. We have the energy at home and we must use it.”\n\nBut the US is already the world’s top producer of crude oil, producing about 11.6 million barrels of oil per day as of December – and that supply is increasing, energy experts told CNN. The country is also the world’s largest consumer of oil, using about 21 million barrels per day in 2019 – 20% of the world’s total.\n\nBuried under US soil lies an estimated 38.2 billion barrels worth of proven oil reserves that are still untapped, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But there’s a big impediment to the US using that oil: It tends to be lighter and different from the heavier imported oil we currently rely on.\n\nThe idea that the US can be fully energy independent – and that it would combat rising gas prices – is a fantasy, numerous experts told CNN.\n\n“What Americans and US officials really care about is the price of gasoline, and that has almost nothing to do about whether we’re energy independent or not,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. “Can the US wall itself off from volatility in the global oil market? The answer is no.”\n\nIt’s too early to tell whether the current price shock will spur a change in how Americans consume oil, but experts said it’s forcing a hard look at how the country uses it.\n\n“The issue the US is grappling with from a security standpoint – we’re dependent on oil,” Sam Ori, executive director of the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute, told CNN. “The idea that if we produce more oil in some way it would help with that problem – it’s just not true.”\n\nWhy more drilling won’t curb gas prices\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but the biggest one is that oil is truly a global commodity, experts told CNN. The global price of oil determines gas prices in the US, and it’s impossible to divorce that price from the shifting global dynamics.\n\n“Energy markets are global, the oil market even more so than natural gas,” said energy analyst Rachel Ziemba. “It’s not really realistic, in my mind, to close [the US] off and be energy independent and say, ‘Sorry, guys, we’re independent and we don’t care about you.’ ”\n\nThe US gets the vast majority of its imported crude oil from Canada (4 million barrels per day), Mexico (492,000 barrels per day) and Middle East oil giants like Saudi Arabia and Iraq (a combined 695,000 barrels per day). Organizations like OPEC+ have a huge influence on prices, which fluctuate due to production targets. Oil prices were already rising before Russia’s war in Ukraine, because Saudi Arabia and Russia were producing less fuel than they promised, CNN reported.\n\n“Everybody pays the same price for crude oil,” said McNally.\n\nThere’s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces. McNally likened the kind of light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee.\n\nImportantly, US oil refineries are built to refine this “heavy and gunky” imported crude – akin to separating out coffee grounds, McNally said.\n\n“Even setting aside the complexities related to crude qualities and refinery diets/configurations and the role of biofuels, the US still needs to import oil as domestic supplies still sit below its gigantic oil demand, despite growing tremendously in the past 10 years,” Claudio Galimberti, an oil markets expert and senior vice president of analysis at Rystad Energy, told CNN via email.\n\nOil pumpjacks in the Inglewood Oil Field in Los Angeles, California. The oil the US produces is not the same kind that it is set up to refine. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nNatural gas presents a different picture; unlike Europe, which is largely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supply, the US produces nearly all of its natural gas at home. In fact, one of the short-term fixes to help Europe detach from Russian gas is increasing liquid natural gas shipments to Europe from the US.\n\nBut McNally said the concept of “energy independence” doesn’t matter for most Americans; what matters are the prices at the pump.\n\nThere are also stark climate change implications to new drilling: Last year, the International Energy Agency said no new oil and gas projects should be approved if we intend to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees – a critical threshold that scientists warn the planet should stay under.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Democrats in Congress and climate advocacy groups have also called for the US to boost the domestic production of renewable energy like wind and solar and to shift the auto industry and consumers toward electric vehicles.\n\nIf most consumers were driving electric vehicles, gas-price shocks wouldn’t hit so hard.\n\n“Even if we supplied our entire oil and gas needs today domestically, we’d never have full control over the price because Putin’s actions factor into the price,” Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told CNN. Heinrich said cleaner technologies like electric heat pumps and electric vehicles “sever that influence.”\n\nBiden’s oil and gas permitting at pace with Trump’s\n\nRepublican lawmakers in particular have blasted the Biden administration for what they have characterized as an energy agenda that prioritizes climate and clean energy action over fossil fuel drilling.\n\n“This is about replacing Russian oil with American and North American resources that this administration has stifled – let’s face it – in its executive order on public lands, its decision to stop Keystone,” Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said recently. “There are things we can do to get our production back up to where it was.”\n\nThe Biden administration has indeed put more of an emphasis on developing renewable energy. Its offshore wind development goal, for example, is far beyond what the Obama administration had set out to achieve. But even with its clean energy priorities, the Biden administration’s oil and gas permitting numbers have so far kept pace with the early years of the Trump administration.\n\nThe Biden administration approved 3,537 permits to drill in its first year, more than the number issued by the Trump administration in each of its first three years, according to a CNN analysis of Bureau of Land Management drilling permit data. The Trump administration approved 2,658 permits in 2017, 3,332 in 2018 and 3,415 in 2019 before accelerating the number of approvals to 5,367 in 2020.\n\nBiden paused new oil and gas leasing at the start of his administration, but that pause is long gone after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked it. And the most recent delay in oil and gas permitting is the result of a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nNow the administration is caught between its short-term goal of easing gas prices and its long-term goal of installing more clean energy and vehicles and cutting carbon emissions.\n\n“I think what they’re trying to do now is to recognize that there is a near-term goal of reducing global reliance on Russian energy,” Ziemba said. “That both means finding additional supplies of oil and gas from other jurisdictions, including at home, just as it means conservation and consumption changes and additional deployment of cleaner energy.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/20/coronavirus-congress-negotiate-mitch-mcconnells-stimulus-plan/2882626001/", "title": "Coronavirus: Stimulus talks to continue Saturday in Senate", "text": "WASHINGTON – Senators working on a stimulus package to help Americans impacted by the coronavirus did not come to an agreement Friday night and will reconvene Saturday morning.\n\nLawmakers hope to come to a bipartisan compromise that could offer $1,200 checks to Americans and help for smaller businesses and airlines.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set a Saturday afternoon deadline for legislative text, according to Capitol Hill reporters.\n\nWhile those in Washington acknowledged that the nation has been divided, lawmakers have largely expressed a sense of optimism about working together to counter the coronavirus crisis.\n\nHowever, in a letter sent Friday afternoon to her Democratic colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the cash assistance plan rolled out by McConnell.\n\n“As you know, Senator McConnell has released his proposal for a third coronavirus response package, which is not at all pro-worker and puts corporations ahead of working people,” Pelosi wrote in her letter. “As written, it is a non-starter.”\n\nThere has also been mixed reviews on offering cash assistance to Americans.

The latest move would potentially allow that money to be used in additional ways, New York officials said, including for unemployment assistance, temporary shelter assistance and food programs.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has had a touch-and-go relationship with the White House during his state's response to the virus, banned all nonessential travel Friday, mandating everyone not critical to their workplace to stay at home and requiring all businesses to shutter if they do not fit specific criteria.\n\nCuomo announced the sweeping escalation of restrictions as the novel coronavirus spread through the state, with New York having the highest number of confirmed cases in the nation.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, applauded the move.\n\n“We’re at a vital point in the battle against the disease,” Schumer said, “and we need to do everything in our power to stop it, right here, right now.\n\n– John Fritze and Joseph Spector\n\nNancy Pelosi says Mitch McConnell’s stimulus plan is a ‘non-starter’\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues Friday evening criticizing the cash assistance plan rolled out by Republicans, after a day of negotiations.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan includes payments of up to $1,200 to individuals, with married couples eligible for up to $2,400 in assistance and an additional $500 for every child. It would also lend to distressed industries like airlines.\n\n“As you know, Senator McConnell has released his proposal for a third coronavirus response package, which is not at all pro-worker and puts corporations ahead of working people,” Pelosi wrote in her letter. “As written, it is a non-starter.”\n\nThe California Democrat wrote that the coronavirus response should focus on supporting health care workers and strengthen the safety net amid the pandemic crisis.\n\n“Any response package must greatly increase Unemployment Insurance and Medicaid, help small businesses survive, expand paid sick and family leave and put money directly into the hands of those who need it most,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe issue of paid sick and family leave has been contentious, with Democrats arguing it would ensure workers can stay home without the worries they won’t be able to pay their bills and Republicans worried about the impact on small businesses.\n\n– Jeanine Santucci\n\nAG Barr urges public to report suspected coronavirus fraud schemes\n\nAttorney General William Barr urged the public to report suspected coronanvirus-related fraudulent schemes by calling the National Center for Disaster Fraud.\n\nIn a memorandum on Friday, Barr said examples of such schemes could include:\n\nIndividuals and businesses selling fake cures for coronavirus online.\n\nPhishing emails posing as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCD).\n\nFraudulently seeking donations for fake charitable organizations.\n\nFriday’s memo comes after Barr directed all U.S. attorneys this week to prioritize investigations of hackers and fraudsters that were exploiting the pandemic.\n\nBarr wrote then that, \"The pandemic is dangerous enough without wrongdoers seeking to profit from public panic and this sort of conduct cannot be tolerated.\"\n\n--Savannah Behrmann\n\nPence staffer tests positive for coronavirus\n\nWASHINGTON – A member of Vice President Mike Pence’s staff has tested positive for coronavirus, the White House said Friday, marking the first such infection within the top rungs of the administration.\n\nKatie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, did not identify the staffer, nor did she say specifically where the individual worked. Pence is leading the administration’s coronavirus task force and has been a regular presence at the president’s side in recent weeks.\n\n“This evening we were notified that a member of the Office of the Vice President tested positive for the Coronavirus,” Miller said in statement. “Neither President Trump nor Vice President Pence had close contact with the individual.”\n\nMiller said contact tracing was being conducted in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pence said Monday that he had not been tested for the virus. Trump was tested and said his test was negative.\n\nThe vice president's office did not immediately respond to questions about where the staff member worked or whether Pence had been tested sometime this week.\n\n\"I have not been tested yet,\" Pence said Monday. \"I’m in regular consultation with the White House physician, and he said I’ve not been exposed to anyone for any period of time that had the coronavirus, and that my wife and I have no symptoms.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump properties cut staff\n\nPresident Donald Trump's family hotel business is cutting back on staff at some properties because of the impact from the coronavirus outbreak, according to media reports.\n\nAdditionally, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida was closed Friday after Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered all bars and restaurants in the state to close.\n\nThe Trump Organization has laid off staff at hotels in New York, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C.\n\nKimberly Benza, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said, \"Various facilities are temporarily closed given local, state and federal mandates.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago closed after the press secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for COVID-19 after visiting the property earlier in this month.\n\nAs of Friday night, Trump’s Washington hotel remains open, despite a directive from the D.C. government that forces bars and restaurants to close.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nTrump: GM moving toward making ventilators, but questions remain\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that General Motors was moving toward refitting plants to make breathing ventilators, though it remained unclear if it was feasible for the automaker to do so.\n\nEarlier in the week, GM confirmed it had talked to Trump administration officials about possibly using its production capacity to produce medical equipment in short supply.\n\nBut on Friday, Trump appeared to take the prospect of that happening even further, telling a reporter who asked if automakers were refitting plants to make ventilators, \"I can't say they are but they will be.\"\n\nJim Cain, a spokesman for GM, did not confirm or deny Trump's statement.\n\n\"Discussions and studies are taking place on how GM could support production of medical equipment like ventilators. We will provide additional information as it becomes available,\" he said.\n\n– Todd Spangler and Jamie L. LaReau, Detroit Free Press\n\nBloomberg campaign laid off staffers who may have been at risk of COVID-19 exposure\n\nBillionaire Michael Bloomberg notified workers Thursday night from his New York headquarters that they may have been exposed to the coronavirus, and asked them to work from home, according to POLITICO.\n\nThen, the campaign laid-off hundreds of workers, including some of those from New York, meaning that they will lose health insurance at the end of March, in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nBloomberg, who ended his campaign at the beginning of March, had originally told staffers they would be paid until November, even if he wasn't the candidate. However, after he ended the campaign, he signaled to staffers they would only be paid until March 31, but could work on a super PAC he set out to build to boost the Democratic nominee in critical swing states in November.\n\nOn Friday, Bloomberg announced he was abandoning those plans, and would rather pair with the DNC.\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nMcConnell sets clock on coronavirus bill that could offer cash to Americans\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed cloture on a third coronavirus package, setting up the possibility of a vote Monday on the bill that aims to offer cash to Americans and help to both small businesses and airlines.\n\nThe move comes as senators continue to negotiate the details of the measure, with lawmakers huddling in groups to hammer out key details that will need to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe bill has not been finalized and is still being altered and drafted by staff as senators continue negotiations. McConnell has set a goal of reaching a deal by the end of Friday and passing the bill by Monday.\n\nThe procedural move means the Senate could vote on Sunday to start debate on the bill before voting on the legislation on Monday.\n\nIf approved, the legislation would be sent to the House then to President Trump for his signature.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nTrump: Department of Education won't enforce standardized testing\n\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court will issues opinions Monday – but without taking the bench.\n\nThe justices met for their regular private conference Friday – but several of them joined by phone.\n\nAnd in the most poignant sign of the times: They did not shake hands, a venerable tradition.\n\nThose were among the updates issued Friday by court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg following the justices' regularly scheduled conference, held during highly irregular times.\n\n“All of the justices are healthy,” Arberg said in a statement issued by the court. “Like all of us, the justices are following public health guidance. The justices are temporarily foregoing their traditional handshake.”\n\nWhile their work continues in private, the justices won’t sit in session Monday to issue opinions, and hard copies won’t be distributed. That will mark a first since the court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election with its ruling in Bush v. Gore.\n\n- Richard Wolf\n\nTrump on complaints about tests: 'I'm not hearing it'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he's not hearing concerns about Americans not being able to get coronavirus tests.\n\n\"I'm not hearing it,\" Trump told reporters when pressed on complaints from Americans who can't get a test.\n\nBut one of Trump's top health aides – Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – said he has heard stories of testing problems. But he argued that things are getting better.\n\n“I get the same calls that many of you get,\" Fauci told reporters. \"That someone goes into a place who has a system and wants a test and for one reason or other ... they can’t get it.\"\n\nHe added: \"That is a reality that’s happening now. Is it the same as a few weeks ago? Absolutely not.”\n\nTrump also said \"we don’t want everybody to go out and get a test, because there’s no reason for it\" if you aren't sick.\n\nFauci basically agreed with him, saying \"universal testing\" should not be the issue.\n\nTests only determine who has coronavirus, and people shouldn't take them unless they are exhibiting symptoms. Fauci said the emphasis should be on stopping the spread of coronavrius and treating those who contract it.\n\n\"Let's not conflate testing with the action we have to take,\" Fauci said.\n\n- David Jackson and John Fritze\n\nTrump on experimental drugs: 'What the hell do you have to lose?'\n\nBlowing off criticism he is hyping the potential benefits of experimental drugs on coronavirus, President Donald Trump on Friday repeated a question he used to ask voters during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"What the hell do you have to lose?\" Trump said during an argument with a reporter over the president's habit of overstating actions to fight the virus.\n\nOn Monday, Trump touted two drugs he said show \"really good promise\" to fight coronavirus and are soon available for \"delivery\" – the Food and Drug Administration later had to clarify that the drugs have not been approved, though testing of them is being expedited.\n\nTrump said \"good things\" are happening on the drug front.\n\n\"Let's see what happens; we have nothing to lose,\" Trump said. \"You know the expression – what the hell do you have to lose?'\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTrump asked to address fearful Americans\n\nPresident Donald Trump lashed out at an NBC reporter who asked him what he would say to people who are afraid with the outbreak of coronavirus\n\n“I say that you’re a terrible reporter,” said Trump, who accused the reporter Peter Alexander of sensationalism. “You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\nTrump used the opportunity to make a dig at the media in general, saying he sees false news stories. However, he didn't mention a specific report.\n\nPressed by another reporter on his message to people who are frightened, Trump stressed there are “very low incidences of death” from the virus.\n\n“My message to the American people is … you’ve done an incredible job. There is tremendous hope. I think we’re going to come out stronger, bigger and better.\"\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nTrump: national lockdown not 'necessary'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he doesn’t see the need for a national lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"I don’t think we’ll ever find that necessary,\" he said.\n\nState and local governments are putting in place more strict measures - like shelter-in-place orders - to restrict the the virus' spread.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nPence: Congress may act early next week on stimulus\n\nVice President Mike Pence said Congress may act early next week on a package to reinvigorate the economy amid the stock market downfall resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a plan Thursday that includes cash assistance for individual Americans and businesses. McConnell said Friday he hopes Democratic and Republican senators can come to a deal by midnight so he can set up a vote on Monday.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nCDC suspending entry of people entering US illegally from Mexico and Canada\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is suspending the entry of certain people into the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced.\n\nThe suspension applies to people coming from Mexico and Canada who are seeking to enter the U.S. illegally and would normally be held in a border station.\n\n“We’re talking about significant numbers of illegal immigrants,” Azar said.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nUS-Mexico border closed to non-essential travel\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that \"the U.S. and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our state border\" to stop the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"As we did with Canada, we're also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend nonessential travel,\" President Donald Trump said. \"These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.\" Trump also said that Mexico is also suspending air travel from Europe.\n\nThe expected announcement follows the closure of the border between the U.S. and Canada to nonessential travel, which was announced Wednesday. Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters the closure would happen at midnight Friday.\n\nPompeo also warned Americans who travel abroad that their travel plans may be interrupted.\n\nPompeo said the government is prepared to “use all of the tools we can” to help U.S. citizens stranded in other countries get back to the U.S. Those efforts involve commercial and private flights, he said, and when space is available on military planes, “we will bring them back on those flights.”\n\n“It’s a full government effort,” he said.\n\n- John Fritze, Michael Collins and David Oliver\n\nTrump says he put Defense Production Act 'into gear,' but sends mixed signals\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he put the Defense Production Act \"into gear\" but did not specify how and repeatedly sent mixed signals about what steps his administration has taken.\n\nTrump signed an executive order this week invoking the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, allowing the federal government broad authority to instruct private businesses to help meet the needs of national defense. But the president has so far chosen not to use the powers to demand additional equipment.\n\nThat reticence has come as governors and local officials say they need a significant influx of medical supplies to fight the coronavirus, especially ventilators and protective masks for first responders.\n\nBut Trump was unclear Friday about whether he had directed companies to make more masks and protective gear. At first he indicated that he had, and then said he hasn't had to because they have come forward on their own to voluntarily produce the equipment.\n\n“So far we have not had to,” he said. “It is an amazing thing that has happened. We are being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work. They want to help our country with that.”\n\nAsked again a few minutes later whether he had ordered companies to produce supplies under the act, Trump said, \"I have.\" Asked how many and which supplies, specifically, Trump said: \"A lot.\"\n\nHe said he didn't want to name the companies but then said he asked General Motors to produce equipment for the government. The automaker was reportedly exploring converting its manufacturing plants to produce ventilators.\n\n- John Fritze and Michael Collins\n\nTrump: Standard testing won't be enforced for students\n\nPresident Donald Trump said that the Department of Education would no longer enforce standardized testing requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year.\n\n\"We're not going to be enforcing that,\" Trump said. \"I think a lot of the students are probably going to be very happy,\" but acknowledged that some of them would not.\n\nTrump also said he spoke with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying “Democrats are very much wanting something to happen” on an economic stimulus. He said he also spoke at length with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nHere's what else was said at the news briefing:\n\nTrump addressed the decision to move back Tax Day to July: \"We’re moving it out to July 15 so that people will have time. Hopefully by that time people will be getting back to their lives.\"\n\nTrump praised the governors of California and New York for imposing more strict lockdowns in their states in the past day. \"I applaud them,\" he said. \"They’re taking very strong, bold steps.\"\n\nTrump said the U.S. has learned a lot about relying on other countries during the coronavirus pandemic: “Some good things came out of it,” he said. Some were not so good, he added.\n\n- John Fritze and Michael Collins\n\nTrump tells Schumer he will use Defense Production Act to boost ventilator supply\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer talked this morning about coronavirus and the struggling supply of ventilators, the life-saving devices crucial to treating the respiratory effects of COVID-19.\n\nWhen the New York Democrat urged the president to invoke the Defense Production Act to help get ventilators, the president yelled to someone in his office to \"do it now,\" according to a readout of the call from Schumer's office.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump did invoke the Defense Production Act but only vowed to use it if necessary. The measure allows the federal government broad authority to instruct private businesses to help meet the needs of national defense. In the case of coronavirus, that means the production of ventilators and protective masks for first responders.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nIndiana moves back primary election\n\nIndiana's primary election will move from May 5 to June 2, according to state and party officials.\n\nAll dates corresponding with the primary election will be moved by 28 days to reflect the new date of the primary. For example, military and overseas ballots are required to mailed 45 days prior to the primary election, so they’ll move 45 days prior to June 2.\n\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb made the announcement Friday along with state Secretary of State Connie Lawson, state Republican Party Chair Kyle Hupfer and state Democratic Party Chair John Zody.\n\n- The Indianapolis Star\n\nIvanka Trump tests negative for coronavirus\n\nIvanka Trump has tested negative for coronavirus and is back at work at the White House, officials said Friday.\n\nThe president's daughter and advisor began staying home after a senior Australian government official announced he was infected with the virus, just a week after posing for pictures with her and other government officials during a visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the past week, Ivanka Trump \"has followed social distancing best practices at her home,\" a White House statement said. \"At the advisement of her doctors, due to lack of symptoms and consistently healthy physician checks, Advisor Trump will be working from the White House today.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nMcConnell aiming for stimulus deal by midnight\n\nMore than two dozen senators from both parties gathered Friday morning to nailing down a deal on a massive emergency stimulus package to help workers and businesses impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters he aimed for leaders in both parties to come to a deal in principle by midnight, allowing him to start the procedural mechanisms that could tee up a vote on the roughly $1 trillion package on Monday.\n\nHe said the meeting allowed the large pool of senators to break up into four groups to discuss various aspects of the legislation McConnell introduced Thursday. The bill includes direct payments of $1,200 to individuals and assistance to businesses to deal with the health and economic harm from the pandemic.\n\n\"I task these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today,\" McConnell told reporters outside the meeting. \"The Secretary of the Treasury has indicated it's important for us to be on the Senate floor and to pass the measure on Monday.\"\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nDemocrats have objections to McConnell's plan\n\nThe meeting does not include members of the Democratic-led House, who will also have to approve the measure before it can go to President Donald Trump for approval.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday McConnell's proposal doesn't do enough for workers.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., told reporters outside the meeting that he and other senators \"need to work together to get something big and bold that helps the American people.\" But, he added, there are issues with the proposal offered by McConnell.\n\nSchumer noted the need for additional paid sick and family leave and bolstered unemployment insurance for workers being laid off. He also highlighted additional help for hospitals and Democrats' issues with offering money to airlines and other big industries impacted.\n\n\"We are not going to go for any bailouts unless they are worker-friendly. The money goes to workers, employees, and no stock buybacks—none of that is in [Sen. McConnell’s] bill,\" Schumer said. \"We're going to fight hard to get them in the bill, and get it done.\"\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nPentagon: coronavirus cases in the military surge to 124\n\nCases of coronavirus in the military surged to 124 on Friday, the Pentagon reported. The total from Thursday was 81.\n\nAt 5 a.m., there were 67 troops with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, an increase of 16 from Thursday. There were also 26 family members and 31 civilian employees and dependents with the virus.\n\nThree service members and one contractor have recovered.\n\nMeanwhile, the staff for the military’s two, 1,000-bed hospital ships began reporting for duty today. The ships, however, will not be ready to sail for some time. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Fox & Friends that the USS Comfort would not be ready to deploy to New York until April. The USS Mercy, on the West Coast, will be ready sooner.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMcConnell's $1,200 cash assistance plan leaves out workers, Dems say\n\nNegotiations in Congress continue over a massive stimulus package to blunt the economic effects of the coronavirus as Democrats expressed opposition to a plan rolled out by Republicans Thursday that would provide direct cash payments to Americans.\n\nMcConnell's plan includes direct payments of $1,200 to individuals. Married couples would be eligible for up to $2,400 in assistance with an additional $500 for every child. The Kentucky Republican's pitch would also lend to distressed industries like airlines.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they were reviewing the proposal but \"on first reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers.\"\n\nDemocrats have expressed opposition to the lending to airlines and other industries, saying such an action benefits business' bottom lines rather than helping employees.\n\n\"One of the reasons industries are so short on cash right now is that they have spent billions buying back their own stocks instead of investing in their workers and saving for a rainy day,\" Schumer wrote on Twitter Thursday evening. \"That needs to be addressed NOW.\"\n\nThey also object to being shut out of the original drafting process. McConnell divided up Republican senators into three task forces that devised different parts of the proposed legislation.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Thursday night, McConnell said it was a decision made in favor of speed.\n\n\"This is the quickest way to get it done. Trust me, this is the quickest way to get it done, exactly the way we're doing it,\" he said.\n\nCalls for resignations for senators who sold stock after coronavirus briefings\n\nFigures on both sides of the aisle called for senators who sold stock before coronavirus sent the market into a plunge to resign. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., an outspoken progressive voice, called the sales \"stomach-churning\" and called for Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. to resign.\n\nAnd Fox News host Tucker Carlson slammed Burr on his program, calling on him to explain his actions \"immediately\" or else he should resign and wait for prosecution for insider trading.\n\n\"There is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis, and that appears to be what happened,\" Carlson said.\n\nBoth Loeffler and Burr have denied the accusations. Sens.

Most U.S. plants have cut production and workers.\n\nGrassley said the administration had a 13-point package for helping the ethanol industry, but he declined to say what was in it or what he and other ag-state leaders proposed.\n\nBloomberg reported Friday that a plan was developed to replace gallons lost to EPA waivers using a three-year rolling average, beginning in 2020, through the RFS.\n\nThe industry hopes at least 1 billion gallons of ethanol are replaced annually.\n\nBut Trump and administration officials are expected to meet with congressional leaders representing oil-producing states this week.\n\n\"If it comes out on paper the way that the White House seemed to agree with us, then I would say we have a win-win situation,\" Grassley said.\n\nEPA \"can waive all the small refinery waivers\" it wants, \"just make sure we get 15 billion gallons,\" Grassley said, as outlined for corn-based ethanol under the federal mandate.\n\nThe waivers have sparked a rebellion in farm country, which has mostly backed the president during trade wars with China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nSome biofuels and farm leaders have said they've felt betrayed by the president, who has repeatedly told farmers he supports them and renewable fuels.\n\nGrassley said Trump was shocked at how farmers and biofuels producers reacted to his administration's recent 31 ethanol exemptions. The waivers traditionally are provided to small oil refineries experiencing financial hardship, but they've been granted to oil giants such as ExxonMobil and Chevron Corp.\n\n\"He didn't realize the impact,\" Grassley said of Trump, and the president asked Iowa leaders to find a solution to the waivers that would address corn, soybean, ethanol and biodiesel leaders' concerns.\n\n\"That's what was presented (to) the president,\" Grassley said of last week's meeting, which included U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, Gov.

Almost all gasoline sold in the U.S. contains 10% ethanol.\n\n\"He felt he couldn't satisfy both Big Oil and farmers.

But since he was elected, Trump has toyed with country-specific tariffs as a negotiating tactic or punitive measure.\n\nTrump has talked about using tariffs as a way to offset some of the revenue that would be lost by extending and expanding his 2017 tax cuts. He added tariffs on pharmaceuticals, computer chips and metals such as copper, steel and aluminum to his list on Monday, which he said could help pay for another tax cut for domestic manufacturers and bring industrial jobs back to the United States.\n\nBut he also has threatened to impose tariffs as a form of punishment for countries he views as uncooperative − which means forgoing the duties if they do concede to his demands. That includes tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada, unless they clamp down on fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration.\n\n\"We're going to protect our country with tariffs,” Trump told Republican lawmakers in a speech. “If they don’t make their product in America, then very simply, they should have to pay a tariff, which will bring in trillions of dollars into our treasury,” he added, referring to foreign manufacturers.\n\nTrump allies say he may ultimately go with some combination of the ideas he’s floating or a tariff strategy that wraps in all of the above.\n\n“Punish our enemies, use tariffs as a bargaining chip and use tariffs as a revenue-raising measure to offset the reduction in the income taxes that we want to do,” said Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser for Trump's campaign and a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, of the thinking inside the White House.\n\nMore:Tariffs, inflation, and retailers: How Trump's potential tariffs could hit your wallet\n\nSome experts say that approach could cause problems down the line. Tariffs that countries can wriggle out of through policy concessions are not a stable revenue source, and what if other nations follow through on threats to introduce retaliatory tariffs?\n\nTariffs that are primarily used as a negotiating tool to drive national security policy, “can be immensely effective,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n“But if that's how they're used, it will undermine their positive effects on fiscal policy, because it is never clear how long they will be in place,” MacGuineas said. “If you want to offset permanent tax cuts, there'd have to be a commitment that the tariffs will be permanent, and that seems highly unlikely.”\n\nThe president could wind up with less revenue than he’s expecting and send costs soaring for Americans, experts and economists say. Even the threat of tariffs can create uncertainty in the markets, slow trade and damage America’s relationships with its allies.\n\n\"Our experiments with tariffs over the last decade have not gone great,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics at the right-leaning CATO Institute.\n\nA focus on reducing trade deficits\n\nTrump has cited trade deficits and other spending imbalances for pursuing sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. had a trade deficit of $773.4 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Annual data for 2024 has not been released yet.\n\nIts largest deficits were with China, at $279.4 billion, the European Union, at $208.2 billion and Mexico at $152.4 billion. Another target of Trump’s complaints, Canada, had a trade deficit of $67.9 billion.\n\n“China's an abuser, but the European Union is very, very bad to us,” Trump told reporters last week. “Essentially, everybody treats us badly,” he added.\n\nHe said in remarks to the World Economic Forum later in the week that the trade deficit with Europe is immense, \"And we’re going to do something about it.\"\n\nHis first evening on office, Trump ordered his administration to investigate the \"causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, as well as the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and recommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits.\"\n\nYet, it is taking Trump and his nascent economic team longer than he suggested to sort it out. He said as president-elect that he'd put tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he is considering tariffs of 25% for Canada and Mexico and a hike of 10% for China. Those actions could be announced as soon as Feb. 1.\n\nUsing tariff threats as a diplomatic weapon\n\nTrump said on the campaign trail that he’d put blanket tariffs of 10-20% on every nation, before shifting to a strategy during the transition of threatening them against individual countries who dared to cross him.\n\nTrump moved over the weekend to immediately put tariffs on Colombia after the Latin American country refused to accept migrant repatriation flights. He revoked the order after the Colombian government agreed to his terms.\n\nPeter Navarro, the senior counselor at the White House for trade and manufacturing, said in a Fox Business interview on Monday that other countries would “think twice” as a result about refusing American planes.\n\n“This particular incident sends a signal to every other country that the president is not messing around when he says we’re deporting your exports,” Navarro said.\n\nTrump seemed to open up a new front in his tariff agenda Monday evening as he spoke to House Republican lawmakers in Florida. He said during a speech he could put duties on specific products.\n\nTrump previewed tariffs on computer chips, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in the “very near” future to redirect business investment into the United States.\n\nHe said he’d also be placing tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, and other items that are needed to support the U.S. military. “We have to bring production back to our country,” Trump said.\n\nIn an extensive riff on the subject, he said companies that make their products in America should have their taxes reduced to 15% from the 21% that his first administration and a Republican Congress adopted.\n\nAs for the universal tariffs, Trump told reporters Monday evening on Air Force One that he was currently looking at a number that was much higher than a 2.5% baseline and gradual increase that his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly put forward.\n\nEven before the recent shifts in Trump's proposals, Lincicome, of the CATO Institute, said \"there's a lot of incoherence\" to what Trump was putting forward.\n\n\"You can't have a stable revenue raiser or a stable industry protector if you're applying and removing tariffs constantly because of negotiations,\" he said.\n\nTrump allies say there are multiple reasons to use tariffs, and maximizing leverage and raising revenue are not mutually exclusive.\n\nA century ago, the primary way the federal government made its money was through tariffs, former Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien argued. “So there's a lot of revenue to be had there for the federal government.”\n\n“I think the tariffs will also incentivize American companies to come home, and partner countries that have great corporations like South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland, and other big countries that have well-developed economies and big companies that make a lot of money selling into America, to move their manufacturing of those products that they sell here to the United States,\" O’Brien said.\n\nHe predicted Trump would implement a universal tariff, from which he could exempt certain countries who do what he’s asking them to before or after the deadline.\n\n“If you do a blanket, then every country’s going to be knocking on your door to try to figure out how to get out from under the blanket. So the leverage is still there,” he said. “I don’t think it diminishes your leverage.”\n\nTariff proposals draw dissent from all corners\n\nTrump put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in his first term. He also went after imported washing machines and solar panels. He targeted China for tariffs in particular. Beijing responded by putting duties on the United States. So did India.\n\nInitially, he left Canada, Mexico and the European Union off his steel and aluminum tariff list before adding them later that same year. The dispute with Canada and Mexico was eventually solved by the ratification of a three-way trade agreement and after a long back-and-forth.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs were put into place by the EU and then paused under an agreement with the Biden administration. The suspension lasts through the end of March.\n\n“Are you sure that everybody will just go on and kind of continue without reacting? And as we saw from the previous time, countries, and EU as well, stood their ground,” EU Ambassador Jovita Neliupšienė said in an interview, referring to what happened after Trump introduced tariffs in his first term. “We really have our own trade defense instruments, and we used (them) last time.”\n\nCanada, China and Mexico have also signaled they would respond to tariffs with trade actions of their own.\n\nIf the idea is to balance trade, Neliupšienė told USA TODAY, there are measures Europe can discuss with the Trump administration. “And we are ready for that.”\n\n“If, you know, the question is about revenues and closing the budget gaps, it will not necessarily be as effective as people believe,” she said. “It actually can be really quite counterproductive, as it was last time, because a lot of goods were targeted, and (the) federal government had to step in and compensate some losses for some sectors.”\n\nShe suggested that higher imports by Europe of liquefied natural gas from the United States could be an area of discussion.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in the U.S. have accused Trump of effectively pursuing a national sales tax that will increase the cost of living.\n\n“These sweeping tariffs would raise prices, threaten jobs and harm our economy,\" Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told reporters during a January call, during which she introduced legislation that, if passed, would restrict Trump’s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs.\n\n\"Our allies and adversaries alike won’t take these tariffs lying down,\" DelBene said. \"They’ll retaliate against U.S. businesses and workers like they have in the past.”\n\nAfter Trump implemented tariffs in his first term, India closed its markets to American apples, which harmed farmers in her home state of Washington, she said. She warned that Canadians were already developing a list of items that they would target.\n\n“This is the textbook definition of a trade war,” DelBene said.\n\nTrump advisers have disputed claims that the proposed tariffs would spike prices, noting that inflation remained low during Trump's first term.\n\nBut even with Trump at the helm, not all types of tariffs are universally supported by Republicans.\n\nTexas Rep. Michael McCaul, a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview just before Trump returned to office, “If the tariffs are used as a sort of tool to effectuate better policy and behavior, then I'm all for them.”\n\nHowever, when it comes to putting duties on semiconductors, he said, Congress already incentivized production in the U.S. through the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe downside of putting across the board tariffs in place, McCaul added, is consumer prices could increase. “And I don't think the American people are going like that, when all of a sudden prices go up on everything.\"\n\nTrump has said he could tariff and sanction Russia to get the country to settle its war against Ukraine. Moore, an outside economic adviser to Trump, suggested new tariffs could also be on the way for Iran.\n\nYet, even Moore said he disagreed with protectionist-style tariffs on individual products like the ones on imported steel that Trump put into place in his first term. They didn't help much Moore, an economist said, because the price of steel went up.\n\n“I'm just not a big fan of those. I hope he doesn't go in that direction ... I'd much prefer a universal low-rate tariff,” Moore said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}]}

However, organic arsenic compounds, which are found in seafood, are less harmful.\n\nGreat Value Apple Juice sold at Walmart featured in 2 recall reports days apart\n\nIn the previous recall of the eight-ounce Great Value Apple Juice sold in a six-pack, Refresco Beverages US Inc. also listed inorganic arsenic as the reason for the recall.

The retailer told USA TODAY that it is planning to do the same for this recall as well.\n\n“The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,” Annie Patterson, a Walmart spokesperson said. “We have removed the products from our impacted stores and are working with the supplier to investigate.”\n\nSacconi said that \"at this time there are no reported incidents caused by these products.\"\n\nLatest apple juice recall is listed as not yet classified; FDA still assessing\n\nOn the FDA's website, all recalls are displayed in the Enforcement Report section where you can locate weekly recalls by month and year.\n\nEvery recall is posted on the Enforcement Report has a classification of Class I, II, III, pending or not yet classified.

But amid the clamor to watch as the moon passes in front of the sun and ushers in a dazzling sight across the continent, it may be easy to overlook some other celestial events that are also worthy of our admiration.\n\nCome Monday, the 115-mile-wide eclipse will move from southwest in Mexico to northeast in Canada. In the United States, 13 states fall on the path of totality, whereby the moon will completely block the sun's disc, leading to a period of darkness and revealing the sun's outermost layer known as the corona.\n\nWhen the eclipse has come and gone, a few other celestial events this month will give skygazers other reasons to look up. Here are three of them.\n\nSolar eclipse experiment:Here's why NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse\n\nApril 21: The 'devil comet'\n\nWhile the famed \"devil comet\" may be visible during the solar eclipse itself, astronomers say that the celestial body will be best sighted on April 21.\n\nThat's the day that the comet, officially known as 12P/Pons-Brooks, will make its closest approach to the sun in its 71-year orbit of the massive star.\n\nThe \"devil comet,\" which earned its demonic nickname from its distinctive tail that resembles horns, is typically visible to only those with the strongest of telescopes. But on the day it's closest to the sun, its brightness should increase so much that it will become visible to the naked eye.\n\nApril 21-22: Lyrids meteor shower\n\nThe Lyrids, one of the oldest-known meteor showers on record, has reliably peaked every year in late April like clockwork for thousands of years.\n\nThe shower, pieces of debris from the Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak. This year, that peak falls between April 21-22, according to EarthSky.org.\n\nThe first meteor shower of the spring, the fast and bright meteors of the Lyrids will appear to be flying across the night sky. While NASA notes that the Lyrids can surprise watchers with as many as 100 meteors seen per hour, in general, 10-20 Lyrid meteors can be seen per hour during the peak.\n\nApril 23: Pink moon\n\nThe pink moon, otherwise known as the first full moon of the spring, will rise April 23.\n\nNamed for the moss pink wildflower that sprouts this time of year, the moon won't appear as pink to our eyes here on Earth.\n\nBut that won't make it any less spectacular to witness.\n\nAs it rises just above the horizon, the pink moon will appear its biggest and take on a golden hue, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice; Wyatte Grantham-Philips\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

We'll see six planets in the first part of February – Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Venus and Saturn – and on Feb. 28, they'll be joined by Mercury.\n\nBut not all of them will be visible to the naked eye. You'll need high-powered binoculars or a telescope to see Neptune and Uranus. Saturn may be difficult to see since it will be near the sun, according to StarWalk.\n\nIt's not especially remarkable for a few planets to line up in the sky, but the sight of four or five brilliant planets at once is less common, according to NASA.\n\nHow does the alignment happen?\n\nThe planets orbit the sun continuously in the solar system, so at times, they slowly catch up to one another. Because they travel along the same path, or ecliptic, as they pass Earth, it appears they are aligned, according to NASA. The alignment formation, however, will be short-lived because each planet moves at different speeds.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

This year was one filled with astral displays that defied expectations and filled us here on Earth with a sense of wonder and awe about the universe that surrounds us.\n\nAnd thanks to the power of modern cell phones, that cosmic majesty is becoming easier to see and appreciate – even for those unable to witness the sights in person.\n\nHere's a recap of some of the most notable celestial events of the year, from the total solar eclipse to the proliferating northern lights.\n\nTotal solar eclipse dazzles millions across North America\n\nWhen you think about celestial events in 2024, no other cosmic display will come as close to defining the year as the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse, a once-in-a-lifetime event, completely put to shame its North American predecessor from 2017 when it charted a 115-mile-wide path across Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nWhy? The sun's outermost layer, the elusive corona, was brighter, the moon appeared larger and the uncharacteristic darkness known as totality lasted just a bit longer. What's more, millions of spectators in 13 states had a front row seat to witness the eclipse's majesty.\n\nFew celestial events have the ability to capture our collective attention. But for a few brief minutes when totality reached various cities across the U.S., schools let out, work came to a pause and people across the nation took a moment to take in the sight.\n\nThe awe-inspiring spectacle is a rarity – and will become even more so in the years ahead. While only seven years passed between total solar eclipses in North America, the next one visible in the continent won't be until 2044.\n\n'Devil Comet' makes itself visible to naked eye\n\nThe total solar eclipse is a tough act to follow, but later in the same month, the recognizable \"devil comet\" did its best.\n\nThe horned comet with a demonic nickname made itself visible in April to ground observers without telescopes.\n\nThe famed \"devil comet,\" officially known as 12P/Pons-Brooks, on April 21 made it closest approach to the sun in its 71-year orbit of the massive star.\n\nEarning its nickname from its distinctive tail that resembles horns, the comet has also been likened to the Millennium Falcon spaceship from \"Star Wars.\" While \"the Devil Comet\" is typically visible to only those with the strongest of telescopes, on the day it's closest to the sun, its brightness increased so much that astronomers predicted it would be visible to the naked eye.\n\nHarvest supermoon combines with partial lunar eclipse\n\nA spectacular lunar event dazzled skygazers Sept. 17 across the United States and the entire Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe Harvest Moon, which has inspired no shortage of cultural touchstones – from a Nintendo game to Neil Young’s Billboard hit – occurs annually around the start of fall at a time when Earth's only natural satellite is especially close to our planet. But this year's full Harvest Moon, which also just so happened to be an exceptionally large and bright supermoon, another phenomenon occurred: a partial lunar eclipse.\n\nOn that night, the orange-hued Harvest supermoon rose in the sky at a time when Earth's only natural satellite was unusually close to our planet on its elliptical orbit. Then, hours later, the moon was partly covered by Earth's shadow as our planet moved between it and the sun.\n\nStriking images from across the world captured the spectacular sight, including not only the Harvest supermoon, but also the moment when the partial lunar eclipse occurred.\n\nNorthern lights activity on rise amid solar maximum\n\nThe aurora borealis, a natural light display in Earth's sky famously best seen near our planet's poles, spent 2024 cropping up in a wider swath of the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe phenomenon, better known as the northern lights, surfaced with increased frequency amid the approach of the solar maximum.\n\nThat was most evident in May when a powerful geomagnetic storm unleashed spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible. On the downside, that solar storm was also responsible for some reports of power grid irregularities and interference with GPS signals – even farming equipment.\n\nThat particular storm watch was the first NOAA released in 19 years for a geomagnetic storm classified as a G4 – a single level away from being the most severe solar storm possible. Amid the solar activity, the sun even emitted an explosive burst of radiation that became the largest solar flare detected since 2017, according to the NOAA.\n\nThe auroras were also notably visible again in August during the Perseids, considered among astronomers to be the best meteor shower of the year.\n\nThen in October, Americans from the northern U.S. and even as far south as Alabama once again had a chance to witness the striking rays, spirals and flickers of the northern lights, which was amplified when a solar coronal mass ejection of plasma clouds and charged particles drove a geomagnetic storm toward Earth. The storm was so strong that it prompted NOAA to issue another rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch.\n\nNow that the sun is officially at the height of its 11-year cycle, the increase in solar activity will more frequently fuel \"space weather\" that produces the right conditions for northern lights to flourish.\n\nThat means, in the months ahead, the famed celestial display could be coming to a sky near you – if it hasn't already.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

With the next total eclipse happening Monday in many parts of the country, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I witnessed.\n\nThe path of totality crossed over Salem, Oregon, where I grew up and where my parents still live. So I made sure to plan a visit during that time.\n\nI figured it would be something special to see. And it was, putting it mildly.\n\nHaving grown up in the Pacific Northwest with natural beauty all around, I’ve always loved nature and enjoying the great outdoors. When camping as a kid, some of my favorite memories are getting up in the night and being dazzled by the tapestry of stars overhead.\n\nYet, the idea of space and the seemingly infinite number of planets and stars is unsettling. It makes one feel so insignificant and small.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhen events like an eclipse happen, they bring to the forefront how we’re just one planet hurtling through this never-ending void.\n\nSo I was expecting to feel something along those lines. I did, but I hadn’t anticipated just how breathtaking it would be.\n\nWhat's it like to watch a solar eclipse?\n\nOn a hot (thankfully clear!) summer morning, we watched the whole thing from my parents’ backyard. The colors around us changed as the moon covered more of the sun. It was like observing a sunset in fast motion.\n\nThat moment, though, when totality occurred (when the moon fully covers the sun) was simply beautiful, with the light of the sun’s corona dancing in the sky. I don’t think I took my eyes from it the entire 2 1/2 minutes.\n\nWhat happen if you look at the eclipse?Why the total solar eclipse is as eye-damaging as it is eye-catching.\n\nMy parents and husband saw it with me, and I recently asked them what the experience was like from their perspective.\n\n“It was a whole lot cooler than I thought it was going to be,” says my hard-to-impress husband. He remembers the stars coming out and then the birds beginning to sing as if it were dawn. “It was awesome.”\n\nMy dad recalls it as “wondrous” and “delightful,” especially because he got to see it from his own yard and didn't have to contend with the flocks of people who had descended on our state.\n\nMy mom had more mixed feelings. “It felt like we were being plunged into never-ending darkness,” she recalls. Once the sun began to emerge again, she felt better.\n\nWe all describe the eclipse as unforgettable.\n\nIt's a frog! It's a demon!Actually, it's a solar eclipse.\n\nA once-in-a-lifetime event for many\n\nPart of what makes a total solar eclipse so special is that it's rare. When such events happen over large swaths of the country – as was the case in 2017 and will be on Monday – it’s a bonding experience for millions of Americans.\n\nThe excitement and buildup ahead of this year’s eclipse and the fact so many of us will watch it at the same time is reminiscent of a celestial Super Bowl.\n\nIn 2017, NASA estimates, more than 200 million U.S. adults viewed the eclipse either in person or electronically.\n\nMonday’s eclipse has the potential to reach an even wider swath of the country because of where it will arc, starting in Texas and ending in Maine. And totality will last longer this time – up to more than four minutes.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, from 1924 to 2023, only 13 total solar eclipses crossed the contiguous United States or Alaska. In the next 100 years, just 11 will be visible.\n\nAfter Monday, the next total eclipse that will cross a wide swath of the United States does not occur until 2045.\n\nMy nieces and nephews will be in 'smack middle' of path of totality\n\nThis year, I will unfortunately not be in the path of totality. But my brother and his family in Texas will be. (I'm crossing my fingers Mother Nature cooperates for them to see it clearly.)\n\nI called my nieces and nephews this week to see what they think about getting to watch the eclipse. Monday will be their first total solar eclipse, although last fall they saw the annular eclipse, which is when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth but when it is at or near its farthest point from Earth.\n\nHere’s what the kids had to say:\n\nAvila, age 14: “I’ll be very excited to be able to see a full eclipse instead of a partial one. This will be particularly interesting to be able to see the effects in the sky and in the shadows, especially with so many trees around.”\n\nAvila, who is very artistic, recalls the light from the annular eclipse in October as very “startling”: “All of the trees down the street and in our yard started to cast the most unusual and weird shadows.”\n\nLily, age 12: “I haven’t seen a full eclipse, and it sounds really exciting.”\n\nCampion, age 10: “Our house is so perfect. We’re in the smack middle of it, so it’s going to be pitch black except the cool thing is that on the horizon it will be like a giant ring.”\n\nBenedict, age 8: “It turns out the whole sky turns black when it passes over us. Isn’t that amazing? We’re going to be in the smack middle.”\n\nGerard, age 5, wasn’t as keen to talk to me about this, but he did ask his mom if he would have to go to bed during the day because it will get dark.\n\nThey all promised to send me photos and videos to document their first ever total eclipse, and I look forward to seeing it through their eyes.\n\nWherever you are, I hope you, too, can experience this magnificent event.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

She was hooked.\n\nThat unusually bright comet, which flew by Earth in the mid-1990s,sparked her lifelong fascination with the night sky. Add to that the fact that she grew up in Alaska watching the aurora borealis on a regular basis, and it’s easy to see why she fell for starry nights early on. It also makes sense that her career now focuses on all things celestial.\n\nAs the founder of Space Tourism Guide and author of \"Dark Skies: A Practical Guide to Astrotourism,\" she loves getting others stoked on stellar encounters through astrotourism. This begs the question, what exactly is astrotourism?\n\nIt encompasses any travel related to astronomy experiences, she says, whether it’s a solar eclipse, meteor shower, rocket launch, or even something more off-worldly like taking a zero-gravity flight or eventually going to space.\n\nIf you can, try to plan your trip around an astronomy event. In 2021, Stimac says to consider the lunar occultation of Mars in April, total lunar eclipse in May, lunar occultation of Venus in November and total solar eclipse over Antarctica in December.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“The best astronomical phenomena in 2020 were ones we didn't necessarily know to plan for – Comet NEOWISE was only discovered in March,” she says. “I'm also excited for what new wonders we'll discover this year.”\n\nHere are several resorts with a focus on astronomy:\n\nHotel Jackson, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\n\nThe Wyoming wilderness is dazzling by day, of course, but by night, well, it’s even better. That said, there’s nothing quite like staying at Hotel Jackson, a four-star boutique property, for a bespoke, socially distanced stargazing experience. Wyoming Stargazing takes guests to Grand Teton National Park where they can bundle up in a blanket and cozy up in a camping chair while an astronomer guides them through the cosmic display. Back at the hotel, you’ll have views of the Snow King and the Jackson Valley Mountains. Plan a day trip to nearby Yellowstone National Park to hit the slopes or go for a hike.\n\nStimac recommends paying attention to the moon phase and dressing in layers. “The moon is astonishingly bright and can prevent you from seeing the stars in that area of the sky,” she explains. \"If you want to go stargazing without the moon, aim for nights near the new moon – or plan to enjoy some moongazing during the rest of the month.”\n\n“Next, don't underestimate how cold it gets once the sun goes down,” she says. “It's better to pack too many layers than to have your stargazing session cut short because you get cold.”\n\nGetting there: Fly into Jackson Hole Airport, and the hotel’s luxury car will pick you up.\n\nHyatt Regency and Ritz-Carlton, Maui, Hawaii\n\nMaui meets all the requirements for epic stargazing: fantastic weather all year, barely any light pollution and impeccable star visibility. Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa is a seaside escape known for its focus on the stars. For two decades, Edward Mahoney has served as the director of astronomy for the hotel’s Tour of the Stars program. Needless to say, he can answer nearly any question you come up with. And, since Maui is just 20 degrees north of the equator, guests can gaze at 80 of the 88 constellations. Choose from an 8 or 9 p.m. nightly astronomy session for your glimpse of the crystal-clear skies. Or book the romance tour at 10 p.m., which comes with sparkling wine and chocolate-covered strawberries.\n\nNearby, The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua has a stargazing program, where guests learn about the significant role the Polynesian voyagers played in the migration to Hawaii. Plus, telescopes are available upon request so you can spot constellations throughout your stay. When you’re ready to venture outside of the five-star hotel, there are miles of hiking trails to choose from and six beaches to lounge on. Once you’re out of energy, treat yourself to a deep-muscle massage, oxygen-renewal facial and a coconut-mango pedicure or a private cabana by the pool. If you are there from December to March, keep those eyes peeled for whales. Thousands of humpbacks visit Maui’s shores to breed and give birth in the warm waters.\n\nGetting there: Maui is open for tourism with some travel protocols and restrictions. Hawaiian Airlines has nonstop flights from several major cities.\n\nFour Seasons Resort, Bora Bora\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when you think of Tahiti might be overwater bungalows and stunning turquoise water. But stargazing should also top the list. Bora Bora happens to be one of the best places to view the Southern hemisphere sky.\n\nFor the ultimate stargazing getaway, make a beeline to the Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora, where the overwater bungalows make for the perfect spot to lounge and look up at the stars. Come nighttime, get cozy on your patio lounge chairs and gaze at the night sky with the sound of waves rolling below. With no light pollution and perfect clarity, it’s often possible to see the Milky Way and the Southern Cross.\n\n“Many of our guests are coming for an escape from the big cities, traffic, noise and stress,” says Etienne Baldeschi, head concierge at the resort. “The environment here is really about privacy, romance, peace and exploration, so stargazing fits right in and is enjoyed here by almost every guest to various degrees.”\n\nTo learn more about the night sky, book a stargazing session with Vavau where guests take a sunset cruise to a motu (small island) and learn about how ancient Polynesians used celestial navigation.\n\nGetting there: You’ll have to wait for tourism to reopen in French Polynesia before you visit. But once it does, book an Air Tahiti Nui direct flights from Los Angeles International Airport to Tahiti. Find the latest travel restrictions here.\n\nAmangiri Resort, Canyon Point, Utah\n\nAt Amangiri Resort, a 600-acre paradise near Page, Arizona, guests can sign up for a complimentary stargazing session with the in-house astronomer. There’s even an astrophotography machine that allows up to 10 users to connect wirelessly and download astrophotos from the machine directly to their device. With Amangiri being super remote, the stargazing is spectacular.\n\nCome nighttime, rest your head in a suite with a sky terrace (that makes stargazing quite simple). During the day, spend time trekking through the national parks and kicking back at Aman Spa for a healing Navajo-inspired treatment. During the daytime, explore nearby natural wonders like the majestic Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Adventurous types will appreciate climbing the via ferrata route, exploring slot canyons, or hot-air ballooning at sunrise.\n\nGetting there: Page Municipal Airport is located 25 minutes from Amangiri and is the closest airport.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/07/solar-eclipses-celestial-events-dazzle/73218377007/", "title": "Solar eclipses never fail to dazzle us. Astronomers aren't surprised.", "text": "It's not often that solar eclipses race across our skies, the moon blotting out the sun to usher in captivating rings of fire like in October or complete and utter darkness such as what will transpire Monday.\n\nThough it's only been a matter of six months since the annular solar eclipse, it's more common for years and years to pass between these spectacular celestial events.\n\nAnd when they do occur, they're undeniably beautiful.\n\nBecause the events are so rare and so mystifying, astronomers say it's no surprise that the years have done little to dampen the awe-inspiring power eclipses hold over us. Whenever one is set to occur, the promise of catching a glimpse of such a dazzling spectacle – whether it be a complete eclipse or only a partial one – always manages to capture the public's attention.\n\n\"I think humans have a deep connection with the night sky,\" Cameron Hummels, director of astrophysics outreach at the California Institute of Technology, previously told USA TODAY. \"Astronomical events like eclipses, meteor showers, and the northern lights are a way in which they can experience it first hand.\"\n\nYour guide to the eclipse:What to know before totality hits Monday\n\nTotal solar eclipse is chance for millions to see totality, corona\n\nThe phenomenon of an eclipse is rare enough as it is, but the upcoming astral display will quite literally be a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle to behold. Compared to the last total solar eclipse in 2017, this year's even will produce a brighter corona around the sun, a larger moon and a longer totality.\n\nMillions of Americans have now long been eagerly awaiting what will be their only chance until 2044 to witness totality, whereby the moon will completely block the sun's disc, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness.\n\nAmericans across the country will flock Monday to eclipse watch parties at libraries, national parks and other venues to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon, which will pass over portions of Mexico, the United States and Canada. Here in the U.S., 13 states fall directly in the path of totality, which will offer the most captivating views.\n\nThe process and reasons for an eclipse have long been understood by scientists, but it hasn't diminished the excitement that bubbles up anytime an eclipse approaches. Many astronomers, like Christopher Sirola from the University of Southern Mississippi, even view eclipses as an opportunity to harness public captivation to educate about the science behind the phenomenon.\n\n\"Solar eclipses are very predictable, but their regularities are not obvious,\" Sirola said. \"Such events are awesome, especially total solar eclipses.\"\n\nEclipses offer scientists a chance to study sun\n\nWe may think of astronomers and astrophysicists as studious and objective observers of the skies, but solar eclipses are equally exciting for them.\n\nAnd while much of that eager anticipation is purely for the celestial light show that will be on display, there's an academic reason as well.\n\nDescribing eclipses as \"a cosmic masterpiece,\" Elsayed Talaat of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told USA TODAY that the celestial events afford scientists an opportunity to study the sun much closer than normal.\n\nTotal solar eclipses in particular, such as the one that will overtake a large swath of the country in April, allow for scientists to test and improve human understanding of the laws of physics, primarily those of the sun. Veiled by the massive star's bright light, the sun's corona becomes visible during a total eclipse, allowing astronomers to conduct observations normally impossible, said Talaat, director of NOAA's Office of Space Weather Observations.\n\nAt NASA, for instance, a team of engineering physicists plan to launch three sounding rockets Monday toward the sun to study how a loss of sunlight alters Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe corona to this day remains shrouded in mystery, as Talaat said scientists are unsure of just why the outermost layer is able to reach a temperature of 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 10,000 degrees measured on the surface of the sun itself.\n\nScientists at NOAA use a telescopic device called a coronagraph to replicate the effects of an eclipse by blocking out the direct light from the sun in order to measure a corona year-round without relying on the moon's orbit.\n\nNOAA’s newest geostationary satellite will carry a coronagraph onboard when it launches for deep space next year, while a 2025 mission will also bring another device roughly 1 million miles away from earth to allow for unobstructed observations of the corona.\n\nHowever, Talaat admits there's nothing like seeing an eclipse for yourself.\n\n\"It's very different to be able to see it with your own eyes from the ground; that's a very powerful experience for me,\" Talaat said. \"It reminds me — it reminds us — that the sun is powerful in ways we don't fully understand or quite appreciate.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

What to know about 'planet parade'", "text": "Stargazers who have heard of an amazing planetary alignment coming later in January may be in for a letdown if they look up at the night sky expecting to be dazzled.\n\nYes, six planets will be visible in the January night sky. And yes, they'll be in a line.\n\nBut because planets always appear in a line from our Earth-bound vantage, the alignment isn't anything out of the norm. What's less common, according to astronomers, is seeing so many bright planets at once.\n\nHere's what to know about this month's so-called planetary parade, including how and where to see it.\n\nThe cosmos:4 events that dazzled skygazers in 2024, from total solar eclipse to northern lights\n\nWill the planets align in January?\n\nThe planets in our solar system orbit the sun essentially along a line across the sky in a plane called the ecliptic.\n\nFor that reason, planets in our Earthly sky always appear somewhere along a line, according to EarthSky, a website dedicated to cosmic news. These events, while commonplace, are often referred to as planetary alignments.\n\nThe ecliptic is also the reason that we on Earth sometimes observe planets appearing to approach closely to each other in the sky \"while they careen around the cosmic racetrack,\" according to NASA.\n\nWhile alignments themselves aren't special, what could be noteworthy for stargazers is the six planets that will be visible this month – including four with the naked eye. Such an event is commonly known as a \"planet parade,\" though NASA noted that the moniker is not a technical astronomical term.\n\nWhat is a planet parade, and what will be visible?\n\nPlanet parades are how astronomers and stargazers refer to the events when the planets form a straight line and look like they're marching across the night sky, such as a similar parade that took place in June.\n\nIn January, four bright planets and two faint planets will be visible in the night sky.\n\nHere's a list of the planets that will be visible in some for this month:\n\n◾ Venus\n\n◾ Saturn\n\n◾ Jupiter\n\n◾ Mars\n\n◾ Uranus\n\n◾ Neptune\n\n\"These multiplanet viewing opportunities aren’t super rare, but they don’t happen every year, so it’s worth checking it out,\" NASA said in a rundown of January sky-watching tips.\n\nHow and when to see the planetary parade\n\nVenus and Saturn already had their close approach, called a \"conjunction,\" last week.\n\nBut all month after dark, spectators can find Venus and Saturn in the southwest for the first couple of hours, while Jupiter shines brightly high overhead and Mars rises in the east. All four planets will be visible to the naked eye.\n\nUranus and Neptune will also be around, but they won't be appearing as brightly and will require a telescope to see, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

A coronal mass ejection of plasma clouds and charged particles driving the storm prompted NOAA's Space Prediction Center to issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch for the second time this year.\n\nDespite the threat the solar storm poses to satellites, GPS signals and power grids, the storm watch is good news for aurora chasers: Because of the way the solar particles interact with Earth's magnetosphere, the powerful eruption should make the vibrant northern lights visible to a wider swath of the northern hemisphere than usual.\n\nHere's what to know about the northern lights and how to potentially see them Thursday night in the United States.\n\nLove reading about Earth? Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for exclusive analysis about our planet.\n\nPeak northern lights activity:What to know about auroras as sun reaches solar maximum\n\nNOAA issues rare G4 solar storm watch, tracks coronal mass ejection\n\nNOAA has been tracking a coronal mass ejection since Tuesday that exploded from the sun on a trajectory that should reach Earth by midday Thursday.\n\nForecasters use a five-level scale to measure geometric storms, which are caused when coronal mass ejections release solar particles and electromagnetic radiation toward our planet. At a G4, this one is just a single level away from being the most severe solar storm possible, according to NOAA.\n\nStorm watches at the G4 level don't come along very often: The last one issued by NOAA in May was the first since 2005.\n\nThe May geomagnetic storm was a record-setting whopper, powerful enough to cause power grid irregularities and interference with GPS signals – even farming equipment. On the bright side, it did also unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nWhere will the auroras be visible?\n\nWhile the northern lights are famously best scene at the poles of the planet, powerful geomagnetic storms can reveal them to wider swaths of the globe.\n\nThursday's incoming geomagnetic storm has a Kp index 8, meaning the auroras will move even further towards the equator and become very bright and very active, according to NOAA.\n\n\"These are the events that create the best aurora and the extended auroral oval will be observable by the most people, the agency explains. \"At these levels, aurora may be seen directly overhead from the northern states.\"\n\nThursday night, the northern lights just might be visible over much of the northern half of the United States, and perhaps as far south as Alabama to northern California, according to SWPC's experimental Aurora viewline. The visibility for viewing will also depend on local weather conditions and city lights.\n\nStates best positioned within the aurora viewing line include:\n\nAlaska\n\nWashington\n\nIdaho\n\nMontana\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinnesota\n\nMichigan\n\nWisconsin\n\nThe auroras may also be \"highly active\" in parts of Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas and North Carolina, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon,\n\nWhen is the best time to see northern lights?\n\nThe upcoming solar storm will have particles flowing from the sun that get caught up in Earth's magnetic field, causing colorful auroras to form as they interact with molecules of atmospheric gases. The resulting glowing green and reddish colors of the aurora may be quite a sight to see – if you look up at the right time.\n\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that has fascinated humans for millennia.\n\nIf the weather is clear, the best aurora is usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, according to NOAA.\n\nThe agency maintains an aurora dashboard that should help skygazers track the phenomenon.\n\nWhy solar activity is creating more auroras\n\nFortunately for aurora chasers, there will be far more opportunities to catch the northern lights soon.\n\nElectromagnetic activity is increasing as the sun continues to reach the height of its 11-year solar cycle, which NASA said is expected to be in 2025.\n\nAs the sun reaches the peak of Solar Cycle 25, sunspots located in regions of intense magnetic activity should increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When that magnetic activity is released, it creates intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares hurtling toward Earth at the speed of light.\n\nSome of these flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\n\nThese ejections can collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest impacts of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms that unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Monty, a 5-year-old male from New Jersey, won the Working Group three consecutive times, but fell short of the top honor the two previous times, until now. His win made history. Monty is the first Giant Schnauzer to ever win Best in Show and the first Working Group dog to win Best in Show since 2004, ending the longest drought of any particular group. The winner was selected by Best in Show judge Paula Nykiel out of Washington, Missouri.\n\n\"He always tries so hard. I’m just so proud of him. I call him my Secretariat because he never stops,\" Monty's handler, Kate Bernadin, said after the win, while holding back emotions. \"Puppy did the damn thing.\"\n\nBourbon the Whippet, who came out of retirement at 9.5 years old for the competition, was named the Reserve Best in Show, the runner-up to the greatest dog in America.

The Terrier Group has produced 47 Best in Show winners, the most out of the seven groups. Archer the Skye terrier won the group in his \"retirement show,\" his handler said.\n\nWorking Group: Monty the giant schnauzer\n\nThird time's a charm? Monty, a 5-year-old giant schnauzer from New Jersey, has won the Working Group for the third consecutive time. Can Monty make history? A giant schnauzer has never won Best in Show. The Working Group has won Best in Show 15 times before, most recently in 2004 with a Newfoundland.\n\nSporting Group: Freddie the English Springer Spaniel\n\nFreddie, an English springer spaniel from Milan, Illinois, won the Sporting Group, besting 34 other dogs. The breed excels in hunting and performance and has won Best in Show six times, most recently in 2006. Fun fact: George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, had an English springer spaniel named Millie.\n\nHound Group: Bourbon the Whippet\n\nBourbon the whippet wasn’t originally scheduled to compete this week. The 9-year-old has been retired since 2021, but she came out of retirement on a whim. “Since (retirement) she’s been a mom. She’s had puppies. She’s been our companion and pet. She got here (at Westminster) and she was ready to go, so we decided to give it a go,\" her handler revealed. Bourbon now has a chance at Best in Show. She previously won Reserve Best in Show twice (2020, 2021) at Westminster, but never the main prize.\n\nNon-Sporting Group: Neal the Bichon Frisé\n\nNeal, a bichon frise from Mabank, Texas, won the Non-Sporting Group. A bichon frise has won Best in Show two times, most recently in 2018. Neal is one of 16 bichon frises that entered the competition this year.\n\nToy Group: Comet the shih tzu\n\nA male shih tzu from Monclova, Ohio, named “Comet” topped the Toy Group for the second consecutive year. Shih tzus were first recognized in 1969 and were bred in China, crossing ancient Chinese and Tibetan breeds. Shih tzus in the show ring are known for having long, flowing coats and “Comet” was no exception with his gold, white and silver coat.\n\nHerding Group: Mercedes the German shepherd\n\nMercedes, the German shepherd from Bethesda, Maryland, was named last year's Reserve Best in Show. Mercedes has another chance at winning big after topping the herding group for the second consecutive year. German shepherds have experienced great success at Westminster with wins in the Herding Group in 2016, 2017, 2022, 2024 and now 2025.\n\nWhat is the 2025 Westminster dog show schedule?\n\nTuesday, Feb. 11: Preliminary judging continues in the remaining three groups (Javits Center), with the top finishers advancing to the Best of Breed competition (Madison Square Garden).\n\nBest in Show honors will be announced after the judging concludes on Tuesday night.\n\nDog Show Day 2\n\n8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ET, Jacob K.

But all existing U.S. and Chinese duties, including those announced Monday, will shave growth by three-tenths of a percentage point next year, says Oxford economist Greg Daco. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi expects an even bigger impact of nearly half a percentage point.\n\nThe fallout for investors has been more prominent. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 600 points Monday. That’s partly because multinational corporations with significant exports could see less revenue and profits, Zandi says. The bigger toll is on business confidence and investment, he says.\n\n“It raises the probability of a full-blown trade war, which will hammer earnings,” Zandi says.\n\nSo far, China has slapped tariffs on $100 billion in U.S. goods. As a result, U.S.exports to China fell 7% in 2018, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. And Chinese investment in the U.S. was down 60% last year, “in part because of added scrutiny applied to proposed deals and a souring political climate,” the group says.\n\nU.S. farmers, who have been especially affected by China’s tariffs last year, are likely to suffer an additional blow.\n\nJohn Heisdorffer, a soybean farmer in Keota, Iowa, has lost about $10,000 since China put a 25% levy on U.S. soybean shipments last year as prices fell from more than $10 a bushel to about $8. U.S. soybean exports to China effectively halted before rising modestly recently as part of Chinese concessions during negotiations. Heisdorffer says he has cut back on investments in new equipment.\n\nAfter Monday’s news, soybean futures fell another seven cents. Although soybeans aren’t directly affected by the latest round of Chinese tariffs, various soy-related oils and extracts will be hit.\n\n“I thought it was going to be resolved last week,” Heisdorffer says. “I don’t know what to think now. It continues to ratchet down the amount of cash we have to pay bills.\"\n\nIf the conflict drags on, he says, there won’t be anything left to give his son, who plans to take over the farm when Heisdorffer, 67, retires.\n\nHeisdorffer, who is chairman of the American Soybean Association, also worries the number of soybean farmers who go bankrupt will increase substantially if the latest Chinese tariff isn’t removed. “People are going to be hanging by a thread,” he says.\n\nDow:Dow stock swings are exhausting, but here's how to survive\n\nSocial media pressure:Young people, scrolling their friends' Instagram feeds, feel pressure to overspend\n\nStefanie Smallhouse, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, said the prospects of tariffs that could undercut exports to China come at an already bad time for the state’s agricultural industry.\n\nFarmers and ranchers already have been paying higher prices for equipment, seed, fertilizer and other expenditures – partly due to tariffs that raised the price of steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. Plus, they face uncertainty in exporting to Mexico and Canada pending approval of a revamped North American trade agreement.\n\n“We’re being squeezed on both sides,” said Smallhouse, who with her husband owns a livestock ranch near Tucson. “At this point, it’s a downhill slide.”\n\nLonger term, the tariffs and heightened trade tensions mean farmers and ranchers face missed opportunities and the prospect of losing market share in China, which she described as an important export destination for Arizona agricultural products, especially dairy and meat.\n\nChina also represents the third-largest export market for U.S. chemical makers. Last year, U.S. chemical exports to China rose just 2.7% after notching double-digit gains in 2016 and 2017. The U.S. offers high-quality, inexpensive products, largely because of cheap prices for natural gas, a feedstock for many chemicals used to make plastics, oil-related goods, pharmaceuticals, construction and other products in China, Brzytwa of the ACC says.\n\nWith many chemical makers eyeing China as a prime market, about $200 billion in new factories are being planned in the U.S. But some could move to other countries if the newest tariff remains, Brzytwa says. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers could shift their chemical purchases to domestic suppliers or other Asian countries.\n\nBASF, a Germany-based chemical manufacturer with more than 100 facilities in North America, said it's \"concerned about the U.S. announcements, and the response of several of its trading partners, to impose import tariffs on a wide range of products that could affect the chemical industry and its numerous customer industries.\"\n\nThe company said it's still assessing the potential effects of the latest round of increased Chinese tariffs on its American operations.\n\nContributing: Russ Wiles, Arizona Republic; Yan Zhang; Nathan Bomey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/31/tariffs-trump-mexico-import-tariffs-could-hurt-consumers/1299579001/", "title": "Tariffs: Trump Mexico import tariffs could hurt consumers", "text": "An American economy and shopper already bracing for an escalation in the U.S. trade war with China was hit by an equally damaging blow this week when President Donald Trump unexpectedly ratcheted up his battle with Mexico.\n\nFrom produce to cars, a wide variety of Mexican goods could become more expensive if Trump follows through on his threat to hit Mexican imports with tariffs that soon could climb to 25%. Trump wants to pressure Mexico into doing more to halt the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S. via the Mexican border.\n\nThe tariffs, set to begin June 10, would gradually climb to 25% on Oct. 1 if Mexico doesn’t take steps “to dramatically reduce or eliminate” the number of migrants, Trump said Thursday. Such a strategy would hurt American shoppers, the economy and stocks, experts say, just as U.S. growth is slowing and the threat of more tariffs on Chinese imports looms larger.\n\nAfter the first 5% tariff in June, tariffs would increase by 5 percentage points each month before reaching 25% on Oct. 1\n\nMexican tariffs rattle stocks:Dow, stocks end lower on threat of tariffs on Mexican imports and recession fears\n\nNeed a break?

Top imports are vehicles, machinery, TVs, furniture, appliances and agricultural products such as avocados and other vegetables, and beer and wine.\n\nCan Trump legally use tariffs to prod Mexico on immigration?\n\nThe International Emergency Economic Powers act of 1977 does give the president the authority to impose tariffs in a national emergency. Trump has said he regards the influx of migrants through Mexico as such a crisis, using it to justify a shutdown of the Mexican border earlier this year. But Fred Bergsten, co-founding president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says that claim is dubious and almost certainly would be challenged in court. Even if the border crossings represent an emergency, it’s highly questionable that Mexico could stop them, he says. A federal judge could order the tariffs removed while the case is hashed out in court, Bergsten says.\n\nHow much would prices go up?\n\nA 5% tariff would likely be absorbed by retailers and manufacturers. But much of a 25% tariff likely would be passed on to shoppers, Bergsten figures, increasing costs by up $86 billion across the economy. The Trade Partnership, a research group, thinks the overall total of tariffs will be less simply because U.S. retailers and manufacturers will buy less product from Mexico because of the duties.\n\nLet’s break it down. How about car prices?\n\nWhile a 5% tariff could have no effect, prices could go up by several thousand dollars per model in the worst case scenario – permanent 25% tariffs, says Jeff Schuster, president of global vehicle forecasting at LMC Automotive.\n\nFor example, a $30,000 vehicle imported from Mexico would suddenly be hit with $7,500 in duties. How much automakers pass on to car buyers depends on how long the tariffs last, he says.\n\nKey models imported from Mexico to the U.S. include, for example, the second- and third-most popular models in America: Fiat Chrysler’s Ram pickup and GM’s Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Automakers would want to avoid major spikes in individual models, choosing instead to spread out the costs across their entire lineup.\n\nAll told, Deutsche Bank projected an average price increase of about $1,300 per vehicle.\n\n“For the consumer I think initially it’s a wait and see, but it could become costly,” Schuster said.\n\nAnd car parts would be affected, too. “So even holding on to an existing vehicle will become more expensive,” according to the Center for Automotive Research.\n\nWhere else could shoppers feel the impact?\n\nOne of the first places is the supermarket. Mexico sold U.S. grocers $26.2 billion worth of food in 2017. The produce section is especially vulnerable. Half of Mexican food imports are fruits and vegetables. Produce has a shorter shelf life than items like beer, so U.S. supermarkets will start paying them faster than products that may be sitting in a warehouse.\n\nSupermarkets may try to mitigate higher Mexican imports by buying some imports from other countries – but that’s harder to do for some categories: Almost 95% of imported strawberries come from Mexico. Supermarkets may also try to blunt the higher costs of some items by raising prices of higher-volume staples that are less affected. So even though 7% of banana imports come from Mexico, a grocer might raise those prices slightly to keep from raising avocado prices (almost 90% of imports from Mexico) too sharply.\n\nWhat else on store shelves?\n\nBeer. Mexico is a top exporter of beers thanks to the popularity of brands like Corona, Modelo and Dos Equis. The U.S. imported $3.2 billion worth of Mexican beer in 2017. Mexico also exported more than $1.3 billion in Tequila and other liquors.\n\nWould this make my guacamole very expensive?\n\nAvocados imported from Mexico have become a mainstay of the American diet. For example, of the 51 million pounds in the U.S. the week of May 19, almost 37 million came from Mexico, according to the most recent data from the marketing group Avocados from Mexico.\n\nPhil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago, said that while the proposed tariff is 5%, shoppers would end up paying 10% more at stores and, at least at the beginning, California avocados could cover some of it.\n\nHome prices:Pricey homes in these 15 US cities put them at risk of a housing crisis\n\nHit to the wallet:The expense nearly half of Americans think can bankrupt them\n\nWhat would this mean for my summer picnic?\n\nIt depends on what you serve. The U.S. imports plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables besides avocados, including cucumbers, berries, tomatoes, lemons and limes.\n\nPhil Lempert, founder of supermarketguru.com, which tracks industry news and trends, says prices for all foods from Mexico could catapult to more than 20% higher.\n\n“What we’re going to see happen is Mexico, as we’ve seen with China, will find other partners (to sell) produce to, beer to, tequila to,” he said. “What I think will happen is that resource for us will dry up. We’ll have scarcity, so prices will go much higher than 5%.”\n\nHow about electronics?\n\n“A lot of parts come out of China but a lot of production and assembly go on at the Mexican border,” says Sage Chandler, vice president for international trade policy at the Consumer Technology Association.\n\nTop consumer tech imports include desktop PCs and servers ($24.3 billion in 2018), TVs, ($8 billion) and refrigerators and freezers ($3.8 billion), the CTA says.\n\nChandler says there’s a lot of confusion coming out of the White House. Would tariffs apply to products made in Mexico that come into the U.S. or anything that ships from Mexico regardless of its country of origin? And some tariffs could be applied, she says, on multiple occasions, as products or parts move back and forth across the border.\n\nConsumers are price sensitive when it comes to tech products, and consumer electronics companies could even cancel planned back-to-school promotions or deals tied to Amazon Prime Day, says Bernie Thompson, CEO of Plugable, a leading developer of docking stations and other computer peripherals.\n\nHow would tariffs affect mall purchases?\n\nIt's unclear which goods would see the biggest price hikes as retailers often shy away from sharing pricing strategies for specific items in advance. However, Mexico’s textile exports to the U.S. are sizable. Produce, appliances and electronics and clothiers could be affected heavily if the tariffs were to occur, according to Daniel Martins, the founder of DM Martins Research.\n\nWhat would the effect be on the U.S. economy?\n\nA 25% tariff would reduce economic growth next year by seven-tenths of a percentage point, says economist Greg Daco of Oxford Economics. It would mean 600,000 fewer jobs. And that doesn't include the impact of the tariffs Mexico would impose on U.S. exports in retaliation. Throw in that and proposed tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese imports later this year and the spreading trade war could tip the country into recession.\n\nWhy did Trump take this dramatic step?\n\nBesides pressuring Mexico on illegal immigration, Goldman Sachs says Trump hopes the gambit prods Congress into finally passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as the new NAFTA. The administration earlier Thursday submitted the text of the deal to Congress, launching a process for lawmakers to vote on it.\n\nCould the strategy work?\n\nBergsten says it could work by forcing Mexico to take more aggressive steps to curb immigration. After all, exports to the U.S. make up about 30% of the Mexican economy, according to Oxford, and 25% tariffs are likely to topple that country into recession. It’s not clear, though, how well Mexico will respond to such a brass-knuckled approach, Bergsten says. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have indicated the tariffs will only make them less likely to pass USMCA.\n\n“It’s very risky,” Bergsten says. “It could blow up the whole” trade agreement while burdening Americans with higher prices.\n\nHow about stocks?\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 354 points Friday, or 1.4%, as investors blindsided by the tariffs worried they could undercut the trade deal or even lead to a recession.\n\nWill Mexico retaliate?\n\nMexican officials said they will respond strongly. So expect tariffs on virtually all U.S. goods exported to Mexico if the U.S. hits Mexico with a 25% duty. U.S. exports to Mexico totaled $265 billion last year. Among the leading products are machinery, cars and plastics. Mexico is the nation’s second-largest market for agricultural products, especially corn, soybeans, dairy and pork. That would compound the struggles of American manufacturers and farmers already hobbled by China’s tariffs.\n\nContributing: Edward C.

While these tariffs did not affect our products, in May 2019, the United States proposed an additional tariff of up to 25% on essentially all remaining Chinese-origin imports, which likely would cover our products. Imposition of the latest proposed tariffs was suspended after a June 2019 meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders. However, on August 1, 2019, the Trump Administration announced that it currently plans to go forward with additional tariffs of 10% on the products subject to the May proposal, effective September 1, 2019.\n\nTrade negotiations, between the countries as well as between domestic importers and the U.S. government, evolve rapidly.

While this behavior could boost short-term holiday sales, it underscores broader economic uncertainty.\"\n\nConsumer sentiment revealed a partisan divide in 2024, she said. Republicans reported newfound optimism, while Democrats expressed growing concerns.\n\nIt's not just consumers buying out of fear. Morrissey said when he attended a buying show in January to source goods for his store, the talk at the convention was the possibility of tariffs raising prices. He said some vendors were encouraging him to buy more products now because if he waited, the products would likely go up in price.\n\nAs a small business owner, though, Morrissey said he only has so much money to work with and decided not to extend himself and gamble on the bet that vendors' prices will rise.\n\nStill, many analysts and retailers say momentum is expected to continue into this year.\n\nWhat the retail picture could look like in 2025\n\nWhen asked to predict their sales outlook for January through March, 41% of Michigan retailers predicted their sales will continue to rise, 34% said they expect their sales to decline, and 25% anticipate no change, the Michigan Retailers Association survey found.\n\nTapper noted that while most of Tapper's customers are ones who can afford luxury items, even Tapper's comparatively lower-priced items are selling well, indicating to him that there's strength with that type of customer, too.\n\nFor example, he said Tapper's is running a promotion right now for a $99 special for a Valentine's gift.

Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nA large company like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) or Target (NYSE: TGT) can adjust to changes in its supply chain much easier than a small business can. Yes, it can sometimes be hard to steer a larger ship, but money solves a lot of problems.\n\nThat's why in the face of looming expanded tariffs on goods imported from China, retail's biggest players are well positioned. Prices will go up – Walmart's and Target's CEOs have already offered warnings on that – but these retail giants can take steps to protect their supply chain that small businesses can't.\n\nWhy is it harder for small businesses?\n\nWalmart and Target have the cash to buy more inventory before the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods kick in. They can monitor the situation and front-load purchases to have goods already imported before the cost of doing that increases.\n\nThat, of course, does have some cost. Warehousing and lengthening how long something sits in inventory costs money, but not nearly as much as paying an extra 25% in tariffs on imported items.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nA small business might be able to increase inventory slightly, but it's not likely to have the free capital to make big buys ahead of the tariffs being implemented. In addition, smaller companies that make those big advance purchases may put their survival in jeopardy if consumer demand shifts before the items can actually be sold.\n\nLarge retailers also have the buying power to change their supply chain. If Walmart or Target want goods made in countries not being impacted by tariffs, they have the muscle to take supply away from smaller players.\n\nThat's not particularly fair, but it happens quite often when demand for an item exceeds supply. The big boys that can place larger orders get served first and small business gets what's left.\n\n\"The Administration's decision to announce a tax on every product coming from China puts America's entire economy at risk,\" according to a statement from the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA). \"No product category will be spared if this latest threat materializes. Food and home goods, clothing and shoes, toys and electronics – Americans' entire shopping cart will get more expensive.\"\n\nConsequences:Here are 5 steps China could take to hurt the US beyond more tariffs\n\nSoybeans:Tariffs pause China's purchases, report says\n\nIt's a tax\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell is the chairman of RILA, which counts Walmart as a \"premier\" member. The group has made it very clear that it's against tariffs, and it takes a bolder stand than most individual chains do – likely because a trade association does not have to fear political fallout in the same way a brand does.\n\n\"Retailers have long held out hope that President Donald Trump would negotiate a trade deal that checks Chinese anti-competitive practices and intellectual property theft. But a massive increase in tariffs does not correct Chinese bad behavior, it punishes American families,\" RILA said in its statement. \"Tariffs are taxes, and if this latest threat takes effect, this will likely be the largest tax increase on consumers in American history.\"\n\nThese are taxes that even the biggest players in retail can't keep from impacting their customers. Small business owners will have an even harder time because they don't have the buying power, cash, or flexibility that their giant competitors do.\n\nIf these tariffs are implemented, then small businesses importing goods from China will suffer. That suffering will be magnified by companies like Target and Walmart being able to avoid some of the impact, creating an even greater price divide. In that scenario, it's easy to see how some smaller players may get priced out of existence.\n\nAnd this won't just hurt mom-and-pop stores. It could be the tipping point for retailers like J.C.

These include a 15% tariff on 120 American products ranging from fruit to steel pipes, as well as a 25% tariff on eight other products including recycled aluminum and pork. The Chinese government made it clear that its actions were directly related to Trump's moves regarding steel and aluminum.\n\nIt's a back and forth that has set off talk of these battles escalating into a full-scale trade war.

We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,\" he said. \"To be clear, we agree it's time to address China's unfair trade practices, but an additional $100 billion in tariffs amount to $100 billion in taxes on the American people. Tax reform delivered a real benefit to working families, and tariffs take them away.\"\n\nFor Trump, the tariffs are a negotiating ploy.\n\n\"The United States is still prepared to have discussions in further support of our commitment to achieving free, fair, and reciprocal trade and to protect the technology and intellectual property of American companies and American people,\" Trump said in a statement after he asked the USTR for additional tariffs.\n\nFear of escalation\n\nThe NRF's CEO does not see China quickly backing down. While not naming Trump in his press release, Shay was quoted as saying:\n\nThese tit-for-tat trade actions could spell disaster for the U.S. economy and make it harder for Americans across the country to afford everyday products and basic necessities. It is inevitable that China will respond with more retaliatory actions that cause even further harm to American farmers, businesses, and consumers. We urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation's economy.\n\nWill either side back down?\n\nAlthough it remains possible negotiations will stop the escalating battles, it's hard to see the U.S. and China trading tariff announcements as anything other than the start of a trade war that could have near-immediate financial consequences for the American people, as Shay noted above.\n\nIt's worth mentioning, however, that the NRF does not disagree with the president on the concept of dealing with China's trade practices. It only takes issue of an approach that puts the American public in a position to pay more for imported goods from China when that might have been avoided with diplomacy.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.”\n\nTrump, who used the same provision of trade law, Section 232 of of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, revealed that plan with steelworkers by his side. This plan, auto executives say, blindsided them.\n\nTrump in March rolled out 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, but offered temporary exemptions to the European Union, Canada, Mexico and a number of other allies. India and China are challenging the tariffs before the World Trade Organization, Reuters reported.\n\nAnalysts wondered whether Trump's auto announcement wasn't both an effort to gain leverage in stalled trade negotiations and a play for votes in the industrial north — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois — as political parties vie for control of statehouses and the U.S. House as they head into a volatile midterm election cycle.\n\nOthers wondered if he was mainly seeking leverage in talks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, a deal he has deemed unfair and has vowed since the 2015-16 campaign to renegotiate.\n\nTrump teased the announcement in a tweet Wednesday morning, promising \"big news\" for U.S. autoworkers.\n\n\"After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the UAW declined to comment.\n\nInvestigation ordered\n\nThe president announced late Wednesday that he asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to investigate whether auto imports are a threat to national security.\n\n\"Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation,\" Trump said in a short statement released by the White House Press Office.\n\nImposing tariffs through Section 232 is not fast.

A $255 lump sum death benefit\n\nDave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., said the call for tariffs reflects a lack of understanding about how the industry works.\n\n\"There is no vehicle manufactured in the U.S. today that doesn't have at least one part from outside the U.S.,\" he said. \"Every vehicle assembled today requires a logistical symphony due to the far corners of the world that some parts come from. With the exception of Tesla, every vehicle manufacturer imports and exports vehicles based on U.S. consumer demand. GM and Ford have vehicles that come from Asia or Europe. Some are so low volume that they don't warrant manufacturing capacity in the U.S. to support it.\"\n\nSullivan said, \"This has the potential to reach far and wide and provide little to no benefit to U.S. consumers. This could also be the last straw for an all out trade war, as many countries are growing tiresome of threats.\"\n\nFact is, there are also some jobs that Americans just don't want to do, analysts said, such as hand stitching the leather of steering wheels or soldering printed circuit boards in a job market that is already strained with low unemployment.\n\n\"This could really backfire,\" Sullivan said. \"Also, the auto industry is very cyclical and if more manufacturing was moved to the U.S., we'd just increase our dependence and exposure to the waves of auto manufacturing and demand.\"\n\nAmerican automaking is thoroughly integrated into a global system of vehicle and parts production now.\n\n\"Republicans used to be supporters of free trade. I'm not sure where that got lost in this administration,\" Sullivan said.\n\n'We weren't briefed'\n\nAn industry official who is not authorized to speak publicly said blue-collar workers will like what they hear from Trump because it sounds like it supports jobs in America.\n\n\"Fact is, we weren't briefed on this. We didn't ask for it. Who was in the room?\" the industry official said.\n\nAnalysts also wondered if Trump doesn't genuinely think the tariff threats will be effective. Just this week, China significantly reduced its auto import tariff on vehicles.\n\nChina cutting auto import taxes as of July 1\n\n\"When the auto executives visited the White House, the president talked about imposing tariffs on imports. So the idea isn't new, but now they are offering a mechanism to implement it,\" the industry official said. \"This allows for executive action, unilateral action.\"\n\nThe industry official said, \"We'll see. It's a risky strategy.\"\n\nMichigan lawmakers on Capitol Hill were slow to respond to the president's latest comments but U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, reiterated a position held by many Midwestern Democrats: If the threat of tariffs leads to talks that can help domestic automakers, it might be worth it.\n\n\"American workers and automakers deserve the same access to markets in other countries that foreign companies have in the U.S. My hope is at end of this process they finally meet this goal,\" Dingell said.\n\nEveryone seems to agree that the best thing to do in the short term is wait and see what unfolds over the next six to 12 months, when a review must be completed to determine whether actions based on national security are justified.\n\nJonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said, “We are all learning that initial bluster can be just that, so time is needed to see what will actually come to pass. Like threats of changes to country of origin numbers in NAFTA, the impact to the industry would vary. A new import tariff would hurt luxury models the most. A tariff would raise prices and limit consumer choice but would encourage more domestic production. There would be winners and losers from such a move throughout the value chain if it comes to pass.”\n\nForeign companies in U.S.\n\nDomestic automakers now build vehicles in China, South Korea and other overseas locations and then ship them back to America.\n\nAnd the foreign-based car companies point out that they employ hundreds of thousands of Americans in manufacturing operations and car dealerships all over the country. Global Automakers lists state-by-state data on the multibillion dollar economic impacts of its members\n\nTo highlight a few; Honda builds in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana and Ohio; Toyota builds in Alabama, California, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas; Volkswagen builds in Tennessee; Hyundai builds in Alabama and Georgia; Kia builds in Georgia; BMW builds in South Carolina; Mercedes-Benz builds in Alabama, Indiana and South Carolina; Nissan builds in Mississippi and Tennessee; Subaru builds in Indiana.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations over NAFTA have dragged on with the president promising to renegotiate its terms or withdraw from it entirely. Congress has taken no action.\n\nTrump has indicated he may withdraw from the agreement that he — and many blue-collar voters and their labor leaders — have argued drive jobs out of America to Mexico and elsewhere. Yet automakers have been supportive of NAFTA, with partnerships and investments formed over the past two decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump railed about NAFTA talks.\n\n\"NAFTA is very difficult,\" he said as he boarded Marine One. \"Mexico is very difficult to deal with. Canada has been very difficult to deal with it. They have been taking advantage of the United States for a long time.\n\n\"I am not happy with their requests,\" he continued. \"But I will tell you, in the end, we win. We will win, and we'll win big. We'll get along with Mexico; we'll get along with Canada. But I will tell you, they have been very difficult to deal with. They're very spoiled — because nobody has done this. But I will tell you that what they ask for is not fair.\"\n\nTrump is exploring tariffs of as much as 25% on auto imports, the Wall Street Journal said.\n\n\"It seems designed to pressure Canada and Mexico to accept the U.S. proposal at the NAFTA table,\" Dziczek said. \"Could be, but there are plenty of UAW jobs tied to making engines, transmissions and other parts for vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nFor example, southeast Michigan is closely tied to Ontario in auto production, with more than $70 billion of vehicles, parts and other items traveling between the two each year.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department statement said: \"The investigation will determine whether imports of automobiles, including SUVs, vans and light trucks, and automotive parts into the United States threaten to impair the national security ... Secretary [Wilbur] Ross sent a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis informing him of the investigation.\n\n“There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,” Ross said in the release. “The Department of Commerce will conduct a thorough, fair and transparent investigation into whether such imports are weakening our internal economy and may impair the national security.”\n\nThe statement then goes on to say, \"From 1990 to 2017, employment in motor vehicle production declined by 22%, even though Americans are continuing to purchase automobiles at record levels ...

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSome of Harris’ stances seem to defy perceptions by nearly half of likely voters that she’s “too liberal,” according to a New York Times-Siena poll. She has shown a willingness to tack to the center by dropping her support for a fracking ban and favoring a lower capital gains tax rate than Biden for very wealthy Americans.\n\nWhat does Kamala Harris support? What about Donald Trump?\n\nOn the biggest economic issues facing the nation - trade, immigration and taxes – Harris’ policies largely mirror Biden’s and their effects on economic growth, jobs and inflation would be similar, according to analyses by Moody’s, Goldman Sachs and the Penn-Wharton Budget Model.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is also doubling down on his first-term agenda.\n\nHe aims to extend and expand his 2017 tax cuts for virtually all Americans, crack down harder on illegal immigration while deporting millions of foreign-born residents, impose fresh tariffs on U.S. imports, and roll back much of Biden’s plan to create a clean energy future.\n\nHarris would extend some of the Trump tax cuts − but not for wealthy individuals and corporations – raise taxes even higher for the richest Americans, impose more targeted tariffs on Chinese imports and toughen immigration curbs but not nearly as sweepingly as Trump.\n\nPredictions for the 2025 economy?\n\n“The economy under Trump would grow more slowly and will suffer higher inflation and interest rates,” Zandi said.\n\nIn a Trump presidency, “the hit to growth from tariffs and tighter immigration policy would outweigh” the positive effects of tax cuts, Goldman Sachs wrote in a report in early September.\n\nMore:Harris says Trump tariffs will cost Americans $4k/year. Some economists are skeptical.\n\nHarris’ new spending and middle-class tax reductions would “slightly more than offset lower investment due to higher corporate tax rates,” Goldman said. But in a split government, any effects likely would be small.\n\nTrump’s plan would spark a recession by mid-2025, Moody’s said. The economy would grow an average 1.3% annually during his four-year term versus 2.1% (in line with average gains before the pandemic) under Harris.\n\nUnder a Trump administration, inflation would rise from 3% this year to 3.5% in 2025, compared to 2.4% under Harris, the Moody’s analysis shows. At the end of a Trump tenure the U.S. would have 3.1 million fewer jobs than under Harris and a 4.5% unemployment rate, a half percentage point higher.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicted a less dramatic impact from a Trump term, with the economy growing a half percentage point slower next year and inflation about four-tenths of a percentage point higher.\n\nThe estimates are based on assumptions by both Moody’s and Goldman that a Harris administration would probably work with a Democratic-majority House and Republican Senate, reversing the current party set-up. By contrast, Trump probably would be swept in with a Republican House and Senate, according to election models.\n\nPolls, meanwhile, continue to show Americans view Trump as a better steward for the U.S. economy. About 45% trust him on the economy and inflation, compared to about 37% who trust Harris, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll in late August. But the gap between the public's views of the Republican and Democratic nominees on this key issue has narrowed since Harris replaced Biden as the nominee in late July.\n\nA look at how their plans could affect the economy.\n\nTariffs\n\nTrump’s plan\n\nIn his first term, Trump slapped tariffs on a tenth of U.S. imports, chiefly steel, washing machines and solar panels, as well as many goods from China. Long term, the $80 billion in tariffs are projected to cut the nation’s gross domestic product, or output, by 0.21% and reduce employment by 166,000 jobs, according to a study by the Tax Foundation.\n\nTrump would go much further this time. He has proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% levy on Chinese shipments in a bid to prod manufacturers to move production to the U.S.\n\nHarris’ plan\n\nHarris' campaign didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment on her economic policies. But a campaign spokesperson told the New York Times last month she would enact \"targeted and strategic tariffs\" to support workers and strengthen the economy.\n\nBiden similarly has used narrowly tailored tariffs to help U.S. companies compete with Chinese rivals that are subsidized by the government, including a 100% levy on Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nImpact\n\nHarris' tariffs would have little effect on the nation's economy, Zandi says.\n\nBut Trump’s 10% levy would boost annual inflation by nearly three-quarters of a percentage point next year and a half point in 2026 as businesses pass their increased costs to consumers, the Moody’s estimate shows.\n\nIn her Democratic convention speech, Harris said Trump's higher fees would cost middle-income families an additional $4,000 a year. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the added costs at $2,600.\n\nIn the end, Goldman figures new Trump tariffs likely would be more measured, focusing on Chinese imports and vehicles from Mexico and the European Union. That likely would boost inflation by half a percentage point, Goldman estimates.\n\nYet instead of narrowing the U.S. trade gap, the levies likely would strengthen the U.S. dollar by reducing imports and sparking higher inflation that pushes up interest rates, Moody's says. That would make the nation's exports more expensive overseas, widen the trade deficit and hurt American manufacturers. Other countries almost certainly would retaliate with their own tariffs, further dampening U.S. exports.\n\nOn the positive side, the stronger dollar would partly offset the added cost of the tariffs for U.S. consumers by making imports less costly, Goldman notes.\n\nOverall, the economy would suffer and there would be 2.1 million fewer U.S. jobs by 2028, Moody's says.\n\nTaxes\n\nTrump’s plan\n\nTrump and a Republican Congress would extend his 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act for households at all income levels and for corporations. The lower rates are set to expire next year.\n\nTrump also has said he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. The 2017 tax legislation lowered the rate from 35%. And he has advocated ending taxes for Social Security earnings and tips.\n\nExtending the tax breaks would add $5.2 trillion to deficits over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nHarris’ plan\n\nHarris would extend the lower personal income tax rates only for individuals earning less than $400,000 a year, trimming the deficit and curtailing inflation, Zandi says.\n\nLike Biden, Harris separately wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. But she also aims to hit the wealthiest households with a 25% minimum tax. And she would increase the capital gains tax rate for people earning more than $1 million a year from 20% to 28%, softening Biden’s plan to hike it to the top income tax rate of 39.6%.\n\nShe also has embraced Trump’s proposal to end taxes on tips.\n\nImpact\n\nLower corporate taxes rates tend to juice investment and economic growth. But the bang for the buck would be limited, Moody's says, because the nation is already near full employment, signaled by a robust economy in which everyone who wants to work and can work is employed. Further tax cuts would drive inflation higher.\n\nAs a result, the Fed would leave interest rates higher for longer, increasing corporate borrowing costs and partly offsetting the benefits of lower taxes.\n\nStill, the lower taxes for individuals and companies should lift spending and generate about 450,000 more jobs than Harris' plan, Moody's says.\n\nBut while extending the 2017 tax cuts are likely, Goldman doesn’t expect any of Trump’s new proposals, such as exempting Social Security income, to pass even a Republican Congress. And Moody’s figures Harris’ proposed tax hikes on the wealthy wouldn’t be approved by a split Congress.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump’s plan\n\nTrump vows to deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status. He also would reinstate programs that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are resolved or quickly return to that country.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has been criticized by Republicans for a surge in illegal immigration that has created a crisis at the southern border.\n\nHarris' plan\n\nHarris has touted the current border policies, including an executive action signed in June by Biden that beefed up enforcement, as working and has been talking tougher about pursuing criminals who enter the U.S. without legal permission.\n\n“I was attorney general of a border state,\" she said at a rally in Glendale, Arizona, in August, according to Roll Call. \"I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and the human traffickers...I prosecuted them in case after case and I won, so I know what I’m talking about.”\n\nAt the same time, she said she wants to provide migrants an earned pathway to citizenship.\n\nFor the longer term, Harris is seeking funding from Congress for more border patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to handle higher volumes of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.\n\nImpact\n\nTrump’s policies would reduce net immigration to the U.S. from about 3.3 million last year to about 750,000 annually, assuming a Republican-majority Congress, Goldman estimates. Harris’ plan, the firm says, likely would double that figure. Net immigration averaged about 1 million a year before the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\nImmigrants, both legal and those lacking proper authorization, have helped alleviate severe labor shortages, slowing wage growth and inflation.\n\nTrump's proposed crackdown and deportations would undo the gains, especially in industries such as agriculture, construction, restaurants, hotels and retail, Moody’s says.\n\nThe smaller labor force, Moody's says, would dampen economic growth and stoke inflation again as wages rise and companies rely on fewer workers to churn out products and services.\n\nThe Fed, in turn, which is set to start lowering interest rates in mid-September now that inflation has eased, could be forced to raise rates again or wait longer before cutting rates.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act\n\nTrump’s plan\n\nTrump likely would seek to roll back grants and subsidies promoting green energy in the Inflation Reduction Act, Moody's and Goldman say.\n\nImpact\n\nWhile it would save $369 billion, the cost is to be funded by stricter tax enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nSuch a move would cut economic growth by a half percentage point and wipe out 450,000 jobs in 2026, Moody's estimates. Goldman says there's little support even among Republicans for a wholesale repeal of the clean energy policies.\n\nSocial service policies\n\nHarris’ plan\n\nHarris has unveiled a litany of proposals to help low- and middle-income consumers. Among them, she would:\n\nCrack down on food and grocery companies that charge excessive prices during an emergency and landlords who collude to raise rents.\n\nContinue Biden’s push to increase the child tax credit to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for older children. She has also proposed a $6,000 credit for babies in their birth year.\n\nProvide $25,000 in downpayment assistance to first-time homebuyers, more than the $10,000 proposed by Biden.\n\nCreate a $40 billion fund to help developers build more affordable rental units for low-income people, double the amount Biden floated.\n\nExpand a monthly $35 cap on insulin and $2,000 yearly limit on out-of-pocket spending from seniors to all Americans.\n\nProvide a $50,000 tax deduction for small business start-ups, up from the current $5,000.\n\nImpact\n\nSuch programs would be offset by higher taxes on the wealthy and companies, and so wouldn't add to the deficit, Zandi says.\n\nMost, though, have little chance of being approved by a divided Congress, Moody's and Goldman say. A $25,000 payment for home buyers could come with a big downside because it would juice home sales and drive up prices, Zandi says.\n\nBut some type of increase in the child tax credit is likely even in a divided Congress, the economists say. And Moody’s expects more funding for low-income housing.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/10"}]}

What does feel new with Trump, however, is what she called his administration’s “negative narrative against our community in the messaging,” which she said is “really impacting immigrants throughout the region.”\n\nTODEC is not the only organization working to prepare for the impact of Trump's policies. Among others, local school districts and hospitals have worked to remind people, including their own employees, about the rights people have when immigration agents show up.\n\nTODEC not seeing major ICE raids so far\n\nPlans and promises to deport unauthorized immigrants have been central to Trump’s electoral appeals and political image since he began his first presidential run back in 2015, with both Trump's website and the official 2024 Republican Party platform promising “the largest deportation in American history.”\n\nTrump’s first days in office saw him sign a bevy of executive orders aimed at bolstering his ability to respond to what he has called an “invasion” of immigrants, while the new Congress passed a law empowering federal immigration officers to detain undocumented immigrants who are charged with certain crimes, including assault of a law enforcement officer, theft and burglary.\n\nBut despite those moves and the heightened fear among undocumented people that has been spurred by Trump’s rhetoric, Gallegos said her organization has so far seen neither large-scale immigration enforcement operations nor a discernible uptick in enforcement activity more generally.\n\nTODEC operates a hotline where people can report apparent immigration enforcement activities and has trained volunteers who investigate the reports.\n\nShe said her team has been receiving high numbers of calls, but their investigations have not found any enforcement actions. Instead, sometimes volunteers have responded to find roadside smog checks or other non-immigration activities. But most of the time they have not found anything happening at all.\n\nICE has continued to make targeted arrests in the area, but Gallegos said that has long been the case and called the current pace of such arrests “business as usual.”\n\nStill, Gallegos said her organization remains concerned a major escalation in enforcement could be coming and has tried to make that clear to the undocumented people it serves.\n\n\"We don't want to create more fear,” she said. “We have to be prepared for the worst, because it's happening (elsewhere). It might not be happening here yet, but it could potentially happen, you know?”\n\nTrump promises action on immigration, but picture is complicated\n\nWhile there has been much media attention paid to the subject of immigration in the wake of Trump’s second inauguration, it remains somewhat difficult to get a clear picture of whether enforcement levels have changed nationally — and if so, by how much.\n\nICE began posting daily data about the number of people it had arrested and lodged formal \"detainers\" against after the inauguration, but stopped in recent days. The number of daily arrests ranged from 286 per day to 1,179. Each day, ICE also filed between 373 and 869 detainers, which are formal requests to other law enforcement agencies to keep undocumented immigrants facing criminal charges in custody so ICE has time to come get them.\n\nICE has arrested around 130,000 people per year — about 356 per day — over the past eight years, according to agency data published by The New York Times last week.\n\nThe agency has not so far been posting daily deportation figures. But if Trump’s previous presidential term is any guide, it is not a foregone conclusion that his tough rhetoric will translate to a far greater number of deportations than other recent presidents.\n\nA November CNN story cited data provided by a Migrant Policy Institute analyst who said that around 1.5 million people were deported under Trump compared with the roughly 4.8 million under President Barack Obama and 1.49 million under President Joe Biden (whose term still had just over two months remaining at the time of the article’s publication). The analyst said those numbers do not include the large number of migrants turned away at the border in recent years.\n\nIn a recent speech to his supporters, Trump called immigration his “number one issue” and the key to his election win. That victory — in which he became the first Republican in 20 years to win both the electoral college and popular vote has naturally been read by many as confirming Americans support Trump's approach to immigration, or at least preferred it to Kamala Harris'.\n\nA set of recent Associated Press polls, however, found that Americans' views of deportations seem to be sensitive to how they are asked and what information they are presented.\n\nFor example, a majority of respondents said they would support \"deporting all immigrants living in the United States illegally\" but only about a third said they would support doing so if it meant separating children who are US citizens from their parents.\n\nTrump has also sent different messages at different times about whether his administration will focus on on deporting undocumented violent criminals — which the AP poll suggests is widely popular — or take a more sweeping and indiscriminate approach to deporting anyone in the country illegally.\n\nLocal lawyer sees signs of increased enforcement\n\nTODEC is also far from alone in attempting to prepare its staff and clients for a possible surge in immigration enforcement and the potential impacts it could have.\n\nA spokesperson for Eisenhower Health said a memo was sent to staff and posted online explaining that the medical provider does not collect information on any patient’s immigration status or report undocumented patients to federal immigration authorities.\n\nThe memo instructed that “physicians and staff should neither confirm nor deny the presence of a patient to a law enforcement officer or federal immigration official without a signed court order.”\n\nAnastacio De La Cruz, an Indio immigration and criminal defense attorney, said he is seeing signs of increasing enforcement activity locally, including anecdotal reports of more people getting arrested by ICE. He said clients have told him there now seem to be more ICE agents out on the streets.\n\n“They’re parked on the side of the freeways, down the street from schools,” he said.\n\nHe said ICE also seems to have broadened from a previous focus on arresting undocumented people with criminal convictions.\n\n“ICE was dedicating their resources to finding those people and removing those people, they were much less concerned about the gardener, who's been here 20 years without status, who was working to provide for his kids. But that has definitely shifted.”\n\nDe La Cruz said he is expecting those changes to result in more arrests, saying he had represented 10 people who were detained by immigration officers in the last four years and expects that number to rise to around 100 over the next four.\n\nHowever, he said he doubts the government has the resources to deport the millions of people that Trump has promised.\n\n“It’s just a numbers game,” he said, explaining that most undocumented people arrested by ICE in the US have a right to go through court proceedings that can take years.\n\nAs a result, De La Cruz advises that people should not necessarily live in fear but instead “hope for the best but prepare for the worst.” He explained that means having a plan in place for getting apprehended and recommended that people consult an attorney to develop such a plan.\n\n“Oftentimes, once they're picked up by ICE, if they haven't done anything to be proactive, there's not a lot that we can do at that point,” he said.\n\nPaul Albani-Burgio covers growth, development and business in the Coachella Valley.

He no longer considered Honduras his home. But he feared that wouldn’t matter in our Georgia town, its manicured lawns lined with “Make America Great Again” signs. If a cop pulled him over for any reason — or no reason at all — his tan skin and last name would be indictment enough.\n\n“This is the only country that I have,” my dad recently told me. “But people assume, because you’re an immigrant, that you somehow don’t belong here.”\n\nMy dad’s passport became a preemptive defense against our nation’s growing hostility toward immigrants. His fear wasn't unfounded.\n\nCertain hallmarks of Trump’s first administration — worksite raids, family separation, gutting the asylum system — offer a bleak preview into his agenda for a second term.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBut why worry if my father is a U.S. citizen? Why worry if, as some say, he came here “the right way?” The truth is that Trump’s immigration regime has the power to sweep up far more than undocumented immigrants.\n\n'Everyone became a target'\n\nFive days after his inauguration in 2017, Trump set out to massively expand the scope of immigration “enforcement priorities.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses these priorities to determine which undocumented immigrants to target. But the Trump administration broadened ICE’s enforcement priorities so greatly that “everyone became a target,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, told USA TODAY.\n\nWith limited resources, ICE has always been selective about who it targets for enforcement operations. Actual criminals who pose a danger to the public are the priority – not someone merely guilty of a civil immigration violation.\n\nChanging these priorities had an immediate impact on who was arrested during Trump’s first term. More and more people without any criminal history became victims of “so-called collateral arrests,” Reichlin-Melnick said.\n\n\"We can expect a return to collateral arrests under the second Trump administration, which happens when ICE goes after a specific target but ends up questioning and detaining everyone in the nearby vicinity.”\n\nMany of ICE’s operations take place in people’s homes. Even if ICE agents go in with a specific target in mind, Reichlin-Melnick said, “They might question that person’s spouse, children, and anyone else there and ask them for their papers. Even if those people have no criminal charges, they have the misfortune of being next to someone that does. So instead of just one person, the whole household gets arrested.”\n\nCollateral arrests rose significantly under Trump. ICE’s data shows that the agency made 110,568 arrests during 2017, a 42% increase from the previous fiscal year.\n\nBut that wasn’t because ICE was arresting more hardened criminals. Those arrests included undocumented immigrants who were only charged with a crime, not convicted. The majority of charges and convictions were for non-violent offenses, such as minor traffic violations or drug possession.\n\nAnother 10% of individuals arrested by ICE in 2017 had no pending criminal charges or convictions, but were categorized as “immigration violators.” These trends continued in 2018 and 2019, accounting for 13% and 14% of ICE's total arrests, respectively.\n\nThis approach has led to the deportation of American citizens. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that between fiscal years 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674, detained 121, and mistakenly deported 70 U.S. citizens.\n\nICE’s own statistics reveal an irony: by going after everyone, the Trump administration might make America less safe by diverting attention away from actual criminals.\n\n“This is the paradox of enforcement,” Reichlin-Melnick noted.\n\nMass deportations\n\nTrump campaigned on carrying out the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. He said he plans to begin these deportations on day one.\n\nThe economic toll would be enormous. The American Immigration Council estimates that deporting one million people per year would cost $88 billion annually. Removing all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States would take over a decade, with a total price tag of $967.9 billion.\n\nThe organization also predicts the U.S. GDP would shrink by 4.2% to 6.8%, a larger loss than the Great Recession of the mid-2000s.\n\nCertain key industries like construction and agriculture would also experience massive shockwaves.\n\nUndocumented immigrants make up an estimated 14% of the U.S. construction industry. Pulling that workforce would result in stalled construction across the nation, leaving houses, businesses, and basic infrastructure without vital labor. As industries buckle, U.S.-born workers would likely lose their jobs too.\n\nAmerica simply doesn’t have the population to fill the gaps either. Nearly 90% of undocumented immigrants are of working age, compared to 61.3% of U.S.-born workers. That divide will only grow as more Baby Boomers age out of the workforce.\n\nThere would be severe consequences at home too. In Augusta, Georgia, for example, immigrants make up nearly 29% of the agriculture industry. An estimated one out of eight are undocumented. If ICE removes those workers, agriculture in Augusta could be crippled.\n\nFear is the point\n\nWill the Trump administration be able to create such an immense deportation machine? It would be difficult.\n\nIn 2019, at the height of deportations under President Trump, ICE removed around 86,000 people from the interior of the country. That’s less than the 237,000 that former President Barack Obama deported in 2009, the highest number removed in a single year.\n\n“Even if Trump gets back to those Obama numbers, it would, at that rate, take 46 years to deport 11 million people,” Reichlin-Melnick explained. “That’s just the basic math.”\n\nBut just because the scale is improbable doesn’t mean the harm is any less real. Each number represents a person – someone ripped away from their home and community.\n\nAt the end of the day, whether Trump carries out mass deportations, he’s instilled fear into people’s minds. It’s the reason why my family has discussed moving out of Georgia, where people often equate skin color with immigration status.\n\nI asked my dad, now into his early seventies, what it would take for him to feel more at ease the next four years.\n\n“I just want to live the rest of my life in peace and quiet,” he said. “Somewhere I don’t have to worry about politics.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/29/ice-raids-in-austin-texas-immigration-immigrant-community-react-donald-trump/77970908007/", "title": "After first ICE detentions of Trump administration, Austin's immigrant ...", "text": "Dania Sandoval saw it happen several times over the last week: A client, always a young man, drove up to her Honduran food cart on Montopolis Boulevard, quickly ordered his food and immediately returned to his car.\n\nPerhaps, she reasoned to herself, it was the cold. But she suspected it was because of recent promises by President Donald Trump of mass deportations. On Sunday, one young man seemed to confirm her suspicions.\n\n“Have you seen immigration around here?” he asked her.\n\nSandoval told him she hadn’t. “You don’t have to be afraid,” she said.\n\nThat same day, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted an unknown number of apprehensions in undisclosed areas of Austin. They were part of what the agency described as “enhanced targeted enforcement,” targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal histories.\n\nThe operation further instilled a sense of dread and fear in Austin’s immigrant community that had set in fully after Trump’s inauguration and subsequent immigration-related executive orders.\n\n“We're seeing great concern and anxiety among the immigrant community because of the actions of ICE and others,” said Rebecca Lightsey, co-executive director of American Gateways, an Austin-based immigrant legal aid organization. “There's a great deal of fear.\"\n\nICE did not respond to several requests for comment from the American-Statesman inquiring about the scope of the agency’s recent or future operations in the Austin area.\n\nAn official with the Austin office of the Consulate General of Mexico told the Statesman the office had confirmed 12 Mexican citizens were detained as part of the weekend operation but was unaware if those persons had criminal histories.\n\nAustin Police Department Chief Lisa Davis said Sunday that federal officials had told her the operations targeted “wanted violent offenders,” but that she didn’t know how many federal warrants had been served either.\n\nICE isn’t receiving any help from Davis’ force, per city policy.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott announced plans to deploy a “tactical strike team” of state law enforcement officers across the state to “locate and arrest criminal illegal immigrants in the state” in conjunction with federal authorities. He claimed there were approximately 5,400 “illegal immigrants with active warrants from local jurisdictions across Texas.”\n\nNot the first time\n\nThe anxiety has reached far past Sandoval’s Montopolis food cart.\n\nOn Monday night, at least 100 people packed the pews of a Catholic church in eastern Travis County for a “Know Your Rights” session conducted in Spanish that featured advice from a lawyer and a psychologist.\n\n“Keep educating yourselves,” said Oskar Ponce, an activist with the organization that hosted the event, during the session. “Remember that fear shouldn’t follow us if we have the right knowledge.”\n\n“We are valuable to this country,” he added. “And we’ve shown it with our work and our efforts.”\n\nLocal immigration activist Carmen Zuvieta of the Austin Sanctuary Network said her nonprofit organization has likewise been “overwhelmed” by requests for help since Trump’s inauguration.\n\nThis isn't the first time ICE has conducted sweeping immigration operations in Austin.\n\nShortly after Trump’s first inauguration in 2017, ICE officials conducted several sweeps across the city that targeted dozens of people. Then, like now, the agency said it was targeting “convicted criminal aliens.”\n\nBut those operations resulted in the arrests of several immigrants who did not have criminal records, the Statesman reported at the time. A later review of agency emails by the Statesman found that officials “struggled to justify their claims that they had netted serious criminals in the Austin area.”\n\nA big drop in business\n\nAcross the parking lot from Sandoval’s food cart on Montopolis, Gloria Enriquez sat on a bench in the nutritional foods store owned by her friend, Rosa Licea.\n\nEnriquez, who owns the hair salon next door, was nervous. Sundays are usually her shop’s busiest day, with as many as five employees serving some 60 clients. This Sunday though, was “the slowest yet” since the November election.\n\n“I can’t say the same,” Licea said.\n\n“That’s because your clients are women, mine are young men,” Enriquez said.\n\nLicea and her employee, Carmen Vazquez, concurred: Men seemed to be more afraid that they will be stopped on the street than women do.\n\nSandoval’s business also is reliant on Latin American immigrant men for its customer base — about 9 in 10, she estimated.\n\nThe result, Sandoval said, has been a 50% to 60% drop in sales since the election.\n\nIf the slowdown continues, Sandoval fears it might force her to abandon the shop she saved up for two decades to open.\n\n“I knew once he (Trump) was elected this was going to hurt,” said Sandoval, who opened her food cart last February. “But if I’d have known this when I started my business, I wouldn’t have.”\n\nStatesman staff writer Bianca Moreno-Paz contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/morris-county/2025/02/12/morristown-nj-ice-arrest/78453027007/", "title": "ICE confirms two arrests in Morristown NJ, mayor urges calm", "text": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have confirmed the arrest of \"two illegal aliens\" in Morristown on Monday, two days after Mayor Tim Dougherty urged the town's immigrant population to \"be safe and be calm\" as rumors spread around town.\n\nA statement from the agency's field office in Newark, obtained Thursday by the Daily Record, said ICE agents made the arrests \"as part of daily routine immigration enforcement activities.\"\n\nThe statement gave no further information about those detained. \"As a matter of policy, and for the operational security of our officers and the public's safety, ICE does not comment on ongoing operations or announce or confirm future operations,\" it said.\n\nDougherty posted a video message on Facebook Tuesday, stating the arrests were \"an action that was not communicated to our Morristown Police Department or to our local government.\"\n\n\"We are still seeking information about the incident,\" the mayor stated in a Facebook post. \"The Morristown Police Department, like all other local and state law enforcement agencies, adheres to the directives established by the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office regarding immigration matters, which means that we do not assist ICE or participate in any immigration enforcement activities.\"\n\nThe arrest was another sign of ICE's increased activity in New Jersey, as part of President Donald Trump's promise to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Trump has repeatedly described the crackdown as targeting migrants accused of violent crimes. But immigrant advocates in the Garden State have complained that the raids are also sweeping up many who have no criminal records or are accused of minor charges.\n\n\"ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of aliens who pose the greatest threat to our communities, as well as those who have been ordered removed from the United States by an immigration judge,\" the Newark field office's statement reads. \"ICE additionally arrests aliens in the U.S. who are in violation of immigration law and aims to uphold the integrity of our immigration system while promoting the safety and security of our communities.\"\n\nICE arrest in Morristown: What happened\n\nDougherty told the Daily Record the arrest took place near the Abbett Avenue entry to the Staples store on Lafayette Street.

More than 470,000 New Jersey residents are undocumented. On the day of his inauguration, Trump declared a national border emergency and ordered the U.S. armed forces to repel \"forms of invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal migration and drug trafficking.\n\nThe executive orders he signed appeared to lay the groundwork for Trump's promised crackdown, including ending birthright citizenship for the children of some foreigners.\n\nFour days later, ICE agents raided a Newark business without a warrant. The agency arrested three undocumented immigrants but also \"detained folks that are citizens,\" according to Mayor Ras Baraka.\n\nBaraka, also a candidate for governor, called a press conference in which he said the Trump administration's orders \"threaten democracy and they threaten us individually.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/courts/2025/01/29/immigration-ohio-deportation-ice-trump-enforcement/77968924007/", "title": "Trump is upping immigration enforcement. What could that look like ...", "text": "Hours after being inaugurated for a second time, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders focused on immigration. These orders include providing additional federal agencies, such as the DEA and ATF, with the authority to make immigration arrests and deploy members of the U.S. military to the southern border.\n\nMilitary flights have also been used to deport migrants to other countries, including Colombia, according to reporting from USA TODAY. Social media exploded with rumors of ICE sightings across Columbus and other parts of the region. News outlets in northeast Ohio have reported small-scale raids on local businesses resulting in detainees being held in local jails.\n\nImmigration in Ohio:ICE raids in Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky? Here's what we've been able to confirm\n\nHere's what we know about how changes in immigration policy and the deportation process works in central Ohio.\n\nHave things changed since Donald Trump took office?\n\nJessica Rodriguez Bell, partner at Rodriguez Bell and DiFranco Law Office, has been handling immigration cases for more than 20 years.\n\nShe said there was an evident change in the first several days of Trump's second term, particularly in peoples' fear. Her office has been receiving more calls from people concerned about the impact the executive orders could have on them, even if they are legally in the country.\n\n\"People are definitely scared. There's an increased heightened awareness,\" Bell said. \"Even people with work permits and licenses are afraid to go out.\"\n\nBell said her office keeps cards in Spanish and English informing clients of their rights if they ever get questioned about their immigration status.\n\n\"We weren't even bothering with them the last four years, and now we've pulled them back out and started making new copies again,\" she said.\n\nBell said many of the clients contacting her office are from Central or South America, including countries like Mexico, Venezuela, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nHow will an increase in ICE activity be noticeable to the general public?\n\nIn 2024, under President Joe Biden, ICE arrested 113,431 people, or an average of 311 people a day.\n\nBell said there was very little noticeable street-level activity by ICE agents during the Biden administration. That, however, appeared to change in the early days of Trump's administration as the tough-on-immigration rhetoric and news of raids and mass arrests drew intense media attention across the country.\n\n\"There was strict enforcement with people with criminal convictions or arrest warrants,\" Bell said. \"They were not even pursuing old orders of deportation, really. Now, what we're hearing, we've heard some people say they've seen (ICE) outside their house.\"\n\nICE agents typically work in unmarked police vehicles and plain clothes, making it easy for rumors to spread, which in turn feed fears, Bell said.\n\nOn Jan. 23, a few days after Trump took office, ICE began posting daily arrest tallies on the social media site X. Between that day and Jan. 27, it reported 3,552 arrests – an average of 710 people a day, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.\n\nWhat are your rights if ICE shows up at your home?\n\nIf agents who say they are immigration officials show up at someone's home, a person is not obligated to open the door unless they have a search warrant signed by a judge who has the correct information.\n\nDeportation warrants are different than traditional criminal search warrants, Bell said. Even if agents have a deportation warrant, a person is not obligated to let agents into their home.\n\nOnly a properly written and signed judicial search warrant allows agents to enter a home with or without consent.\n\nBell said she and her colleagues encourage anyone visited by agents to demand the search warrant be slid under a door or held up to a window for verification. Their advice is to make sure the information is valid and that a judge has signed it before agreeing to open a door.\n\n\"If they even crack the door, (the agents) view that as being welcomed in and will come right through,\" Bell said.\n\nA detained person also has the right to speak to an attorney and to speak with the consulate for their native country, Bell said.\n\nFederal agents may not have all the information they need to file the proper paperwork, Bell said, and people may unknowingly provide that information by answering questions without first talking to an attorney. Bell said the language barrier has previously caused some clients to mistakenly sign their own deportation paperwork without understanding what it is they are signing.\n\nWhat happens after someone is detained?\n\nAnyone detained receives a Notice to Appear, which includes the allegations against them. In most cases, the person will be released from custody and given a date and time to appear in the Cleveland Immigration Court.\n\nIf a person is charged with a local crime, they would go through the criminal process before beginning the immigration process.\n\nThe immigration process would not involve any paperwork filed in Franklin County.\n\nThere generally does not appear to be a way to track case information online, as many other courts provide for the public. Case information for immigration courts is only available to track online by a specific case number.\n\nCourts can process immigration cases for people already in detention within several months, Bell said, because those cases get the court's priority. Other cases can take one to three years for people who are released.\n\n\"It used to be much worse,\" Bell said, with some court dates being scheduled up to five years in the future.\n\nWhat about people already in prison who may not be here legally?\n\nPeople who are already in prison after being convicted of crimes will serve their sentences before going through the deportation process, Bell said.\n\nImmigration officials can flag the person through internal systems and place a type of warrant called a \"holder\" on them. That warrant does not allow them to be released from custody to the public.\n\n\"Even if someone is arrested locally, they may get a bond in a local court, and they pay that bond but still don't get released because ICE has slapped a holder on them,\" Bell said.\n\nAfter someone finishes their sentence, they are immediately transferred into ICE's custody and start the immigration court process.\n\nThis process would be followed for people such as Gerson Fuentes, who is currently serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for at least 15 years. Fuentes pleaded guilty of the sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl that resulted in a pregnancy. The girl sought an abortion in Indiana and sparked a national conversation about abortion rights.\n\nFuentes is a Guatemalan national, according to court records.\n\nWhere are ICE detention facilities in Ohio?\n\nThere are currently two facilities in Ohio that house ICE detainees, according to information updated on the agency's website on Jan. 22: the Geauga County and Seneca County jails, both in northeastern Ohio.\n\nGeauga County Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand told Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC that his facility was holding 58 ICE detainees as of Tuesday.\n\nOther facilities have housed detainees, including the Butler County jail. Butler County canceled its contract with ICE in 2021, but Sheriff Richard Jones has indicated interest in reinstating it.\n\nIf someone is released pending their future immigration court hearings, they would likely be placed on a check-in schedule, Bell said. Those check-ins often take place at ICE's field office in Westerville.\n\nThat office is located at 675 Brooksedge Blvd.\n\nWhat about people seeking asylum?\n\nAsylum applications are also heard through the immigration court. The applications can only be filed by someone already in the United States and is not a citizen.\n\nAsylum is granted when someone can prove they have suffered or fear they would suffer persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group in their native country.\n\nWinning asylum cases can be difficult based on how the case law is written. According to Bell, Cleveland has a reputation as being stricter than other parts of the country, denying applications for asylum with the same evidence that had been used to grant asylum in a place like New York City or Miami.\n\n\"Most people coming to the U.S. from fear of cartels or gangs, that's not eligible for asylum the way the case law is written,\" she said.\n\nBell said if the federal government designates cartels as sponsors of terrorism, that could change how asylum seekers who fear gang or cartel violence have their applications reviewed.\n\nWho are the Cleveland immigration court judges?\n\nCurrently, 14 judges serve in the Cleveland Immigration Court.\n\nJudges go through an application process and then interviews before being appointed by the U.S. Attorney General.\n\nOf the 14 current judges, 11 were appointed under Trump's first administration. Biden appointed three during his term.\n\nSeveral judges worked for the Department of Homeland Security or ICE before becoming immigration court judges.\n\nCould the Laken Riley Act change things even more?\n\nThe Laken Riley Act — passed by Congress and expected to be signed by Trump — could provide additional changes on top of the executive orders.\n\nThe act would allow ICE to detain someone accused of a violent crime or theft offense, including shoplifting, before being convicted. Bell said the lack of due process in the criminal process is a concern.\n\n\"That act is very far-reaching, and they're saying that they're doing it in order to detain criminals, but that's something that under the law they should already be doing,\" Bell said. \"The fact that you can simply be accused and not convicted is a huge red flag and something everybody should be concerned about.\"\n\nAnother concerning aspect to Bell is rumors of a hotline being set up for people to report those they suspect of being in the country illegally.\n\n\"Does that mean that if you have a dispute with your Mexican neighbor, you can just call in and report them?\" Bell said. \"Someone could be accused and detained immediately and not even have the right to defend themselves.\"\n\nWill local police help ICE with immigration raids?\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther reiterated that following Trump's inauguration, Columbus police would not be involved in immigration enforcement, focusing solely on immigration status.\n\nThe Franklin County Sheriff's office said there have not been any changes to the department's \"role or responsibilities regarding immigration enforcement.\"\n\nThe Franklin County jails, which the sheriff's office oversees, do not house ICE detainees.\n\nOn Jan. 23, a Licking County Sheriff's deputy working on a drug enforcement task force pulled a vehicle over in Muskingum County, according to U.S. District Court records.\n\nCourt records say the task force received information from a Customs and Border Patrol agent about a vehicle from Arizona that was believed to be involved in alien smuggling. A license plate reader system on Interstate 70 captured that vehicle's license plate.\n\nThe deputy spotted the vehicle and followed it through Licking County and into Muskingum County, where it was pulled over for a traffic violation. Court records say the driver had $8,000 in cash and four people in the backseat who he said were his friends but did not know their names.\n\nThe driver has since been charged with transporting illegal aliens.\n\nLicking County Sheriff Randy Thorp said Monday his deputies assisted ICE and Border Patrol officers like any other agency that would ask for such help. The Licking County jail is not contracted to house ICE detainees.\n\nbbruner@gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/30/ice-hotlines-legal-advice-help-crackdown-nj-immigrants-trump/77978634007/", "title": "ICE hotlines, legal advice: Help with crackdown on NJ immigrants", "text": "Rev. Bolivar Flores stood in a Jersey City church on Thursday morning not to give a sermon but to relay the fear of people he knows in the aftermath of recent raids nationwide by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.\n\n\"This affects me when I hear, 'Pastor, I don't want to send my children to school,' or when I hear an old lady say to me, 'Reverend, can you go to the supermarket and bring food for me because I am scared to go the supermarket,\" Flores said. \"In 2025, in a free country of the United States.\"\n\nFlores, the vice president of the Latino Coalition of Pastors and Ministers of New Jersey, held a press conference at A Better Life Ministry. There, Flores, along with various religious and community leaders, as well as representatives of non-profit organizations and elected officials, spoke out about recent arrests of immigrants in New Jersey by ICE raids in the days following the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump as president — and laid out plans for how they're going to help.\n\nThose raids that have occurred nationwide — including one in Newark last week that provoked outrage when a U.S. military veteran was one of the people arrested even after showing his military ID — are part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes and his larger goal of mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nDuring the press conference, Flores announced that the coalition has set up a hotline — 551-255-5500 — for people to call for legal advice and emotional and spiritual guidance.\n\nNew Jersey is home to an estimated 475,000 undocumented immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center, and overall, 2.3 million immigrants, nearly a quarter of the state's population, according to government data.\n\nSpeaking out\n\nFlores was asked by a NorthJersey.com reporter if the coalition would take legal action against the Trump Administration regarding the ICE raids since the Department of Homeland Security rescinded a long-standing restriction on ICE officers entering locations like places of worship. He said there were no plans for a lawsuit as the coalition would focus on the hotline. Later, when asked if he was worried about such a raid coming into his church and if he would intercede, Flores said he would start \"praying,\" as he believes in a \"higher power\" protecting his church.\n\nPaterson Councilman Luis Velez interjected into the reporter's question by saying that authorities entering a church need to come with a warrant. Velez, in his comments, said that the current crackdown on immigrants by ICE is a repeat of President Trump's policies on immigration and deportation in his first term.\n\nRelated:What is a sanctuary city? Is NJ a sanctuary state? What limitations does ICE have?\n\nHe recalled back in 2017 when he drafted a resolution declaring Paterson a \"welcoming, inclusive, and immigrant-friendly\" city that continues to restrict local police cooperation in ICE enforcement only if they have a court order to arrest an individual.\n\nAsbury Park community organizer Felicia Simmons said everyone in the room should stand together against the federal government's immigration crackdown that would tear apart families.\n\n\"We are here for the children, for that lost generation or that forgotten, invisible child, that when their parents get deported, and they're here left alone because they are citizens,\" Simmons said.\n\nAlexandra Gonçalves Peña of the American Friends Service Committee’s Immigrant Rights Program, based in Newark, said the Trump Administration, in the 10 days since the inauguration, has \"leveled an immense amount of violence, emotional, psychological and physical\" to the immigrant community. She said the AFSC has set up a hotline — 973-474-9861 — to help immigrants detained by ICE.\n\nRicardo Kaulessar covers race, immigration, and culture for NorthJersey.com.

Down. Because people don’t want to go out,” he said.\n\nThe last two weeks included the ramp-up to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and swift action to crack down on immigration through raids across the nation and an executive order — temporarily blocked by a U.S. district judge — that would end automatic citizenship for children if neither their father nor mother is a citizen or a lawful permanent resident.\n\nWhile many of the raids have taken place in large cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, fear of similar action in Oklahoma City is palpable among the immigrant population, despite the Trump administration saying the operations target those with criminal histories.\n\nSome fear becoming “collateral damage,” that is being a longtime undocumented immigrant with no law-breaking history in the U.S. who is nonetheless swept up and arrested during operations against violent criminals.\n\nThe fear led to social media posts in January — which were quickly discredited — that claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles were located throughout south Oklahoma City near Interstate 240 and the Stockyards. Both areas have predominantly Hispanic populations.\n\nOn Tuesday in Oklahoma City, hundreds of Latino community members and allies gathered near the state Capitol as state schools Superintendent Ryan Walters and the Oklahoma State Board of Education unanimously approved a policy that would require schools to report the number of undocumented students in their districts.\n\nDemonstrators held signs that condemned Walters, Gov. Kevin Stitt, ICE and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nICE has not responded to an email inquiry about potential operations in Oklahoma City. Phone calls to its media line lead to a busy signal.\n\nThe agency reported more than 1,000 arrests across the nation Wednesday, as Beltran was starting a 12-hour shift in one of the three food trucks he operates in Oklahoma City.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of people scared,” he said. “I tell them ‘just work hard, don’t do nothing wrong.’”\n\n'I don't have answers'\n\nPastor Jose F. Mejia, of Fe Agrada A Dios, a south Oklahoma City congregation, lately has had as many questions about law enforcement as about faith in the Lord.\n\nHe shared some of those concerns during a break Tuesday from overseeing remodeling work at the church. An opened Bible rested on his office desk.\n\n“We had a meeting last night, we have a meeting once a year for all the churches to see what’s gonna be involved for this year, and that was a few questions they asked me — 'What are we gonna do in case immigration comes into their church?'” Mejia said. “And I said, ‘Believe me, I don’t have an answer for that because I don’t know.’ I don’t have answers.”\n\nUnder Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has rolled back protocol that stopped federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement at \"sensitive locations,\" such as schools and churches.\n\n“On Sunday morning there's a lot of people in here, and if they are looking for one person, are they gonna take them all?” Mejia said. “‘How are they gonna do it?’ is my question. With our congregation, the question is what can they do if they come to the church? What option can we have? They’re gonna come looking for the gentleman Number One. And there’s three or four people, they’re really good guys and they’re working but they don’t have papers, they're gonna take them away because it’s collateral damage?”\n\nSome questions are about local law enforcement’s involvement.\n\nLocal agencies told The Oklahoman they haven’t changed policy under the Trump administration.\n\n“There really isn’t anything for us to comment on at this point as nothing has changed in the way we do business,” said Oklahoma City Police Master Sgt. Gary Knight. “If there are changes down the road, we will be happy to discuss them at the appropriate time.”\n\nThe Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office offered similar remarks.\n\n“We really haven't gotten any direction one way or the other, so we really don't have anything to comment on,” spokesman Aaron Brilbeck said. “Obviously, depending on what the edicts are from the feds, we would have to possibly make changes to our policies. It might require additional training and finances, otherwise we don't really know what our role is going to be.”\n\nMejia said he came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1978 and became a citizen in 1995. While familiar with Bible passages like loving “the stranger who dwells among you,” Mejia cited New Testament verses about laws of the land.\n\n“The Bible says submit to the authorities,” he said. “And that’s my priority. Obey the authorities here in the United States. But I still know people, I still have people that they don’t have papers, no legal status in here. So I’m always going to be on their side to help them as much as I could.”\n\n'Everybody is fair game'\n\nThose deeply familiar with immigration policy told The Oklahoman that the level of enforcement is cyclical, and often depends on who is in office, as well as various policies across the country.\n\n“I think ICE has always, through the Obama administration, Trump’s first administration, they identify targets, people perhaps who have an arrest record, who have a criminal conviction or perhaps a prior deportation, and they target someone and they go and arrest them,” immigration attorney and state Sen. Michael Brooks-Jimenez, D-Oklahoma City, said. “I think one of the main differences is they've escalated the number of cases and targets they've identified.”\n\nThe Biden and first Trump administrations each conducted roughly 1.5 million deportations, including noncitizens removed from the interior and those returned at the border, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute based in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to the institute, both administrations recorded “significantly lower numbers than the 2.9 million deportations during the four fiscal years of President Barack Obama’s first term.”\n\nDeportations declined after Obama’s first term partly because sanctuary city policies limited local law enforcement agencies’ cooperation with federal efforts, according to the Institute.\n\nAna Pottratz Acosta, a professor who specializes in immigration law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota, said the key difference between the Biden and Obama administrations and Trump’s first term was how prosecutorial discretion was used.\n\nUnder Biden and Obama, prosecutorial discretion gave more leeway to consider individual circumstances in removal cases.\n\nAcosta said in addition to exercising prosecutorial discretion to not go after longtime undocumented immigrants with no criminal record, immigration court prosecutors under Biden would not oppose the dismissal of pending cases where the person had a path to legalize their status.\n\nThe Biden administration also used its humanitarian parole authority to create lawful pathways for people to come to the U.S. to seek asylum or enter on a humanitarian basis if they were from a specific country experiencing civil or political unrest, or war, Acosta said.\n\n“Prosecutorial discretion makes a lot of sense because obviously you're working with agencies that have a finite number of dollars and resources, and you want to make sure you are effectively using those resources,” Acosta said. “You have to target people at the top of the list. What you see now is everybody is fair game for placement in removal proceedings under Trump.”\n\nAcosta said another difference between the administrations is the impact rhetoric has on immigrant communities.\n\n“There seems to be an orchestrated campaign of fear,” Acosta said. “And for the immigrant community, there are concerns that any time I leave my house or get in my car, it can lead to me being stopped and shipped out of the country.”\n\nAt the same time, there is support for Trump’s actions among the immigrant community, including in the Rev. Mejia’s congregation.\n\n“There was a lot of people — criminals, terrorists and all this stuff,” Mejia said. “That’s one of things that I think that forced Donald Trump to act like that. Because otherwise, how are they gonna pull all the people out? But in the same way, there is some good people. I know people here — they’ve been here for 20 years. They have paid houses off already, got good work, they own companies. They don’t have no papers. If they take these people, what are they gonna do with them?”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/oklahoma-city/2025/01/24/ice-in-oklahoma-city-stoke-fears-what-to-know-immigration-raids/77904427007/", "title": "Posts about ICE, immigration raids in Oklahoma City, metros stoke ...", "text": "Social media posts have stoked local fears of mass raids and deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal law enforcement agency better known as ICE.

Both areas have predominantly Hispanic populations, and the post encouraged people to “please check on your friends and loved ones.”\n\nBut immigration attorney and state Sen. Michael Brooks-Jimenez, D-Oklahoma City, told The Oklahoman that the alleged reports were false. He said his legal office had not received any calls about ICE presence in south OKC or elsewhere in the city.\n\n“I think that people’s anxiety is rising now that the inauguration has happened and now that President (Donald) Trump has taken office, and so naturally, I think people are concerned about the change in strategy when it comes to immigration enforcement,\" Brooks-Jimenez said. \"It’s unfortunate with social media right now that there’s bad or incorrect information that’s being put out to a community that’s already on edge.”\n\nWhat are community leaders saying?\n\nBrooks-Jimenez said that, while people are \"rightfully worried\" about recent changes in approaches to immigration policy, it was important to remain calm. In his past 25 years as an immigration attorney, Brooks-Jimenez said he'd seen this type of panic before — when Trump was previously in the Oval Office and rumors were spread about ICE activity in certain parts of the city.\n\nBut upon further investigation, the senator said, every report about alleged ICE activity would amount to nothing more than \"just a rumor.\"\n\n\"In each case investigated, it was traffic arrests or sobriety checkpoints,\" Brooks-Jimenez also said in a statement posted to social media. \"Although ICE Fugitive Operations occasionally make arrests targeting specific individuals, these operations are infrequent.\"\n\nRelated:State senator wants Oklahoma's Latino voices to be heard in community, politics\n\nSouth OKC Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, also told The Oklahoman that, despite some social media posts, \"there is no credible report\" that ICE was arresting people without documentation in the city.\n\n\"Although this is a serious situation, it is important to avoid causing unnecessary panic,\" Jimenez-Brooks said. \"I ask everyone in our community to work together responsibly to face these difficult times.\"\n\nWhat's happening nationally that has immigrant communities, advocates concerned?\n\nPresident Trump's executive orders, shortly after his inauguration this week, included authorization of federal authorities to conduct immigration arrests on school campuses. He's also signed a controversial decree to end birthright citizenship and promised to target immigrants with criminal records as he launches a \"mass deportation\" to remove millions of people from the country.\n\nOfficials in major U.S. cities friendly to migrants, including Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis, said they expected major ICE raids of immigrant communities. Trump's designated border czar, Tom Homan, also told Fox News earlier this week that ICE had already conducted 308 arrests across the country. In comparison, NBC News reports, ICE arrested 282 migrants per day in September 2024, the latest month for which data is available.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday it was ending a President Barack Obama-era policy restricting ICE agents ability to arrest undocumented people at or near \"sensitive\" locations, including schools, hospitals and houses of worship.\n\nMore:Vast majority of speakers at hearings oppose Ryan Walters' administrative rules proposals\n\nWhat advice are OKC leaders giving community members for the future?\n\nWhen Tasneem Al-Michael, a local community activist known for his advocacy with various organizations, first saw the social media post about ICE activity in south OKC, he became concerned and re-shared it on his own account immediately. But soon after learning from friends in the OKC council for the League of United Latin American Citizens that the social media post wasn't true, he deleted the update and acknowledged his mistake.\n\n\"Our gut reaction is to amplify what we see,\" Al-Michael said, \"but I’m having to remind myself that I’m having to ‘trust, but verify,’ before somebody like myself goes and shares something and a lot of people can also start to feel erratic or panicked by the circumstance.\"\n\nJimenez-Brooks is also encouraging the public to \"not presume that everything you read on social media\" is true. But for those who may still be concerned about possibly being taken into immigration custody, the senator didn't want to dismiss the anxieties they felt but also believed that \"the chances are fairly remote that that would happen anytime soon.\"\n\nHowever, he also said that making a plan would be appropriate \"in case something does happen,\" and that concerned individuals should have a designated person with power of attorney over their property or to take care of their children.\n\nNumerous organizations are planning to hold forums in the coming days to educate people on their constitutional rights.

That's part of Trump's request of $18 billion over 10 years to build additional walls and fences along the border. The 2019 money would be used entirely in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the easternmost border sector that has seen the highest number of undocumented immigrants crossing into the U.S.\n\nThe budget would also provide 22% increases in funding for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the agency responsible for patrolling the southern border and all ports of entry, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency responsible for immigration enforcement in the rest of the country.\n\nThat increase would fund 750 new agents for CBP, a mixture of customs agents who work at seaports, airports, and land ports, and Border Patrol officers who monitor all the border regions in between. The number of undocumented immigrants crossing into the U.S. reached historic lows in the months immediately following Trump's inauguration, but they increased for eight straight months are are back in line with illegal immigration patterns of the past decade.\n\nThe new money would also allow ICE to hire 2,000 new agents to help arrest more undocumented immigrants living in the interior of the U.S. That agency has ramped up immigration arrests by about 30% in Trump's first year in office, in part by arresting more undocumented immigrants who don't have a criminal record.\n\nWhile arrests of undocumented immigrants have increased under Trump, deportations have dropped, partly due to a growing backlog of 650,000 deportation cases that are swamping the nation's immigration judges. Trump's budget tries to address that problem by providing $40 million to hire 75 new immigration judge teams, and another $40 million to hire 338 new federal attorneys to prosecute those cases.\n\nAnd then there's the question of housing them. ICE has the capacity to house about 51,000 immigrants a day in federal detention centers and local jails that house immigrants on behalf of ICE. The 2019 budget adds about 800 new beds in immigration facilities, but does not make clear whether the administration will follow through on attempts to build new immigration prisons.\n\nIn October, ICE issued a proposal to identify locations to build new immigration prisons in Chicago, Detroit, St. Paul, and Salt Lake City. But it was unclear whether any of the money requested in the 2019 budget could be used to build those prisons.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/12"}]}

Eight million daily trips are made to and from the district, including cars, public transit and bicycles, according the environmental assessment.\n\nThe congestion pricing model has worked in other global cities, like Stockholm, London and Singapore, according to the transit authority's data. If it goes into effect, New York would have the country's first congestion pricing program.\n\nThe MTA's report showed seven scenarios of the program's possible impacts on traffic, pollution and tolling. The scenarios included varying credit options for tolls already paid at crossings and exemptions of certain types of vehicles, like buses, and what would happen if the agency did not implement congestion pricing.\n\nTolls to enter Manhattan's Central Business District could range from $9 to $23 during peak hours, $7 to $17 during off-peak hours or $5 to $12 overnight, models showed.\n\nThose would be in addition to tolls paid at other crossings into midtown Manhattan, like the Lincoln Tunnel, Holland Tunnel and George Washington Bridge, where tolls range from $11.75 to $16 for cars.\n\nWILL THEY CONTINUE TO FALL?:Gas prices drop under $4 nationwide for first time in months\n\nCONSUMER PRICE INDEX REPORT:Inflation comes off 40-year high, but stays elevated at 8.5% as gas prices fall\n\nIts authors predict all congestion pricing scenarios would lead to reduced traffic and increased transit ridership into midtown Manhattan — which are the program's ultimate goals, along with raising $1 billion annually for the MTA's capital fund to improve subways and buses.\n\n\"The assessment found that 85% of existing work trips to the Central Business District are made by transit, 5% by car from New York City, 3% by car from New York suburban counties, 3% by car from New Jersey, 0.2% by car from Connecticut, and 4% by other modes, including taxis, for-hire vehicles, bicycling and walking,\" according to a MTA press release. \"With initiation of the program, the number of vehicles entering the CBD would decline by 15.4% to 19.9%, depending on the tolling scenario.\"\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration is expected to issue a decision on the environmental review in January 2023. If the agency finds no significant impacts, the Toll Mobility Review Board will have 310 days to issue recommendations on how the tolling structure and exemptions should work and which crossings should receive credits. The infrastructure needed to process the tolls would also need to be put in place.\n\nFive of the toll board's six appointments were announced earlier this month. Calls were made to give neighboring New Jersey, which doesn't have board representation, more input on the plan during public hearings last year.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he would not support a congestion pricing tolling program that does not give credit to New Jersey drivers at all three Hudson River crossings.\n\n\"We love it conceptually,\" Murphy said about congestion pricing, but, he added, \"There is no way, no how that will happen with a double taxation on New Jersey commuters.

Kathy Hochul and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy rubbed shoulders at a Regional Plan Association event where they discussed their partnership on transportation issues.\n\nThe tolling plan, which the two governors don't agree on, would charge New Jersey drivers more to enter Manhattan. It was not mentioned at the event — and Murphy is now \"closely assessing\" legal options over the decision.\n\nThe New Jersey governor called the decision \"unfair,\" \"ill-advised\" and a \"money grab,\" in a statement released Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Since Day One, I’ve stood against the disproportionate negative impacts of congestion pricing on New Jerseyans – a greater financial burden on New Jersey commuters, double tolling, toll shopping, a lack of revenue for NJ Transit, outsized environmental burdens on certain North Jersey communities, and financial impacts on the Port Authority’s capital budget,\" Murphy's statement read.\n\n\"As a conceptual matter, I support congestion pricing, but it must be structured in a way that is fair to all sides. UntiI New York’s congestion pricing plan is fixed, I will keep working closely with partners from both states and both sides of the aisle, including Congressman (Josh) Gottheimer and our congressional delegation, to halt implementation of this misguided tolling plan. Our administration is closely assessing all legal options.”\n\nMurphy has in the past threatened to veto Port Authority of New York and New Jersey minutes over the matter.\n\nThe FHWA’s decision about the plan — which could charge drivers as much as $23 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street — was announced about four months after a decision was expected.\n\nThis will be the first congestion pricing program in the country, following other countries, like Singapore and Sweden.\n\n\"Congestion pricing is a generational opportunity to make it easier for people to get around in, and get to, the Central Business District, by reducing traffic and funding improvements to the public transit system,\" said John J. McCarthy, the MTA's chief of external relations. \"To do it right, environmental equity has been an integral component. We are grateful that the FHWA has acknowledged the Project Sponsors’ efforts to date and has found the document has met the standards for legal sufficiency.\"\n\nEarlier this week, seven members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation penned a letter to Hochul calling on her to cancel the plan. They urged her to “come to the table with Gov. Phil Murphy and NJ Transit to develop new plans to reinvest in affordable public transit options in our region.”\n\nGottheimer, the most vocal New Jersey elected official against the plan, told reporters on a call Friday afternoon he found the decision “completely outrageous.”\n\n“For folks who are struggling to make ends meet, this is a devastating blow,” he said. “Every single nickel that the MTA will literally pilfer at the pockets of Jersey families will go to the MTA.”\n\nThe seven members of Congress argue that New Jersey commuters who go into Manhattan already contribute a great number of dollars to New York’s economy through income tax and hefty tolls on the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and George Washington Bridge, crossings operated by a bistate agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe MTA would use the money generated from the tolling program to fund its capital plan to improve subways and buses, while also reducing pollution and congestion in the most trafficked part of the region. Last year, the agency released a 4,000-page environmental assessment that provided seven scenarios outlining different ways to charge vehicles and weighing whether some vehicles should be credited, like buses or those that use crossings that already have tolls, like the Lincoln and Holland tunnels.\n\nAmong the reasons New Jerseyans have taken issue with this is because they were largely kept out of the agency’s planning for the toll program and because none of the money would be used to improve New Jersey’s public transportation network, which could see more riders if people choose to avoid the extra toll.\n\nLast year, Murphy called on the U.S. Department of Transportation to require the agency to do a more thorough environmental review and slow down the approval process for the plan.\n\nMurphy has also noted in the past that the tolling program could have severe consequences without capacity improvements at New York Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main portals for the vast majority of New Jersey commuters who already use public transportation to get to Manhattan. Improvement plans are underway at both facilities, but years away from completion.\n\nThe FHWA, in its letter to the MTA, said its environmental review “mitigates the adverse effects from the preferred alternative” and must allow 30 days for public review. After that, a toll board will be assembled – which does not include representatives from New Jersey – that will decide how the tolling program will work, what vehicles and crossings (if any) get credited or exempt, and when the program would go into effect.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/12/21/tdot-plan-funds-new-i-40-exit-other-east-tennessee-road-projects/71982688007/", "title": "TDOT plan funds new I-40 exit, other East Tennessee road projects", "text": "East Tennessee might not be getting the state's first toll lane, but some major transportation projects are on the horizon for the region.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Transportation released an updated 10-year funding plan for the whole state.

And if a fire does start, emergency managers may be left without a way to warn residents in time.\n\nThose were some of the concerns counties listed Wednesday when the California Public Utilities Commission asked for feedback on programs to de-energize lines to stave off a wildfire.\n\nPre-emptive shut-offs have real impacts to public safety, from medical care to safe drinking water, said Robert Lewin, director of Santa Barbara County’s Office of Emergency Management. They cannot be a long-term fix to preventing fires.\n\n“We don’t design a high-rise building in a city so every time it’s windy, we’re going to evacuate it,” Lewin said at the meeting in Calabasas. “We design it so it will withstand the winds of that community.”\n\nUtilities need to be designed the same way – to withstand the environments they are in, he said.\n\n“I know it will take time, but we cannot think of ourselves 10 years from now or 20 years from now still turning off the power during a red-flag type of event.”\n\nMORE:Fire chief: Edison plan to cut power raises ‘significant concerns’\n\nThe commission late last year opened a rule-making process to look at whether to add or change requirements of companies like Southern California Edison and PG&E when it comes to de-energizing lines.\n\nState law gives the utilities the authority to turn off power for safety reasons. More recently, however, companies developed programs to exercise that authority to try to prevent lines from sparking a blaze.\n\nDubbed the Public Safety Power Shutoff, the program is designed to de-energize lines during high winds and dry conditions to prevent problems.\n\nUtilities blamed for fires\n\nMalfunctioning electrical equipment in gusty conditions can and has sparked fires, including a dozen in Northern California in 2017.\n\nWhile an official cause of last year’s Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has yet to be released, some local residents have blamed Edison equipment in a flurry of lawsuits.\n\nEdison has said it will only preemptively shut off power after its weather specialists identify dangerous conditions and a crew confirms a problem from the field. Over its entire 50,000-square-mile service area, Edison anticipates a shut-off could take place two to 10 times a year.\n\nThe shut-offs focus on areas with an elevated fire risk, called Tier 2 and Tier 3, as identified in a map published by the commission. Those spots make up about a quarter of Edison’s service area, including much of eastern and northern Ventura County.\n\nMORE:130,000 residents notified of possible power shut-off as Santa Anas blew\n\nWho pays?\n\nOn Wednesday, officials worried that agencies don’t have the capacity to keep backup generators going for a day or longer and at every spot where a power shut-off could occur. That could affect agencies responsible for providing drinking water or cellphone providers keeping towers operating.\n\nManaging a power shut-off costs money, officials said, from adding backup power supplies to bringing on more staff to prevent looting or an influx of 911 calls.\n\n“The Public Safety Power Shutoff program is an effort to reduce wildland fire exposure. We all admit that. We all understand that,” said Donna Boston, director of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department emergency management division.\n\n“It does equal a reduction in liability with a shareholder benefit,” she said. “There is a cost somewhere that someone is crunching numbers and there is benefit for their shareholders.”\n\nBut there also is a real cost to public safety agencies, she said. “Money needs to be set aside for mitigating that risk.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nOn Wednesday, sheriff’s Lt. Jim Byers of El Dorado County said he got a lot of information from PG&E before the first shut-off in his county.\n\nBut the actual event was far from seamless.\n\n“After eight months of meetings with PG&E, we were given a very clear set of guidelines of what the trigger point would be for activations,” said Byers, director of the county’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nThe day they shut off power, he said, “we, in the field, were not seeing any of these conditions at all.”\n\nNotifications also fell short, he said.\n\n“We only have a few traffic signals, but they control the main highway,” he said. When the power went out, the backup system to those signals died within a couple hours and “basically gridlocked our county.”\n\n“If we had experienced a fire on either side of those traffic signals … we would have never been able to get fire equipment to the fires.”\n\nKevin McGowan, manager of Ventura County’s Office of Emergency Services, said discussions need to happen about ways to quickly bring power back on in an emergency.\n\nCurrently, he said, the process doesn’t allow for rapid re-energization.\n\n“We’ve introduced that topic with Southern California Edison and we’re in that discussion, but it’s something that is of the utmost importance to us right now,” he said. “We’re just a couple months away from fire season again.”\n\nTo get involved\n\nAnyone interested in participating in the rule-making can contact the commission’s public adviser to find out how to do so at 415-703-2074 or 866-849-8390 or public.advisor@cpuc.ca.gov.\n\nFor more information, go to http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/deenergization.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/military/blueangels/2022/07/06/blue-angels-pensacola-beach-2022-what-you-need-know-thursday/7824213001/", "title": "Blue Angels Pensacola Beach Air Show 2022 week: What you need ...", "text": "Pensacola News Journal\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe week leading up to the Blue Angels Pensacola Beach Air Show is always a fun one, full of meet and greets, flyovers and ample opportunity to see the demonstration team in action.\n\nBreakfast with the Blues officially kicked off the events Wednesday as fans headed to Pensacola Beach to watch the Blue Angels markthe show’s coordinates and center points along Pensacola Beach.\n\nHere's what's in store for the rest of the week:\n\nPreviously:Blue Angels 2022 practice schedule in Pensacola\n\nBlue Angels Air Show at Pensacola Beach: Tips to shoot the best photos\n\nTop 5 things to do:Blue Angels weekend, Inferno Burlesque and more\n\nSuper Hornet info\n\nIn 2021, the Blue Angels debuted their new Super Hornets jets.

Local residents, skeptical after decades of shelved \"301 Relief Route\" plans, worry that truck drivers will avoid the long-planned highway between Middletown and the Del. 1 Roth Bridge and speed down local roads at all hours.\n\nIf that happens, it would undermine state expectations that trucks will provide 55 percent of the new road's revenues through those tolls, though they are expected to make up only about 18 percent of traffic.\n\nConcerns about toll-bypassing are high enough that the state Department of Transportation plans to renew talks with Maryland officials about road restrictions and a potential road closing to shut off easily accessed, free alternative routes to the new 301.\n\nAt stake is the state's funding plan, as well as the safety and frayed nerves of motorists who use the existing, narrow and often-jammed parts of Delaware's current 301 corridor.\n\n\"It's horrible out there. From 4 to 8 every night, it's bumper to bumper, cars and trucks. A lot of trucks,\" said Virginia Batzel, who has lived along the two-lane Summit Bridge Road section of U.S. 301 for 20 years. \"It seems like they did time the traffic lights to help, but you only have about two seconds to get out when there's any time at all.\"\n\nThe project would create a four-lane, toll road connector between Maryland 301 southwest of Middletown and the Del. 1 Roth Bridge – eliminating the last two-lane, slower-moving sections of 301 between Richmond, Virginia and Wilmington.\n\nHighway officials have been working to improve traffic on the corridor since the 1960s, and actively studying a relocation onto a new four-lane corridor since the late 1980s. Millions have gone into studies and rights-of-way for shelved options, and debates have raged over location choices and land deals that added millions to the cost.\n\nDelDOT officials say they hope to make an announcement in a few weeks on financing arrangements for relocation of 301 onto a new four-lane toll highway. They also said truck traffic and toll-bypassing will get renewed attention then if federal officials approve the last, crucial funding link. Construction could begin as early as the coming spring.\n\nThe upcoming announcement would focus on a long-sought, $185 million loan guarantee from a Federal Highway Administration program that assists regionally important transportation projects.\n\n\"If there's a way around the tolls, the trucks will find it,\" said Charles Mulholland, president of the Southern New Castle Civic Alliance. \"Every time I come over the (Del. 1) Roth Bridge going south, I follow a caravan of trucks going off on the ramp\" that lets motorists avoid toll booths.\n\nHundreds of trucks every hour\n\nWell north of Middletown, in a subdivision near the Del. 896-U.S. 13 Boyds Corner intersection, longtime resident Robert Mooney said relief can't come soon enough.\n\n\"Sometimes they back up at the light, and there are so many trucks waiting that the line comes all the way back to my house,\" said Mooney, whose property is several hundred yards away. \"It gets pretty loud, and traffic seems to increase at night, because of the way they travel, maybe.\"\n\nAt the end of the Grande View Farms cul-de-sac where Mooney lives, the upper half of trucks can be seen above a neighbor's backyard fence, rumbling past in both directions just a few yards beyond every few minutes, or even seconds.\n\nA traffic and revenue forecast released by DelDOT in May indicated that 200 to 225 trucks an hour travel U.S. 301 west of Middletown for several daylight hours every weekday during the summer, with at least 100 per hour for 18 hours a day.\n\nAnticipated truck traffic and toll-bypassing for the new 301 \"was a major focus\" of talks among Maryland and Delaware officials in 2006, before funding uncertainties left the project in limbo, DelDOT officials said last week.\n\nStakes are high financially. A state consultant reported that 8 percent of projected revenues from the new toll road relied on an overall plan that included closing Sassafras Road north of Maryland 299, nearly two miles inside Maryland, to make toll avoidance harder.\n\nDelDOT spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said the agency is no stranger to the business of chasing toll road strays.\n\n\"I think we would go at it the same way we try to push traffic to I-95 and get them off the streets of Newark,\" Sundstrom said.\n\nLate last year, DelDOT invested in extra police patrols after noticing a significant decline in collections from trucks passing through the I-95 Newark barrier. Newark and Delaware State Police officers spent months running down trucks that slipped off the interstate and onto local roadways. Many of the roads have weight limits or other restrictions prohibiting trucks.\n\n\"That's essentially illegal,\" Sundstrom said, noting that the resulting uptick in toll receipts had offset the enforcement expense, recently estimated at about $67,000.\n\nFirst new toll lanes since 2003\n\nDelaware's part of the existing 301 includes the only two-lane sections of the federal highway between Richmond and Wilmington, a feature that has become more vexing as drivers, especially truck drivers, turned to the road to avoid congestion and tolls along I-95 between the same two cities.\n\nTalks on relocating all or part of U.S. 301 have percolated on and off for nearly 50 years, with an environmental impact study in the early 1990s settling on a more-or-less north-south route, long since abandoned, that would have connected Summit Bridge with U.S. 301 in Maryland, southwest of Middletown.\n\nState officials have consistently said that safety concerns and heavy truck traffic justify the expense and effort of relocating and widening 301.\n\nThe rate of traffic fatalities along the road was 60 percent higher than the national average during the last decade. Earlier this month, a motorist lost his life along the highway, on one of the road's narrower stretches, after swerving into oncoming traffic.\n\n\"This road has always been busy,\" said Rick Logullo, a Middletown native whose family has operated Logullo's Garden Center along U.S. 301 for 25 years. \"Sometimes it feel like it takes me longer to get from Route 1 to my store than it does to go from Lewes to Middletown.\"\n\nStarting tolls at Delaware's mainline would be set at $4 for cars and $11 for trucks, but would begin a long series of increases starting in 2021, when the rate would rise by $1 for cars and $3 for trucks. Smaller fees would be charged for partial use of the toll road via three interchanges in Delaware.\n\nIt would be the first toll lanes opened since 2003, when DelDOT completed the last leg of the Del. 1 highway between I-95 and Dover, originally dubbed the U.S. 13 Relief Route.\n\nAlthough the opening of the Amazon fulfillment center and new Johnson Controls distribution hub in Middletown have contributed to truck volume, Logullo said big rigs have rumbled through the area in large numbers for years.\n\n\"I think the bypass is going to be a positive, especially for the local people,\" Logullo said as he watered plants and talked over the regular roar of passing trucks. \"You're still going to have to have local traffic, but you're going to take [away] a lot of this truck traffic.\"\n\nLarry Tarabicos, a land use attorney who represents developers of the huge Town of Whitehall planned community south of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, said the new highway would give a boost to southern New Castle development. A portion of the Whitehall plan, the proposed Scott Run Business Park, would rely heavily on access to 301 at the toll road's northernmost interchange.\n\nEconomic downturn changed plans\n\nCosts and community objections along new corridors blocked earlier route proposals, or kept them on the back burner until DelDOT started all over. Then, in 2007, a new environmental study endorsed an entirely new corridor that would take traffic diagonally across southern New Castle County between the Del. 1 Roth Bridge and southwest Middletown.\n\nThe economic downturn dealt a major blow to the project just as DelDOT was lining up plans to sell bonds and start construction.\n\nA consultant reported in 2013 that long-term changes in the economy and travel habits signaled a nearly 60 percent cut in opening year revenue estimates for the new highway. Traffic on the road 40 years out, projected to eventually hit 41,000 vehicles daily as recently as 2010, were slashed. Current projections call for only 17,400 vehicles per day in 2060.\n\nForecasts dropped sharply enough that lawmakers had to approve the use of Transportation Trust Fund revenues to cover early year revenue shortfalls. Tolls were originally seen as covering all costs from day one.\n\n\"I've read so much over the last few years about what they're going to do and when they're going to do it, but it doesn't happen, so I kind of stopped paying attention,\" said Christine Whaley, who lives along Cedar Lane just north of Del. 896/Boyds Corner Road.\n\n\"It would be nice if they would take trucks off 896. I see them going down this road all the time to get around the tolls that are there already\" between Washington D.C. and Delaware.\n\nDrivers routinely take Del. 896, or Boyds Corner Road, to reach Del. 1 and a connection to I-95 via the non-tolled ramps just south of the Roth Bridge.\n\nDelaware residents already have spent heavily for the latest round of the project.\n\nDelDOT borrowed $125 million to get the project rolling, spending some $95 million to buy needed rights-of-way and the rest on engineering, design and utility relocations. The agency has started paying that loan back, using funds from the state's annual federal highway aid allocation.\n\nAt the U.S. 301 Plaza truck stop near the Maryland line, truck drivers asked about the prospect of paying to use the currently free road were guarded.\n\n\"If it's a toll road, it will affect us a little bit. This is a cheaper route to go,\" said Leon Peterson, a truck driver from Clinton, North Carolina, who travels 301 every other day. \"We might have to find another route.\"\n\nMarilyn Wright, a longtime resident along Churchtown Road just west of the busy U.S. 301-Del. 896 Mount Pleasant intersection, said she and some neighbors do their own bypassing when traffic backs up along the truck-heavy crossroads.\n\n\"We go around it, by Choptank Road, and bypass everything. We all say we're going the back way,\" Wright said, referring to a two-lane road that runs north-south through farm and – increasingly – residential areas between Middletown and Mount Pleasant.\n\nBut the planned new highway will pass close to some relatively new developments near Choptank, especially around Middletown, Wright said.\n\n\"Of course, now that they've let it get built up, that's going to become a problem for many people\" who live near the planned new highway, Wright said.\n\n'Not going to pay unless they have to'\n\nIn 2006, Maryland and Delaware officials both acknowledged worries that the new toll road would send cost-conscious drivers onto side roads before they ever crossed the state line.\n\nMeetings were held in Cecilton, Maryland, southwest of Middletown, to map out strategies for corralling the strays.\n\nBonny Anderson of Warwick, Maryland, reported \"major concerns regarding traffic on MD 213,\" but was told neither the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal bridge nor the MD 213 bridge over the Sassafras River had weight limits.\n\nTentatively approved plans called for closing an easy connection via Sassafras Road in Maryland to Del. 299, a link that would route motorists around the mainline toll plaza and back onto the current 301 corridor.\n\nBans on all but local 18-wheeler traffic were recommended for key two-lane road links in Delaware to other toll-avoiding routes, including Levels Road, Green Giant Road, Bunker Hill Road, Lloyd Guessford Road, Ebeneezer Church Road and Warwick Road. Large numbers of local routes already have weight or other restrictions likely to complicate bypasses.\n\nMark Tudor, DelDOT's project engineer, said more talks on road closings or other Maryland changes would be required, but \"additional detailed discussions on this issue have not occurred\" since 2006.\n\nLee Bliffen, owner of Lan-Chester Sheds and Gazebos along Summit Bridge Road, had mixed feelings about DelDOT's plans.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, yes,\" Bliffen said when asked if he noticed truck traffic and congestion. \"You'll start seeing traffic back up at the light down here, from Marl Pit [Road], and they'll back up past here to try to get through the light. From 3:30 on through 6 o'clock, this place is mad.\"\n\nBliffen also said he was looking for a new location for his business, which has seen a boom as residential development has picked up steam across southern New Castle County.\n\n\"If I stay here I'm going to lose business, because it's going to take a lot of traffic off 301 and put it on the bypass.\"\n\nEdward Bullock, who lives in the Spring Mill community off 301 north of Middletown, said he worries that trucks will stay even as businesses go.\n\n\"I think the real frustration is going to be if they put in a toll road, unless you force them to use it, they're going to find a way around,\" Bullock. \"They're not going to pay unless they have to.\"\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at (302) 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/local/2020/02/26/new-toll-roads-needed-create-jobs-reduce-congestion-florida-supporters-say/4691233002/", "title": "New toll roads needed to create jobs, reduce congestion in Florida ...", "text": "Three new toll roads in Florida will create jobs.\n\nThat much is clear — but the rest isn't when it comes to figuring out how the roads might benefit — or possibly hurt — the rural communities they're designed to help.\n\nWill these roads lead to economic ruin or prosperity?

The bridge – usually a wall of slow-moving cars and trucks – was an empty ribbon of asphalt. The border had been closed to tourists or people visiting family, although a wide variety of essential workers had been permitted to cross during the closure. During that time, Mexican nationals holding tourist cards were banned from traveling over the land border; air travel between points in the interior of both countries never ceased.\n\n\"It's been two years,\" said Lizbeth Castellanos. \"We're going to Marshalls and Walmart.\"\n\nThe crossing reopened at just after midnight Eastern time. At 6 a.m. Eastern, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported no significant crossing delays at either the Mexico or Canada borders.\n\nSusana Hernández of Juárez was crossing for the first time since the pandemic restrictions to buy clothes in El Paso for her business.

At the pandemic's worst, that number dropped to 30,000, and New York businesses hope the flood of tourists will boost their finances.\n\nTJ Witham, the vice president of communications for the Times Square Alliance, told USA TODAY the alliance chose the red steps as it is an \"iconic meeting place\" for people visiting the Big Apple.\n\nChris Dickson, a 41-year-old bus scheduler from Newcastle, England, flew to New York City on Monday for 48 hours, using credit from a British Airways trip he'd had to cancel seven months ago.\n\nDickson planned to drop his bag at his Brooklyn hotel and start exploring the city he last visited more than two years ago.\n\n\"I just wanted to come to America at the first opportunity,'' he said. \"I'm going to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to go through Central Park, I'm going to do some running, some jogging in that area.

At one point during the spring, he said, the second runway at Heathrow was closed because the airport hadn't seen such a limited number of flights since World War II.\n\n\"This has been a crisis like no other,'' he said Monday after arriving in New York.\n\nDoyle believes the border reopening took too long – the UK and European Union started welcoming US tourists back over the summer – but on Monday said he didn't want to dwell on the past. Instead, he gushed about what the reopening means to British Airways and its passengers.\n\n\"The North Atlantic is very important to British Airways and today's a very, very important turning point and milestone in the future of the country,'' he said.\n\nIs he worried travel restrictions could return if COVID cases spike on either side of the Atlantic?\n\n\"You always have to keep an eye on things,'' he said. \"But I do think that we're seeing a sort of pragmatic framework emerge across a number of jurisdictions.''\n\nHe said he hopes that that framework – basing entry requirements on vaccination and testing – remains despite any COVID trends going forward.\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson, Morgan Hines, USA TODAY\n\nAnticipation at airports\n\nAhead of the British Airways first flight arrival, family members waited in the Terminal 7 arrivals area at New York's John F.

She said she missed having the help they could have provided with a newborn.\n\n\"It was absolutely horrible. I think it's been the hardest time of my life.

Barbour, 41, said the airports were busy but staff seemed cheerful despite long lines.\n\n\"We honestly wouldn't travel if we felt unsafe or nervous, we are fully vaccinated and will wear our masks.

The country also cut off nonessential travel across the U.S. land borders with Mexico and Canada in March 2020.\n\nIt wasn't until September that the White House announced that it would end the travel ban for fully vaccinated travelers – months after many other nations reopened to U.S. tourists.\n\nThe new U.S. entry requirements, which went into effect Monday, require foreign air passengers to test negative for the virus before boarding a plane to the country and, if they are 18 or older, show proof of full vaccination. Travelers entering the U.S. on land or by ferry for nonessential reasons also need to show proof of vaccination.\n\nAs airports and border crossings get adjusted to the new travel rules, international travelers should prepare for lines.\n\nThe first flight from a country listed the travel ban is set to fly into Chicago from Dublin just before 7 a.m. CT, according to flight tracker Flight Aware and flight-data firm OAG.\n\nPlenty more will follow; there are more than 2 million international flights scheduled to arrive in the U.S. next month, compared to just 728,820 in December of 2020, according to OAG and Flight Aware.\n\n— Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY\n\n► US drops travel ban:Expect bottlenecks at airports under strict entry rules", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/10/11/why-north-carolina-flood-helene-scientists-orographic-effect/75625881007/", "title": "Why did it flood so badly in North Carolina? Scientists point to this", "text": "Hurricane Helene is now in the records of one of the most deadly storms to hit the United States in the last 50 years and the majority of the death toll so far comes from flooding and the resulting devastation caused by it in Western North Carolina.\n\nThe storm has claimed more than 230 lives, with about half reportedly coming from communities across Western North Carolina. And that number keeps rising as the search continues for those still missing.\n\nHelene hit Western North Carolina as a tropical storm on Friday, Sept. 27, bringing inches of rain to an already saturated area causing rivers to burst from their banks, flooding communities and in some cases sweeping them downriver to become hazardous debris.\n\nThe question is, why was flooding so bad in this area?\n\nThere are several scientific theories on why this area saw double digits of rain in a four day stretch, one being the orographic effect.\n\nWhat is the orographic effect?\n\nThe orographic effect occurs when air masses are forced to flow over high topography, aka the mountains, according to Penn State.\n\nAs these air masses rise over mountains, they cool and water vapor condenses. When this happens precipitation forms and is commonly concentrated on the windward side of mountains, this rainfall increases with elevation in the direction of storm tracks. When it continues to cool past the dewpoint, the amount of water vapor in the air can't exceed the point of saturation, so it comes down as condensation and precipitation.\n\nHelene was a fast-moving storm, but when it hit the mountains this orographic effect took place, according to University of South Carolina Geography Professor Cary Mock, who studies hurricane history as a geographer and climatologist.\n\n\"Normally, fast-moving storms are less of a rain hazard, but Helene was a big exception. In the southern Blue Ridge Mountains, Helene’s rain was enhanced by the terrain and what’s known as orographic uplift. When a storm is forced to rise up a mountainside, the air cools and condenses, dropping more precipitation,\" Mock wrote in a recent piece for the school.\n\n\"In the mountains, that rainfall quickly funnels into streams and rivers. Asheville, North Carolina, a fast-growing city of about 95,000 residents, is located in a bowl in mountainous terrain. That left it and other nearby cities highly susceptible to high river runoff and extreme flooding. To make matters worse, the area was already saturated from a storm just ahead of Helene.\"\n\nRainfall stalling over Western NC mountains ahead of Helene\n\nRainfall from Helene was already predicted to cause flooding in places no matter what, but in Western North Carolina a weather front stalled at the Appalachians ahead of Tropical Storm Helene which exacerbated the flooding, David Easterling, a rain expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, said to USA TODAY.\n\nHow much rain fell in Western North Carolina due to Tropical Storm Helene?\n\nWhile Helene dumped rain on the western portion of the Carolinas, the area had already been drenched the week before by storms. Here's how many inches of rain communities saw between Tuesday, Sept. 24 and Saturday, Sept. 28, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBusick in Yancey County had the most recorded rain in the period of time at 30.78 inches\n\nSpruce Pine: 24.12 inches\n\nHendersonville: 21.96 inches\n\nMountain Home: 17.09 inches\n\nCandler: 16.18 inches\n\nTryon: 15.78 inches\n\nGrandfather Mountain: 15.42 inches\n\nHighlands: 14.86 inches\n\nBanner Elk: 14.85 inches\n\nMills River: 13.26 inches\n\nSwannanoa: 13.21 inches\n\nHow high did rivers in Western NC get during Helene?\n\nRivers across the region still remain swollen a week after Helene first hit down on the region. On Sept. 27, rivers burst from their banks surpassing major flood stages by more than 10 feet in some areas. Rivers overtook communities across Western North Carolina, almost swallowing whole communities leaving nothing behind but mud and debris.\n\nAt its peak, the French Broad River in Fletcher crested at 30.31 feet on Sept. 27 as Helene moved through the area, according to the North Carolina State Climate Office out of North Carolina State University. In Asheville, the French Broad hit 24.67 feet, 1.5 feet above its previous highest crest. Further downstream at Blantyre, the river surpassed its 1916 crest of 27.1 feet to hit 27.38 feet before the gauge stopped reporting on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Swannanoa River at Biltmore crested at 26.1 feet, more than five feet above what it did at its maximum in 1916 and slightly above the apparent 26-foot crest in April 1791, noted the climate office.\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/05/andalusia-mansion-bensalem-bucks-county-history/7812860002/", "title": "Visit to Andalusia mansion in Bensalem a trip back in time", "text": "Carl LaVO\n\nCorrespondent\n\nAndalusia. The melodious name conjures up romance and foreign adventure.\n\nAt least that’s what it’s always seemed to me after arriving in Bucks County from Florida. One of my first stops was the Biddle family's grand Greek Revival mansion from which the Bensalem neighborhood draws its name.\n\nThe gleaming white edifice defines an area along the Delaware River from the Philadelphia border on Poquessing Creek upriver about a mile to the area of today’s Woodhaven Road.\n\nThe community might have gotten a different name had a developer achieved his dream in the 19th century. Steven Sicard in 1820 purchased a large tract of mostly farmland near the mansion and subdivided it into development lots from which to create the town of — drum roll, please — “Sicardville.” Ugh! Fortunately, the idea was a flop. The town never took shape. Dreamy Andalusia persevered as a place name.\n\nA public wharf edging the upstream boundary of the Biddle property became the gateway to Bucks, attracting sailboats and steamships when the river was Main Street in the 1800s. The wharf was extraordinary as a day-tripper destination.\n\n“Through the trees, a few hundred yards below the landing, could be seen ‘Andalusia,’ the beautiful country seat of the Biddles,” according to one historical account. “The wharf, buildings and all surroundings were kept in excellent repair. Sloping stretches of green lawn were studded with ornamental shrubbery and trees and a paved driveway led to the wharf. Nearby was an attractive picnic ground called ‘Chestnut Grove,’ frequented by schools, societies and pleasure parties, most of them coming from Philadelphia.”\n\nA different invasion:LaVO: George Washington may have defeated the Hessians in Trenton, but these Hessian invaders conquered Bucks County\n\nRethinking Robert Morris:LaVO: Why has America turned its back on Morrisville’s Robert Morris?\n\nBucks County place names:LaVO: All about Aberystwith, the Bucks County town you may never have heard of\n\nEye candy was the mansion on a distant rise. Shipping magnate John Craig of Philadelphia built the home on 100 acres in 1797. He and his brother-in-law made a fortune in trade with Spanish provinces in South America.\n\nCraig fell in love with New Andalusia, a former portion of today’s Venezuela on the Atlantic coast west of Orinoco River. He was so taken with the locale he named his new home Andalusia.\n\nAfter Craig’s daughter Jane married up-and-coming Philadelphia financier Nicholas Biddle in 1811, the couple inherited the mansion. Biddle vastly remodeled and enlarged it into his vision of “a Greek temple on a hill,” proclaiming, “There are two truths in the world – the Bible and Greek architecture.”\n\nIn 1833 he hired architect Thomas Ustick Walter, who designed the U.S. Capitol dome. Massive Doric columns soon enwrapped Andalusia. The results seemed a dream of antiquity to passing boaters on the Delaware.\n\nThe Biddles entertained many notables at “the Big House,” including John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, the Marquis de Lafayette and Napoleon Bonaparte’s brother Joseph, exiled king of Spain living in Bordentown, New Jersey.\n\nMeanwhile, the wharf enhanced a hot real estate market. The banks of the river on both sides of the Biddle estate sprouted new mansions. Architectural wonders with strange names included the mansions Foerderer (today’s Glen Foerd), Red Gables, Windemere, Edgewood, the Dell, Chestnut Wood, Traviskan, Devon and the Old Bickley Place (now Pen Ryn).\n\nAt the wharf, steamboats carrying sightseers and commuters arrived twice daily, three times on Sundays. Among them was the 220-foot-long paddlewheeler Columbia, the most luxurious vessel plying the upper Delaware. A shipboard orchestra made moonlight cruises memorable for hundreds of passengers.\n\nWhen steamship travel became less popular, the Biddle and Bickley families demolished the wharf and closed the park. Andalusia remained the centerpiece of the community. Few families in Bucks were as prominent.\n\nNicholas Biddle’s father Charles was a captain in the merchant marine during the Revolutionary War and close friend of Benjamin Franklin. Nick’s namesake Uncle Nicholas was a Continental Navy ship’s captain who lost his life in battle with an English warship off Barbados.\n\nHis other uncle Edward was a lawyer, soldier and delegate to the Continental Congress. Older brother James became a U.S. Navy commodore who opened China to U.S. trade. Younger brother Thomas was a hero of the War of 1812.\n\nAs for the younger Nicholas, he graduated with a law degree from Princeton at age 15, then traveled extensively in Europe where he attended the French coronation of Napoleon and helped audit the Louisiana Purchase in Paris.\n\nJust 21, he returned to Philadelphia in 1807 to practice law and edited Lewis and Clark’s report to Thomas Jefferson on their epic Western exploration. Biddle’s career at home accelerated in 1819 as director and eventual president of the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia.\n\nNick’s Andalusia estate remains in the Biddle family to the present day. The lavishly furnished mansion is preserved as a “museum house” by the Andalusia Foundation, which hosts tours. Proceeds go to estate upkeep.\n\nA visit is to gain an appreciation of old Andalusia and the Biddle family, particularly Nicholas Biddle, who famously said of the federal government, “Nothing but widespread suffering will produce any effect on Congress.”\n\nHow you can visit Bensalem's mansion district\n\nThree 19th century mansions including the Biddle family home are open to the public. They’re all within a mile of one another on State Road in Bensalem.\n\nGLEN FEORD (circa 1850): The 3-story riverfront house built on the Philadelphia border is in a park-like setting overlooking Poquessing Creek. Visitors can view the estate’s ice house, Gothic-style gatehouse, 60-foot-high stone water tower, five large greenhouses and riverfront cupola, all open to the public from 8 a.m. to dusk daily. Free tours of the mansion are offered on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Information: https://www.glenfoerd.org/\n\nANDALUSIA (1797): The ancestral home of the Biddle family is a paradise of native woodlands and spectacular gardens. The mansion is one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the U.S. Tour dates, times and capacities are limited. Reservations must be made online in advance for all tours. Details on the web at https://andalusiapa.org/\n\nPEN RYN (1744): Abraham Bickley, a wealthy shipping merchant, built the mansion, later renamed Pen Ryn. In 1993, the property was privately purchased and meticulously restored to its original grandeur. Today it’s available for weddings, banquets, corporate meetings and group tours.

And anyone who witnessed his recent Got Back tour knows that he also still clearly revels in playing 30-plus nuggets from his catalog at every show, grinning through “Live and Let Die,” storytelling before “Blackbird,” giddily leading the sing-along on “Hey Jude.”\n\nHis joy for music is infectious and for that, we thank him.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'It's your fault!':Paul McCartney blames Bruce Springsteen for epic-length concerts\n\nSo here is an imperfect list of 82 of our favorites from The Beatles, Wings and his solo catalog. Songs that he wrote that became hits for others (such as Badfinger’s \"Come and Get It\" and Elvis Costello’s “Veronica”) weren’t included. And for those Beatles songs co-written with John Lennon, if McCartney included them in his book “The Lyrics,” they were under consideration.\n\nSo happy birthday, Sir Paul. You make your brilliance look so easy.\n\n82. 'Souvenir' (1997)\n\nThough written during what McCartney has described as “a lazy holiday,” the “Flaming Pie” track is coiled with emotion. Against a soulful backdrop spiked with electric guitar, McCartney promises a friend that “When you’re fed up, shedding too many tears … I will come to you to ease the pain.”\n\n81. ‘Ebony and Ivory’ (1982)\n\nThis duet with Stevie Wonder – a first for McCartney with another major artist – is much maligned because of its simplified ode to racial harmony. But it’s hard to fault McCartney’s intentions – or the song’s easily digestible tunefulness.\n\n80. ‘Biker Like An Icon’ (1993)\n\nPossessing more of a rock edge, the single from “Off the Ground” was a minor hit in Germany, but is best known for the origin of its title: McCartney and wife Linda were discussing cameras and their phrases “I like a Leica” and “I like a Nikon” merged into a story about a girl who liked a biker … like an icon.\n\n79. ‘Come on to Me’ (2018)\n\nThe topic of how to pick someone up at a party isn’t novel, but McCartney turns the notion into an engaging challenge, buoyed by a stomping, uncomplicated chorus.\n\n78. ‘Temporary Secretary’ (1980)\n\nKraftwerk-esque electronic elements color the song with an almost incomprehensible sound for a McCartney effort. But – and this is why it squeaked onto the list – it can be considered a bold zigzag that, in retrospect, is at least interesting.\n\nReview:The Beatles' final, AI-assisted song is wistful, quintessential John Lennon\n\n77. ‘The Kiss of Venus’ (2020)\n\nMcCartney aimed to duplicate the do-it-yourself format of his first album with “McCartney III,” his most recent release. While his voice might have more warble to it, his ability to turn the bucolic into something infinitely listenable is still formidable.\n\n76. ‘Waterfalls’ (1980)\n\nA sparse backdrop – Fender Rhodes electric piano and eventual acoustic guitar – paired with layered vocals, this underrated ballad from “McCartney II” is yet another indication of the man’s inimitable ability to make even the small things sound grand.\n\n75. ‘C Moon’ (1972)\n\nSo unfussy that a child could easily sing along, the other side of Wings’ “Hi Hi Hi” single – in the key of C, of course – follows the same lite-reggae format as its companion, with a xylophone!\n\n74. ‘Queenie Eye’ (2013)\n\nBased on a game McCartney played as a child, the chant-along chorus is infectious on its own, but the rest of the song is indicative of a genius of melody whose touch remained deft 60 years into a career.\n\n73. ‘Daytime Nighttime Suffering’ (1979)\n\nWith harmonizing reminiscent of Crosby, Stills & Nash, the B-side to “Goodnight Tonight” is a feast of poppy synths and raspy high-hats.\n\n72. ‘Put It There’ (1990)\n\n“As long as you and I are here, put it there,” goes the chorus of this acoustic guitar-fronted testimony of the strength of a mere handshake, wrapped in delicacy and finesse.\n\n71. ‘Say Say Say’ (1983)\n\nThe lead single from “Pipes of Peace,” this second pairing with Michael Jackson (they teamed for the Jackson-written “The Girl is Mine” in 1982), lopes along on a lightly funky shuffle beat under the pristine production by George Martin.\n\n70. ‘Little Lamb Dragonfly’ (1973)\n\nFrom Wings’ “Red Rose Speedway” album, the six-plus-minute gentle folk ballad is often connected to McCartney’s switch to vegetarianism. In addition, it’s enchanting.\n\n69. ‘Hope of Deliverance’ (1992)\n\nInjected with layers of percussion to provide a soft Latin touch, the “Off the Ground” single isn’t among McCartney’s most musically challenging songs, but its message of optimism never fades.\n\n68. ‘Venus and Mars/Rock Show’ (1975)\n\nA bit like Elton John’s “Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,” this medley of two songs taken from the “Venus and Mars” album is a delectable melding of woodsy folk that escalates into a four-on-the-floor rocker.\n\n67. ‘Things We Said Today’ (1964)\n\nThe B-side to “A Hard Day’s Night” has since been described by McCartney as “future nostalgia.” Which means he’d probably like a chat with Dua Lipa.\n\n66. ‘Hi Hi Hi’ (1972)\n\nPaired with “C Moon” (see No. 74), the uncomplicated rock song is often remembered for being banned by the BBC for supposed sexually suggestive lyrical content.\n\n65. ‘The World Tonight’ (1997)\n\nA modest hit from the “Flaming Pie” album deserves a deeper listen for its combination of a serrated guitar riff, musical and vocal contributions from Jeff Lynne and astute lyrics (“I go back so far, I'm in front of me”).\n\n64. ‘Mull of Kintyre’ (1977)\n\nA massive hit in the U.K. for good reason – the Wings strummer is a love letter to the Kintyre peninsula in Scotland, the locale of McCartney’s haven, the remote High Park Farm. Bagpipes lend not only authenticity but wistful glory.\n\n63. ‘Jenny Wren’ (2005)\n\nUtilizing the guitar-plucking style employed on “Blackbird,” as well as a duduk played by Pedro Eustache, the tender acoustic ballad is supposedly named for the character of the same name in Charles Dickens’ novel, “Our Mutual Friend.”\n\n62. ‘Martha My Dear’ (1968)\n\nPenned in tribute to McCartney’s Old English Sheepdog, Martha, the piano-heavy selection from “The White Album” is often tied to The Beatles’ inner-band turmoil at the time, as McCartney played all of the instruments on the tune.\n\n61. ‘My Love’ (1973)\n\nA valentine to beloved wife Linda that could be seen as a companion to “Maybe I'm Amazed.” Except for the unfettered devotion in the latter is replaced by swooping strings and a gushy chorus that merely offer an antiseptic veneer.\n\n60. ‘Another Day’ (1971)\n\nNoteworthy because it’s McCartney’s debut single following The Beatles’ breakup in 1970, and was therefore instantly dissected with microscopic precision. Often dismissed as trite, the song actually unveils a vivid portrait of sadness (“Alone in her apartment she'd dwell/'til the man of her dreams comes to break the spell”).\n\n59. ‘We Can Work it Out’ (1965)\n\nIssued as a double A-side with “Day Tripper,” the jangly pop submission is another exemplary example of the equilibrium between McCartney (supposedly writing about then-girlfriend Jane Asher) and Lennon (more interested in mortality with his “life is very short” contribution).\n\n'1964: Eyes of the Storm':See Paul McCartney's personal photos of The Beatles from his new book\n\n58. ‘Goodnight Tonight’ (1979)\n\nNot that McCartney needed another vehicle for his unparalleled bass playing, but the disco-funk he crafted not only ideally fit its era, but did so with percussive panache.\n\n57. ‘Arrow Through Me’ (1979)\n\nWith its heavy bass intro meshed with electric piano, the lightly funky inclusion on Wings’ “Back to the Egg” album is enticingly scattershot, with horns and a clavinet providing an R&B vibe.\n\n56. ‘Ever Present Past’ (2007)\n\nA genial selection from McCartney’s “Memory Almost Full” album finds its sweet spot in the chorus (“the things I think I did” quickly lodges in your brain), but also finds him embracing nostalgia (“Looking back It went by/it went by, in a flash”) wrapped in a warm synth-pop blanket.\n\n55. ‘Tug of War’ (1982)\n\nThe title track from McCartney’s 11th post-Beatles album captures him in a vulnerable state, realizing over a sublime orchestral arrangement and striking horns that there will always be “pushing, pushing/pulling, pulling.”\n\n54. ‘Sing the Changes’ (The Fireman, 2008)\n\nMcCartney’s semi-secret side project with Killing Joke bassist Youth – their album “Electric Arguments” the root – spawned this ethereal loveliness with echo-y vocals and a chorus so exquisite, it would make Coldplay shudder.\n\n53. ‘So Bad’ (1983)\n\nInitially released as the B-side to “Pipes of Peace,” the sweet ballad spotlighting McCartney’s falsetto later landed on his 1984 “Give My Regards to Broad Street” soundtrack.\n\n52. ‘With a Little Luck’ (1978)\n\nAnother from the Paul is Eternal Optimist canon that is so earnest, his idealistic lyrical declarations almost overshadow the prominent synthesizers that paint the swirly splendor of the song.\n\n51. ‘Silly Love Songs’ (1976)\n\nIs the song lightweight? Yes. Indicative of McCartney’s desire to stay on the charts (i.e., commercial)? Sure. But it’s also unfairly maligned because Macca is completely in on the ridiculously catchy joke. And what’s wrong with that? I’d like to know.\n\n50. ‘Off the Ground’ (1993)\n\nHandclaps and stinging electric guitar are complemented by a sweet chorus, its “la la la’s” giving the song the weightless vibe it strives to project.\n\n49. 'I'll Follow the Sun' (1964)\n\nMcCartney notes The Beatles' \"aversion to repeating ourselves\" as he explains in \"The Lyrics\" the creation of this sweet, simple strummer that begs for optimism amid the clouds.\n\n48. ‘Nineteen Hundred And Eighty Five’ (1974)\n\nThe potent piano chords that open the song endow it with energy, but lyrically, the final track on Wings’ “Band on the Run” album subscribes to the same theme of emotional claustrophobia as the title track.\n\n47. ‘Despite Repeated Warnings’ (2018)\n\nAnyone who thinks McCartney’s edges have dulled with age need to give this nearly seven-minute epic a spin. One of the final tracks on “Egypt Station” is as layered and musically complex as anything The Beatles created in their most inventive period while offering a pointed commentary on global warming and politics.\n\n46. ‘Birthday’ (1968)\n\nSome (ahem) may find the repetition and overt minimalism of the lyrics annoying, but that same person will concede that the guitar riff is an undeniable earworm.\n\n45. ‘My Brave Face’ (1989)\n\nAmong the pack of songs co-written with Elvis Costello for 1989’s “Flowers in the Dirt” album, this beauty opens with a constellation of harmony vocals that lead the song – with its especially Costello-ish bridge – down its poppy path.\n\n44. ‘All My Loving’ (1963)\n\nBetween the intricate guitar work from George Harrison and Lennon and a set of double-tracked vocals, a new sound in 1960s British pop was born. For the trivia geeks: This was the opening song of The Beatles’ “Ed Sullivan Show” debut in February 1964.\n\n43. ‘Helen Wheels’ (1973)\n\nNamed for the Land Rover McCartney and Linda used to travel around Scotland, the guitar-rocker gives listeners the opportunity to travel the countryside with the pair with nods to Liverpool, Birmingham and London along the way.\n\n42. ‘When I’m Sixty-Four’ (1967)\n\nKeep this in mind whenever you read anything about McCartney: He wrote this song when he was about 14. As in years old. As in, that is an insane amount of foresight, even for this guy.\n\n41. ‘I Want To Hold Your Hand’ (1963)\n\nThe first U.S. No. 1 for The Beatles captures them in their wide-eyed, bowl-haircut youth, cheerfully nodding their heads as they proclaim their innocent intention.\n\n40. ‘Mistress and Maid’ (1993)\n\nAnother co-write with Elvis Costello from the underappreciated “Off the Ground” album is a gorgeous waltz paired with devastating lyrics about a woman in a passion-devoid relationship.\n\n39. ‘Listen to What the Man Said’ (1975)\n\nThe gliding soft-rocker – a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for Wings – is also a creamy love song with memorable lyrical imagery (“soldier boy kisses girl/leaves behind a tragic world”).\n\n38. ‘With a Little Help From My Friends’ (1967)\n\nPerhaps more of a genuine Lennon-McCartney collaboration – and sung by Ringo Starr – the swaying avowal of camaraderie is a delightful arrangement of shifting time patterns and sing-along-ability.\n\n37. ‘Eight Days a Week’ (1964)\n\nAnother iconic guitar opening from early-era Beatles leads into a perfect permutation of double-tracked vocals and a phrase/chorus that has insinuated itself into the lexicon.\n\n36. ‘Drive My Car’ (1965)\n\nNot the only Beatles song about sex, but perhaps the most subtle.\n\n35. ‘Coming Up’ (1980)\n\nPart of McCartney’s new wave/disco phase of the times that initially included sped-up vocals. But in the U.S., the live version – with normal vocals – became the No. 1 hit, much like “Maybe I’m Amazed.”\n\n34. ‘I’ve Got a Feeling’ (1970)\n\nBack in the headlines due to McCartney using Lennon’s isolated vocal tracks to duet with him on his current tour, the blues-leaning rock song is a meshing of two unfinished tracks – McCartney’s “I’ve Got a Feeling” and Lennon’s “Everybody Had a Hard Year.”\n\n33. ‘Let ’Em In’ (1976)\n\nNot many radio hits can claim success through the use of a doorbell chime, a vibraphone, flutes and a marching beat. As usual, McCartney scribbled all over the blueprint.\n\n32. ‘Ob-la-di, Ob-la da’ (1968)\n\nNaturally, Lennon reportedly despised the bouncy bop that borrowed heavily from Jamaican ska and utilized a phrase from Nigerian musician Jimmy Scott, a friend of McCartney’s. We’ll just call it lightweight fun.\n\n31. ‘Fixing a Hole’ (1967)\n\nThe addition of a harpsichord infused the song with a baroque-pop sound that countered the relative apathy of the lyrics: “And it really doesn’t matter if I’m wrong or right/where I belong I’m right.”\n\n30. ‘Jet’ (1973)\n\nTo read McCartney’s various explanations about the song’s origins, it’s either about his and Linda’s Labrador puppy, a pony he owned at some point, or meeting Linda’s father for the first time. So just enjoy the music.\n\n29. ‘Here Today’ (1982)\n\nEvery time you hear this emotionally piercing heart-melter that McCartney wrote following Lennon’s shocking murder, you’ll be moved to share your own affirmations of love with the most important friends in your life.\n\n28. ‘The Fool on the Hill’ (1967)\n\nRecorded during the “Magical Mystery Tour” film sessions, the seesawing ballad was deeply motivated by The Beatles’ meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru who McCartney felt suffered unfair detractors.\n\n27. ‘Take it Away’ (1982)\n\nThe squishy bass line leads into Ringo Starr’s identifiable drumming and a surprising blast of horns, urging the song from a midtempo head-nodder to a comfortable gallop.\n\n26. ‘She’s Leaving Home’ (1967)\n\nThe narrative of parents realizing their daughter had absconded in the early-morning hours is a lyrical heartache, but one that McCartney (with a vocal assist from Lennon) delivers with reflective sensitivity.\n\n25. ‘Getting Better’ (1967)\n\nWritten primarily by McCartney, the sunshiny “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” offering nonetheless thoroughly exemplifies the contrasting personalities of McCartney and Lennon with the former endlessly positive (“I’ve got to admit, it’s getting better/a little better all the time”) and Lennon chiming in the background with the cynical, “It can’t get no worse.”\n\n24. ‘Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey’ (1971)\n\nAn unlikely hit given its piecemeal arrangement, vocal effects and bird chirps. But its inventiveness helped earn McCartney’s first Grammy Award as a solo artist (best arrangement accompanying vocalists in 1971).\n\n23. ‘For No One’ (1966)\n\nLyrically brutal (“And in her eyes you see nothing/no sign of love behind the tears”), the emotional blow is cushioned by the mesmerizing cadence.\n\n22. ‘Junior’s Farm’ (1974)\n\nMcCartney’s storytelling instincts are on point as he delivers another set of characters to envision (the poker man, the Eskimo, the grocer) while prodding us to join what sounds like an incredible party on Junior’s farm.\n\n21. ‘No More Lonely Nights’ (1984)\n\nAccented by a spotless guitar solo from Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour, the centerpiece of the “Give My Regards to Broad Street” soundtrack is part hopeful prayer (“May I never miss the thrill/of being near you”) and part open-hearted pledge (“You’re my guiding light/day or night I’m always there”).\n\n20. ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ (1967)\n\nA bit of psychedelia, a cache of trumpets and a dollop of cheesy razzle-dazzle (The Beatles starred in a TV movie of the same name). But it’s still irresistible.\n\n19. ‘Lady Madonna’ (1968)\n\nFervent piano with a boogie-woogie vibe and lyrics that subtly nod to McCartney’s mother, Mary, a midwife during his childhood, provide one of the most R&B-leaning offerings from The Beatles.\n\n18. ‘Live and Let Die’ (1973)\n\nNow regarded for the eardrum-popping pyro that accompanies the live rendition – which McCartney is still performing – the oft-covered symphonic rocker could have become the first James Bond theme to win an Oscar but lost to Barbra Streisand’s “The Way We Were.”\n\n17. ‘The End’ (1969)\n\nAt just over two minutes, the mostly instrumental platform would barely be a blip for most bands. But when you’re The Beatles, your song can contain a single lyric and it’s worthy of being etched in perpetuity: “The love you take is equal to the love you make.”\n\n16. ‘Paperback Writer’ (1966)\n\nA clever, zippy power popper that also prominently features McCartney’s bass as the song whooshes by in a heady rush.\n\n15. ‘Hey Jude’ (1968)\n\nThe words of comfort written for a young, gloomy Julian Lennon have become the definitive singalong at McCartney’s live shows. But also, it’s seven-plus minutes of grand piano supplemented by the most famous coda this side of “Layla.\"\n\n14. ‘Get Back’ (1969)\n\nThose who watched The Beatles’ “Get Back” documentary will recall their jaws dropping as the essence of the song tumbled out of McCartney’s head, eventually being fashioned into the sprinting guitar-rocker that would live in music lore.\n\n13. ‘Band on the Run’ (1974)\n\nThe brooding opening adeptly captures the impending dread of feeling cornered (“if we ever get outta here”) before a sunburst of acoustic guitar and sublime chorus carry us through the great escape.\n\n12. ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ (1967)\n\nBoth the opening track to the album of the same name and its groove-infested reprise are a gleeful dismantling of traditional song structure. Instrumental bridges mesh with refrains that bump into verses− and it’s all a glorious sound.\n\n11. ‘Here, There and Everywhere’ (1966)\n\nIt’s no secret that McCartney says he was inspired by The Beach Boys’ equally soul-gripping “God Only Knows” when he wrote this delicate musical poem about realizing what you have when you have it.\n\n10. ‘Blackbird’ (1968)\n\nMusically inspired by Bach’s lute piece “Bourrée in E minor” and lyrically inspired by the civil rights struggle in the U.S., the tranquil guitar ballad remains a metaphoric stunner.\n\n9. ‘The Long and Winding Road’ (1970)\n\nReleased a month after The Beatles’ breakup, the soaring piano ballad – akin to “Let it Be” – finds McCartney in a particularly pensive mode, whether referencing the Phil Spector orchestrated version or the more straightforward original.\n\n8. ‘Got To Get You Into My Life’ (1966)\n\nMcCartney explains in “The Lyrics” that the song so many of us have digested as a pleading, you-make-my-life-complete sentiment is actually his ode to discovering marijuana.\n\n7. ‘Let It Be’ (1970)\n\nThe Beatles’ final single before McCartney departed for a solo career, its grandiosity cannot be overstated. It’s also the only known Beatles song to feature backing vocals from Linda McCartney.\n\n6. ‘I Will’ (1968)\n\nThe clip-clopping rhythm is an ideal balance to lyrics that are honeyed but never cloying (“And when at last I find you/your song will fill the air/sing it loud so I can hear you”).\n\n5. ‘Yesterday’ (1965)\n\nOne of the most covered songs in music history (the tally is more than 2,200), the aching lament McCartney has said came to him in a dream remains classic due to its sparseness and honesty.\n\n4. ‘Eleanor Rigby’ (1966)\n\nMcCartney’s flair for character creation creates a palpable melancholy as he sings about a lonely old woman laid to rest by an equally lonely minister (Father McKenzie). The sawing strings only add to its bleak beauty.\n\n3. ‘Two of Us’ (1969)\n\nWhile obviously, the lyrical sentiment contains romantic implications, the veritable love affair is really between McCartney and Lennon, their friendship and creative partnership an enviable match.\n\n2. ‘Penny Lane’ (1967)\n\nForget about the astute narration (barbershops, bankers and roundabouts). Don’t even pay much attention to the heavenly pop melody. Listen to the supple bass line, which dances throughout the song as its own character.\n\n1. ‘Maybe I’m Amazed’ (1977, live)\n\nInitially released on his 1970 self-titled solo album, the apex of McCartney’s luminosity arrived years later on Wings’ live “Wings Over America” album, when the song became a hit. The original is a gratifying valentine. But this live version unleashes McCartney, who comes undone with ragged, feral vocals that will rearrange your molecules as he bares his utter devotion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}]}

How NFL decides", "text": "Super Bowl 59 may be in a neutral venue, but the box scores will indicate that the Philadelphia Eagles were the home team on Sunday, while the Kansas City Chiefs will be filling the role of the road team.\n\nThe NFL may pick Super Bowl venues years in advance, but things like team record and geography aren't factors in who the \"home\" team is once the AFC and NFC champions collide. Kansas City's superior record this season isn't relevant, and you don't have to figure out which team happens to be closer to the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nThe league has a system in place, and the outcome for this year's Super Bowl is that Philadelphia will go into the record books as playing a home game. That might not be the blessing that it seems, as away teams have won roughly 55% of Super Bowls over the years.\n\nHere's what to know about how the NFL sorted out who the home team is at Super Bowl 59:\n\nEagles vs. Chiefs:What time is Super Bowl 59? Start time, channel, stream\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSuper Bowl 59: How NFL decides which team is home, away\n\nGoing all the way back to the very first Super Bowl in 1967, a very simple system has been in place for sorting who the home and away teams are. In Super Bowl 1, played at the LA Coliseum, the NFC's Green Bay Packers were the \"home\" team.\n\nSince then, the conferences have traded off, with the AFC being the home team in even-numbered years, and the NFC taking the odd-numbered years.\n\nWho is the home team for Super Bowl 59?\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are the home team for Super Bowl 59, while the Kansas City Chiefs have been designated as the away team. The fact that the Chiefs had a better record, or are the defending champions, is irrelevant. The NFL's policy of alternating which conference champion gets to be the home team is what settles the issue.\n\nThe game is at a neutral venue (New Orleans' Caesars Superdome), but the NFL still elects a home and away team to sort through a couple of procedural issues. Being the home team, the Eagles get first pick on their uniform, obliging the Chiefs to pick something that contrasts. On the (literal) flip side, Kansas City will be asked to call the coin toss to determine who kicks off to start the game.\n\nSuper Bowl 59 uniforms:What Chiefs, Eagles will wear in New Orleans\n\nHow to watch Super Bowl 2025: Time, TV channel, streaming\n\nSuper Bowl 59 will be broadcast nationwide on Fox.

Their 2018 track \"All the Stars\" from \"Black Panther: The Album\" received an Oscar nomination for best original song.\n\nWho played in Super Bowl 2024?\n\nLast year, Super Bowl 58 was between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, with the Chiefs winning 25-22.\n\nWho won Super Bowl 2023?\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was between the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, with Kansas City winning 38-35.\n\nWhen was the last time the Eagles went to the Super Bowl?\n\nPhiladelphia's most recent Super Bowl appearance was in 2023 against the Kansas City Chiefs. They lost that game 38-35 after Harrison Butker kicked a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left in regulation, per USA TODAY.\n\nHow many times have the Eagles gone to the Super Bowl?\n\nThe Eagles' trip to Super Bowl 59 will mark their fifth appearance in franchise history. The Eagles have just a 1-3 record in the Super Bowl. The Eagles clinched their only Super Bowl win in 2018 when former quarterback Nick Foles led the team to a 41-33 win over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.\n\nHow many Super Bowls have Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs won?\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl Champions, the Chiefs have won four Lombardi trophies in their franchise history: 1970, 2020, 2023 and 2024. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes has won three Super Bowl titles with the team.\n\nWhen is the NFL MVP announced?\n\nThe NFL MVP award will be announced at the 14th annual NFL Honors ceremony on Feb. 6.

NFL fans could witness a historic championship. There could be the first three-peat champion in the Kansas City Chiefs, who are the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Or there's a very realistic chance the team raising the Lombardi Trophy in New Orleans will be doing it for the first time. Four of nine teams left in the playoffs are going for their first Super Bowl title.\n\nHere's more about this year's Super Bowl:\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2025?\n\nThe Super Bowl is less than a month away.\n\nAll things Packers: Latest Green Bay Packers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nIt's set for Sunday, Feb. 9. Kickoff for the big game is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe game features the NFC champion vs. the AFC champion.\n\nWhere is the Super Bowl 2025?\n\nThe Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans, the 11th time the city will host the game and bringing it into a tie with Miami for the most.\n\nHowever, it's been 12 years since the Super Bowl has come to the Big Easy, the longest such stretch between games for New Orleans. If this year's Super Bowl was anything like the last in New Orleans, NFL fans are in for a treat. And that game wasn't just noteworthy because there was a long delay when the lights went out inside the Superdome.\n\nThat game featured two brothers coaching against each other, the first time that's happened in Super Bowl history. John Harbaugh's Baltimore Ravens outlasted Jim Harbaugh's San Francisco 49ers, 34-31, to win the franchise's second Super Bowl.\n\nThe Packers have fond memories of the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Their third Super Bowl title — Super Bowl XXXI — came at the Superdome when Brett Favre, Reggie White and MVP Desmond Howard led Green Bay past the New England Patriots, 35-21, on Jan. 26, 1997.\n\nNFL playoff bracket\n\nWho will advance to Super Bowl 59?\n\nHere's the updated playoff bracket heading into the final wild-card game Monday.\n\nAre the Packers out of the playoffs?\n\nYes, the Packers were eliminated from the 2024 playoffs Sunday after losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, 22-10.\n\nThe Packers, seeded seventh in the NFC playoffs, finished the season 11-7 and with three straight losses.\n\nIt's the first time the Packers lost in the wild-card round since the 2013 season, when they fell to the San Francisco 49ers, 23-20, at home.\n\nGreen Bay had won their last three wild-card playoff games. In four other seasons the Packers qualified for the playoffs since then, they received byes into the divisional round due to their high seed and bypassed that opening round.\n\nPackers' Super Bowl wins\n\nThe Packers have won four Super Bowls in franchise history, with the last coming in the 2010 season, putting them in a tie with the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants.\n\nOnly the New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers have more Super Bowl wins.\n\nThe Chiefs, however, can pass the Packers in the rankings if they win their third straight Super Bowl next month.\n\nMost Super Bowl wins, ranked\n\nNew England Patriots (6), last coming during the 2018 season and all taking place since the 2001 season.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (6), last coming during the 2008 season, won four of their championships during a six-year span from the 1974 to 1979 seasons.\n\nDallas Cowboys (5), last coming during the 1995 season, won three of four Super Bowls in the early 1990s.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (5), last coming during the 1994 season, won four of their Super Bowls in the 1980s.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (4), won the last two Super Bowls and three of the last five.\n\nNew York Giants (4), last coming in the 2011 season, won one Super Bowl in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (4), last coming in the 2010 season, won the first two Super Bowls during the 1966 and 1967 seasons.\n\nWhat teams have never won a Super Bowl?\n\nThere are 12 teams that have never raised the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThey include the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans.\n\nFour of those teams — the Bills, Lions, Texans and Vikings — are still alive in the 2024 playoffs.\n\nAnd the Lions, the top seed in the NFC, are the betting odds favorite.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2023/02/12/which-cities-will-host-super-bowl-potential-cites-through-2031/11242472002/", "title": "Here's a list of potential Super Bowl host cities through the year 2031", "text": "NOTE: This story was published Feb. 12, 2023.

It will be the first held in Las Vegas.\n\nThe final Super Bowl location that is set in stone is in 2025 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. That will move New Orleans into a tie with Miami for most Super Bowls at 11.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nMany speculate the 2026 Super Bowl will be held at Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers. The Bay area has hosted the Super Bowl two other times.\n\nAfter that, it’s anybody’s guess what will happen in 2027 and beyond.\n\nNEVER MISS A SNAP:Sign up for our NFL newsletter for exclusive content\n\nOnly 15 NFL team cities have played host to Super Bowls.\n\nThey include Miami, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Tampa, Phoenix, San Diego, Houston, Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Jacksonville, Dallas-Fort Worth, Indianapolis and the New York metro area.\n\nWhile it makes sense to host the game in warm weather cities, we’ve seen the reach expanded to cold weather destinations with outdoor stadiums, like MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nObviously, new stadiums make great locales for a Super Bowl, but you also need enough hotels, restaurants and other amenities for the crowds that flock to town.\n\nWith that, here are five locations that could be good venues to hold Super Bowls from 2027-31.\n\n2027: AT&T Stadium, Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth metro area has hosted just one Super Bowl, in 2011. That was two years after Jerry World opened in 2009.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones, the most powerful owner in the NFL, will want a Super Bowl sooner than later. He’s 80 now and will be 84 in 2027.\n\nThe bet is he gets one.\n\n2028: Ford Field, Detroit Lions\n\nFord Field opened in 2002 and hosted a Super Bowl in 2006.\n\nThe Detroit area has done a lot to improve itself over the past decade and Ford Field is a beautiful venue.\n\nIt’s domed, so if the NFL is amenable to holding the Super Bowl in a cold weather city again, it makes sense to do it in Detroit.\n\nIt's just a gut feeling this venue will get to host its second Super Bowl.\n\n2029: New stadium, Buffalo Bills\n\nThe Bills are building a new venue to replace Highmark Stadium that is expected to be ready for the 2026 season. It will cost in the neighborhood of $1.4 to $1.6 billion. That’s a nice neighborhood.\n\nYes, weather is a concern, and it sounds like this will be an open-air stadium. So, it might not be feasible unless you take Global Warming into consideration.\n\nBut let’s watch to see what the plan is and maybe Buffalo can land its first Super Bowl.\n\n2030: New stadium, Tennessee Titans\n\nI chose the Bills’ stadium to get the first shot at a Super Bowl ahead of Nashville because Buffalo has been approved for the funding already, although both hope to open by the 2026 season.\n\nTennessee’s stadium isn’t quite approved yet, but took big steps in the funding approval process in December. The stadium will likely get the full approval later this year.\n\nThe plan is to build a $2.2 billion domed roof stadium adjacent to Nissan Stadium. Nashville is a gem of a city and would be a great destination for a Super Bowl.\n\n2031: TIAA Bank Field, Jacksonville\n\nJacksonville hosted one Super Bowl in 2005, and let’s just say the city had to do a lot just to house guests. You know, like bring in cruise ships to the port so people could have a place to sleep.\n\nYet, the city and team are working toward an agreement that would give a $1 billion facelift to TIAA Bank Field, which is structurally sound, but needs a lot of improvements, such as shade, better amenities, bathrooms, concessions, etc… The hope is to have all this wrapped up by 2029.\n\nThe city is making great strides in improving the downtown area. They’ve torn down a bunch of the blight along the riverfront near the stadium, and now they have a blank canvas and plenty of time to paint on it.\n\nOwner Shad Khan is putting a lot of his own money into the city of Jacksonville, so you’d hope in eight years they’d build enough new infrastructure to give a first-rate Super Bowl experience.\n\nOther considerations\n\nIt's hard to predict Super Bowl locations without projecting Miami or Tampa as destinations. However, Tampa just hosted the Super Bowl in 2021 and Miami in 2020, so they may have to wait a while.\n\nNew York City, of course, always wants the biggest spectacles, so I'm sure there will be a big push to bring another Super Bowl back to the Big Apple.\n\nIt will also be interesting to watch what goes on in Chicago. The Windy City has never held a Super Bowl, but if they replace Soldier Field with a modern, indoor stadium, that would be a great city to host a Super Bowl.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/02/06/super-bowl-sites-potential-cites-through-2032/72484778007/", "title": "Where will the Super Bowl be next year?

It will be the second time the Super Bowl is held there, the first being in 2016.\n\nAfter that, in 2027, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, will host its second Super Bowl, the first coming in 2022.\n\nAfter that, it’s anyone’s guess which venues will host the Super Bowl.\n\nHeads or Tails?Highland Mint will make the flip coin for the 31st consecutive year for Super Bowl 58\n\nOnly 16 NFL team cities have played host to Super Bowls.\n\nThey include Miami, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Tampa, Phoenix, San Diego, Houston, Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Dallas-Fort Worth, Indianapolis and the New York metro area.\n\nWhile it makes sense to host the game in warm weather cities, we’ve seen the reach expanded to cold weather destinations with outdoor stadiums, like MetLife in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nObviously, new stadiums make great locales for a Super Bowl, but you also need enough hotels, restaurants and other amenities for the crowds that flock to town.\n\nWith that, here are five locations I believe will host Super Bowls from 2028-32.\n\n2028: AT&T Stadium, Dallas Cowboys\n\nI had this on my list last year.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth metro area has hosted just one Super Bowl, in 2011. That was two years after Jerry World opened in 2009.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones, the most powerful owner in the NFL, will want a Super Bowl sooner than later. He’s 81 now and will be 85 in 2028.\n\nThe bet is he gets one.\n\n2029: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami\n\nBy the time 2029 rolls around, eight Super Bowls will have passed since one is held in South Florida.\n\nMiami used to be the clubhouse leader for most Super Bowls hosted, but New Orleans will tie it with its 11th Super Bowl in 2025.\n\nWith that much time passing between Miami Super Bowls, it only makes sense that one returns to Hard Rock Stadium (or whatever it may be called five years from now).\n\n2030: New stadium, Tennessee Titans\n\nI haven’t wavered from this pick. I had it in the same spot on last year’s list.\n\nThe plan is to build a $2.2 billion domed roof stadium adjacent to Nissan Stadium.\n\nGround is expected to be broken later this year.\n\nNashville is a gem of a city and has never hosted a Super Bowl. It would be a great destination to host the big game.\n\n2031: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta\n\nThis is new to my list. Atlanta has hosted three Super Bowls and is a top host city for big events.\n\nAtlanta last hosted a Super Bowl in 2019, so by the time 2031 rolls around, it will have been a dozen years.\n\nAtlanta has plenty of hotels, restaurants and a Peachtree Street for every fan. I think they’ll be getting another Super Bowl sooner rather than later.\n\n2032: EverBank Field, Jacksonville\n\nJacksonville hosted one Super Bowl in 2005, and let’s just say the city had to do a lot just to house guests. You know, like bring in cruise ships to the port so people could have a place to sleep.\n\nYet, the city and team are working toward an agreement that would give a roughly $1.5 billion facelift to EverBank Field, which is structurally sound, but needs a lot of improvements, such as shade, better amenities, bathrooms, concessions, etc… The hope is to have all this wrapped up by 2028, give or take.\n\nThe city is making great strides in improving the downtown area. They’ve torn down a bunch of the blight along the riverfront near the stadium, and now they have a blank canvas and plenty of time to paint on it.\n\nLure them in:Jacksonville would use $1.5 million to get back in the game for sports tourism\n\nOwner Shad Khan is putting a lot of his own money into the city of Jacksonville, so you’d hope in seven years they’d build enough new infrastructure to give a first-rate Super Bowl experience.\n\nOther Super Bowl considerations\n\nAt some point, a Super Bowl will return to Tampa. Tampa has hosted five Super Bowls and is a great place for visiting fans and teams during the winter. Plus, you'd think the league might owe the city one since their last one was held during the Pandemic.\n\nIf Chicago can follow through with a new enclosed stadium at the Arlington Heights location it purchased in 2023, this would be a great city for a Super Bowl. Yes, Chicago can have unfriendly weather in February, but it’s never held a Super Bowl, and having a dome would bolster the case for a first one in the Windy City.\n\nHad Buffalo planned a domed stadium, I might have predicted that city, but given they want their new stadium to be open air, I doubt a Super Bowl would come there. Unless they postpone it until June. If the World Cup can be moved to December in Qatar, why can’t the Super Bowl be played in June in Buffalo??
